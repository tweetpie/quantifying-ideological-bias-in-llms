(NBC via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Just like in her career, Jane Fonda used the Golden Globes' platform to speak on deeper issues calling for greater diversity in Hollywood while praising the \"community of storytellers\" as she accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award.\n\nWhile wearing an all-white suit, Fonda raised the Globes' highest honor above her head Sunday before commending storytellers for their vital role in troubled times. She said stories let us \"have empathy, to recognize that for all our diversity, we are all humans.\"\n\n\"We are a community of storytellers, aren't we, and in turbulent, crisis-torn times like these, story-telling has always been essential,\" Fonda said.\n\nThe actor and social activist went on to call for Hollywood's leaders to try to \"expand that tent\" for more diverse voices.\n\nFonda, 83, said there's another \"story we've been afraid to see and hear about ourselves in this industry, about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out, who is offered a seat at the table and who is kept out of the rooms where decisions are made.\"\n\nHer acceptance speech earned applause from Viola Davis, Glenn Close and Andra Day, who won best actress for her role in \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday.\"\n\nFonda was one of the few honorees to accept an award in person at the ceremony in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nIn a video package, Ted Danson called Fonda \"confident and independent\" while \"Captain Marvel\" actor Brie Larson referred to her as a \"real life superhero.\" Kerry Washington and Laverne Cox also paid homage in the video that offered several clips of Fonda's activism and critically-acclaimed film roles such as \"Klute,\" \"Coming Home\" and \"The Electric Horseman.\"\n\nTina Fey and Amy Poehler presented Fonda the Globes' version of a lifetime achievement award.

I feel his spirit.\"\n\nFonda made an impact off-screen by creating organizations to support women's equality and prevent teen pregnancy and improve adolescent health. She released a workout video in 1982 and was active on behalf of liberal political causes.\n\nFor her on-screen efforts, Fonda has been nominated for five Academy Awards and won for the thriller \"Klute\" and the compassionate anti-war drama \"Coming Home.\" Her other prominent films include \"The China Syndrome,\" \"The Electric Horseman\" with Robert Redford, and \"9 to 5\" with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton.

      "text": "Jane Fonda 'Doesn't Know' Who Made Her Iconic Red Protest Coat. I Think I Do.\n\nWe know a lot about the crimson red coat Jane Fonda wears during her \" Fire Drill Fridays ,\" where the actress protests climate change in Washington, D.C.\n\nFonda said it is the last piece of clothing she will buy , in a bid toward sustainable living. It doubled as a mattress last week, when she spent the night in jail. She even loaned it to a cellmate who was chilly-though she took the coat back at bedtime.\n\nWhat we don't know about the coat, and what is quickly becoming the fashion world's biggest scoop, is the answer to a very simple question: Who made this now-famous garment?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Daily Beast reached out to Fonda's representatives. They directed our inquiry to Ira Arlook, chief of advocacy campaigns at Fenton, a public relations firm for social justice organizations like the Green New Deal . Arlook has been on-the-ground with the 81-year-old during all three of her arrests.\n\n\"We're on an [Amtrak] train. Jane doesn't have her coat with her. Doesn't know [who made it],\" Arlook wrote in an email. He did not clarify where Fonda purchased the coat.\n\nWhatever, she has clearly committed to it-and getting arrested every Friday until she has to return to the set of her Netflix series, Grace and Frankie . It's become her uniform, whoever the maker is.\n\nA few minutes searching similar styles online yields a convincing lookalike: the Mackage Mai Double-Face Wool Coat with Waterfall Collar . This option retails for $750 and is also available in black, green, light gray, and sand. It's handmade and unlined.\n\nOne happy customer, Shoes2015, raved in the comments section, \"It's such a classic coat that I will have for years. I love the leather detail on the pockets - this is such a winner!\" (Shoes2015 could not be reached for additional comment.)\n\nIn one photo of a cop cuffing Fonda, the actress' coat also boasts leather-lined pockets.\n\n\"The way the coat falls on the Mackage model is very similar to how it looks on Jane Fonda,\" said Doris Domoszlai-Lantner, a fashion and textile historian. \"Especially when it's open with the sash showing-I'd say it's probably the same coat.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Canadian brand, which has also been seen on Meghan Markle, did not return The Daily Beast's request for comment. For what it's worth, a Bloomingdales' salesperson told us last year that \"all of the it girls\" buy their winter coats from the label.\n\nAnd in an era where civil disobedience has become trendy, Fonda may be the ultimate \"it girl.\"  Though the actress has said she's inspired by today's youth climate crisis activists , Fonda has a long history of activism and dissent that predates the birth of these tweens' parents.\n\nAfter the sex symbol status that Barbarella (1968) brought, Fonda began pivoting to serious roles both on screen ( They Shoot Horses, Don ' t They? ) and off. Her earliest stab at activism included touring military bases in an attempt to dissuade soldiers from fighting in the Vietnam War, earning Fonda multiple arrests in 1970.\n\nAlong the way, Fonda supported the Black Panthers, the burgeoning feminist movement, and American Indian rights. But it was a 1972 photo of the actress sitting on a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun that earned her the ire of Americans back home and the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\"\n\nThe actress has apologized for the optics of that photo , but never her crusade against the war.\n\n\"In terms of the coat's color, what automatically comes to mind for me with red is the association of socialist and communist movements,\" Domoszlai-Lantner said. \"Soviet Russian artists would use colors and visual cues in their artwork as agitational propaganda, creating pieces like plates or textiles that could be mass-produced and that could be sold to the public.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Nancy Pelosi 's affinity for a burnt orange MaxMara coat sent many liberal women in search of their own. But Fonda has yet to endorse Mackage, or any other label.\n\nThis could be explained by her attempts to live a more eco-friendly life. Fonda told The Washington Post she drives an electric car and is \"getting rid of plastics,\" though she's \"not quite vegan.\" (The Mackage coat is wool.)\n\n\"Maybe she does not want to create such a high demand for the coat that Mackage will have to produce more,\" Domoszlai-Lantner offered. \"There are so many clothes being produced and being wasted, thrown out, or in the case of Burberry, burnt .\"\n\nAnd so, for now, this mini-fashion mystery continues alongside Fonda's protest. As Domoszlai-Lantner put it, \"It's definitely a color that is eye-catching and makes a viewer stop, think, and possibly even act.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Anne Archer: Women in Hollywood Are Doomed Forever\n\nNews Director\n\nEDINBURGH - Half a century after Hollywood's liberal revolution, Oscar-nominated leading lady Anne Archer says she has never been more depressed about the prospects for women in the movie industry.\n\nThe 1960s and '70s were supposed to have been a watershed for equality, but Archer feels there is absolutely no prospect of women gaining equal status in the movie world. \"People have been asking that question for 40, 50 years and I haven't seen it happen,\" she said. \"Ten years ago I probably thought it would change, but now I'm more realistic.\"\n\nThe Fatal Attraction star is currently performing in a production at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland where she's playing Jane Fonda-the most outspoken activist and woman's rights campaigner in Hollywood history.  Despite the hard work of women like Fonda, Archer said, there had been no sea-change in attitudes within the industry. Serious parts for older actors are usually written for men; while women are predominantly relegated to roles for the young and the scantily-clad. \"The world market is young men, usually 18 to 25, that is your big market where they make the big money. And that is what everybody wants: to see young women naked in films,\" she said. \"A lot of women are major stars all through their 20s and 30s-it is always a big struggle for a woman when she hits 40.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArcher's experience was a little different, her Oscar nomination for Fatal Attraction and Golden Globe success in Short Cuts both came after her 40th birthday. For a decade in the 1990s she was a familiar face in the biggest Hollywood blockbusters, including Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger opposite Harrison Ford.\n\nRoles in major films have been less frequent since Rules of Engagement in 2000, however, and she has turned to independent movies, TV including It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , and latterly the stage. At Le Monde Hotel in central Edinburgh this week, she was still captivating at the age of 66. \"You know, I will always be creating art,\" she told The Daily Beast. \"I really don't care what the industry does; I will find my own way. And that is the way all artists have to think today.\"\n\nHer latest creation is the Trial of Jane Fonda , a truthful examination of the backlash against Fonda's Vietnam campaigning. Archer plays the lead in a ponderous but thoughtful one-act play penned by her husband, Terry Jastrow. Based on a real meeting between Fonda and six angry Vietnam vets in 1988, the actress tries to convince the men that the Hanoi Jane persona is overblown-she does not hate America and should not be considered a traitor.\n\nFonda tried in vain to convince Jarrow and Archer to ditch the project. \"She said, 'You have no idea what a hot potato this is, and the problems it would cause for me and the problems it would cause for you and what it stirs up,'\" Archer explained. And Archer has felt that first-hand. Her own brother, who was a Navy pilot in Vietnam, refused to come and see the show when they were workshopping it in Los Angeles. \"He doesn't like her,\" she said. \"He has that part of him that is a band of brothers with the military and they don't break ranks.\"\n\nArcher says the controversial defense of Fonda made it hard to sell the story as a movie screenplay; both sides of the argument are rehearsed during the show but it's clear where the writer's sympathy lies. \"My husband very much feels that she was the most effective anti-war activist-certainly in the Vietnam War and maybe in almost every war,\" Archer said.\n\nFonda was always willing to speak out even when it might be detrimental to her career. \"She got a lot of bad press,\" Archer said. \"She had the guts to stand up there and it was still tough, you know. I wouldn't have had the guts.\"\n\nDealing with bad press used to be one of the main preoccupations of her son, Tommy Davis, a former spokesman for Scientology and head of the church's Celebrity Centre International in Los Angeles until 2011. Davis now works as a senior vice president at Colony Capital, one of the world's largest real estate investment firms.\n\nArcher denied that he had left the prominent role in the church after a bust up with David Miscavige, the head of the church. \"There was no falling out. Not even remotely so. No, he is a Scientologist, he always has been and he always will be. As much as anyone. Absolutely,\" she said.\n\nAnd with a fixed smile and a determined look in her eye, she added: \"This article should not be about Scientology.\"\n\nThe Trial of Jane Fonda is at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh until August 24 .\n\nNews Director\n\nnico.hines@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Fonda, 80, recently spoke out about how \"inappropriate\" Kelly was to ask about the actress' plastic surgery on an early episode of NBC's Megyn Kelly Today . In response, Kelly used her Monday morning monologue to \"address [Fonda's] 'poor me' routine.\" She played a montage of various times Fonda spoke openly about her plastic surgery-adding that she has \"no regrets\" about asking it herself-and then pivoted to say that Fonda's \"name is synonymous with outrage.\" In an effort to call out the hypocrisy of her \"moral indignation,\" Kelly referred back to Fonda's radio broadcast \"shaming American troops,\" and calling the torture of U.S. prisoners of war \"understandable\" during the Vietnam War.\n\nMegyn Kelly responds to criticism from Jane Fonda saying that she has no regrets about asking about Fonda's plastic surgery.

The visit earned her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane,\" and she still regularly draws protestors to her public appearances. She made the comments at the Weinberg Center for the Arts in Frederick, Md., on Friday as about 50 veterans of the Vietnam War picketed the center. \"Those people out there... I'm a lightning rod,\" Fonda told the audience, according to The Frederick News-Post. \"This famous person goes and does something that looks like I'm against the troops, which wasn't true, but it looked that way, and I'm a convenient target. So I understand.\" She also said her time in North Vietnam as an \"incredible experience.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "'Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman' Speed Read\n\nThere have been nine biographies of Jane Fonda published, all written by men who were, Fonda is certain, threatened by her. Finally, in Patricia Bosworth's Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman , a woman tells her story. It's about time, considering that so many of Fonda's struggles and successes reflect those of an entire generation of women. Throughout her life, as the book makes clear, she has wrestled with self-doubt, obsessed over her looks, and sacrificed everything for men she loved. But what's most fascinating about Fonda is that in spite of all these issues, she is no less a fiercely independent and remarkable woman, making her something of a walking contradiction and, as Bosworth reveals, a natural-born chameleon.\n\nFor each of Fonda's myriad reinventions, from wanton sex symbol to political activist to trophy wife, she has started life anew. \"I live in the present,\" she declares to Bosworth, and her brother, Peter, agrees, saying, \"Jane has one version of her life, but you should get the others because they are equally interesting.\"\n\nCompiling stories from Jane's numerous lovers, friends, and enemies, Bosworth presents a new biography of one of the century's most legendary female icons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLady Jayne\n\nWhen Jayne Seymour Fonda was born on December 21, 1937, her father, Henry, obsessively snapped photos of his baby. \"There is a strong Fonda Look,\" the 32-year-old actor told The New Yorker. As a little girl, Jane was enamored of her father, but he was too self-involved to notice. Occasionally he would give her crumbs of attention, carrying her into their pool and teaching her to swim. \"I would bury my nose in his shoulder on the way down the steps and smell his skin,\" Jane recalled. \"He always had a delicious musky smell that I loved ... the smell of Man.\" She would crave that smell and the longing for attention she associated with it for the rest of her life.\n\nMommy Dearest\n\nFrances Seymour Fonda had wanted Jane to be a boy, since she already had a daughter from a previous marriage. She got her wish when Jane's brother, Peter, was born, though postpartum depression kept her in the hospital for weeks. When she finally came home, Frances would coo into Peter's crib as Jane stood scowling in the nursery corner. Frances' depression lingered in the form of manic mood swings, which worsened when [Henry] Fonda enlisted in the Army for two years. She would spend weeks in a state of frenzied activity and then hole up in her bedroom for days, shutting out the light and letting only Peter in. Jane would occasionally sneak into her room to find Frances staring wildly at her reflection in the mirror. She'd say to her daughter, \"Lady, if I gain any extra weight I'm going to cut it off with a knife!\"\n\nTragedy Strikes\n\nWhen Fonda returned from the Army, he was offered the lead in Broadway's Mr. Roberts and uprooted his family from Hollywood to Greenwich, Conn. A year later he dropped another bombshell: he was in love with another woman, and wanted a divorce. Frances put up a stoic front and wished him well, but Hank's rejection ultimately sent her over the edge.\n\nFrances was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1950. One day that spring, Jane and Peter were playing on the third floor of their house in Greenwich when Jane heard her mother's voice, \"Jane! Jane!\" She clutched Peter's arm, willing him to stay with her, but he slipped out of her grasp and left Jane alone upstairs. Her mother's cries would haunt Jane for life. Peter remembers hugging his mother that day, but he doesn't remember when she locked herself in her bathroom, emerging flushed and holding a porcelain box-a \"keepsake\" to bring back to the hospital. A razor was hidden inside, and a week later a nurse found Frances lying dead on the floor of her room in a pool of blood. She had slit her throat from ear to ear.\n\nJane Toys With Acting, Hank Takes Another Wife\n\nThe Fondas spent the summer of 1956 in a large rental house in Hyannis Port, Cape Cod, next to the Kennedy compound. Jane and her father acted together in a community production at the Dennis Playhouse, with Jane playing the role of the ingénue. Father watched daughter from offstage and thought, \"If that girl ever wants to do this professionally she'll make out all right.\" But he never praised her directly.\n\nWhen Henry married Afdera Franchetti, a 23-year-old countess, in 1957, Jane felt an urge to escape. She dropped out of Vassar to study painting in Paris, where she modeled for Vogue. Her father showed off the magazine backstage on Broadway, \"See how beautiful my daughter is!\" He loved how much she resembled him. When Jane returned to New York, her friend Susan Strasberg encouraged her to take lessons with her father, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg. Jane dismissed the idea. Susan didn't know her well enough at the time, but she would later realize that \"Jane always contradicts herself, saying the opposite of what she is thinking and feeling and wanting to do.\"\n\nDramatic Entrance\n\nAs Susan predicted, Jane would eventually study with Strasberg, who had coached stars like Marlon Brando and Marilyn Monroe. Jane was singled out for her talent in her Broadway debut, There Was a Little Girl . She immediately set her sights on being \"the best stage actress in the world.\" She was drawn to superlatives-she wanted to be the prettiest, thinnest, and most talented girl on Broadway. She purged to stay fit and popped Dexadrine before dance lessons. Acting became Jane's coping mechanism, a way of exorcising her demons that made her performances riveting. \"Jane quivers like a tuning fork,\" Kenneth Tynan wrote in The New Yorker. She was living with Andreas Voutsinas, her unofficial manager (and gay lover) at the time, who vividly recalls her bulimia spiraling out of control. \"I watched Jane consume three roast chickens, a couple of Sara Lee cheesecakes, a loaf of cheap white bread. She literally stuffed her face with food, gagging, then eating; then she rammed her knuckles down her throat and scraped the skin off.\"\n\nJane was constantly at the end of her emotional tether, which manifested brilliantly on stage. During her audition for Strasberg's elite Actors Studio, she strayed from the script in a dramatic scene from Butterfield 8. She turned away from the audience to smash a glass goblet, raising a shard to her throat. Andreas seized the glass from her hand, holding her in a long embrace until one of the judges yelled, \"Cut!\" Jane later told him about her mother's suicide. \"Yes, I think Jane considered killing herself,\" Andreas said. \"We slept in the same bed and she would talk in her sleep. She had many nightmares, and in nightmares her voice sounded almost subhuman, like another person. It was a hoarse, monster voice.\"\n\nSexual Reawakening\n\nWhen she wasn't acting, Jane modeled for famous photographers like Richard Avedon and Arthur Penn. She was morphing into a sex symbol, and producers wanted to capitalize on her look. While filming Joy House in Paris, Jane was introduced to the famous director Roger Vadim, who begged her to star in his sexual comedy of errors, Circle of Love. Vadim was a notorious Lothario whose mistresses had included Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve. Jane went to bed with him immediately. \"I thought my heart would burst,\" she said. \"What Vadim gave me when I was young was huge. Huge. He reawakened me sexually.\" She was also drawn to qualities in Vadim that reminded her of her father: his introversion, his moodiness, his seductive demeanor.\n\nMénage à Trois\n\nThree years into their marriage, Vadim and Jane began inviting other people into their bedroom. It was Vadim's idea to have un arrangement ; he confessed he'd had affairs since they got married, but insisted the other woman would never interfere with their love. The trysts reflected his philosophy of sexual freedom on which he built Jane's movie-star persona. She felt betrayed by his affairs but acquiesced to his arrangement , convinced that he \"validated\" her. The first time he brought home another woman, Jane \"threw myself into the threesome with the skill and enthusiasm of the actress that I am.\" Occasionally she would solicit women in attempt to reassert her power in the relationship. \"And the women do invariably fall in love with me,\" she would say, grinning.\n\nCross-Cultural Icon\n\nJane made some of her most iconic films over the next few years, including La Curée , Barefoot in the Park , and Barbarella . La Curée was Vadim's fantastical, erotic, over-the-top Technicolor film in which Jane plays a young woman experiencing the pleasures of sexual awakening. Barbarella was even more ahead of its time, based on a French comic strip about a spage-age adventuress whose mission to save the universe is punctuated by a series of bizarre sexual encounters. Vadim directed Barbarella and Jane was his marionette: she simulated multiple orgasms while perched atop a \"pleasure-making machine\"; she performed a strip tease; she crammed herself into a tiny cage where she was bait for killer wrens that were supposed to peck off her costume (when the birds wouldn't budge, Vadim covered Jane with birdseed).\n\nIn between Vadim's films, Jane starred opposite Robert Redford in Barefoot in the Park , which many critics hailed as the best performance of her career. The New York Times noted, \"Jane Fonda has managed to maintain two different public images simultaneously in France and the United States.\" In films like Barefoot , she \"sounds and dresses like the pretty roommate of the girl you dated in college, and everyone still thinks of her as Henry Fonda's daughter.\" In La Curée and Circle of Love , \"she undresses like Brigitte Bardot and everyone knows her as the latest wife of Roger Vadim.\"\n\nMetamorphosis\n\nOn the heels of Barbarella , Jane jumped at the opportunity to star in a film adaptation of Horace McCoy's 1935 novel They Shoot Horses, Don't They ? It was a Depression-era story and Jane's role nothing like the sex kitten archetype she had played too many times. She cut off her long, luscious blond hair, a defining feature of her image during her years with Vadim. There was little chemistry left between them, but he still coached Jane through the trauma of playing a suicidal woman. She felt possessed by Gloria's character even after they stopped shooting.\n\nThey Shoot Horses, Don't They? opened in mid-December to rave reviews. Newsweek called Jane's performance \"bold, admirable ... a wounded soul swathed in scar tissue.\" Meanwhile, Jane was already plotting her next act.\n\nActress Turned Activist\n\nIn the spring of 1970, not long after Vanessa Vadim was born, Jane left her baby in Vadim's care and took off to support the antiwar movement, throwing herself into any and every cause. At a University of Michigan student rally, she met Tom Hayden, one of the leftist founders of Students for a Democratic Society, and a future [California state] senator. His cold, taciturn manner reminded her of her father.\n\nIn 1971, Jane wowed critics as a no-nonsense call girl in Klute . She won her first Oscar for the film, which had a tremendous impact on women of her generation. Susan Brownmiller, the author of Against Our Will, recalled, \"Jane Fonda was the woman of our time up to a point. We all wanted to be like her-the liberated, sexually free woman. Everybody copied her shag hairdo, the miniskirts and boots, but she wasn't a feminist; she was still into depending on powerful men to find her identity.\" To wit: her relationship with Tom Hayden, whose political career would become her biggest cause.\n\nHanoi Jane\n\nIn the spring of 1972, the Vietnamese Committee for Solidarity with the American People invited Jane to visit Hanoi. She had planned to document the effects of the war in a film, and brought her video camera along while visiting ruined hospitals and schools. Before leaving the country, Jane went to see the air defense installation on the outskirts of Hanoi. She was escorted to an aircraft gun and told it was protecting the city from American airstrikes. Everyone laughed as Jane climbed atop the gun, unaware of a camera crew filming her every move. Flashes popped, at which point Jane realized how her skit to please the Vietnamese would look back home. The next day, \"Hanoi Jane\" was all over the American press. \"That two-minute lapse of sanity will haunt me until I die ...\" she said years later. \"I simply wasn't thinking about what I was doing, I was only feeling -innocent of what the photo implies.\" The White House pressed the Justice Department to bring treason charges against Jane. Though she was never convicted, she was vilified by the far Right for the next 30 years. By 2002, there were 7,000 hate websites dedicated to Jane Fonda.\n\nMaking History With Tom Hayden\n\nIn the early years of their marriage, Tom protected Jane from the backlash of her Hanoi trip. When Troy Hayden was born in July, 1973, the newlyweds were ecstatic. \"Troy was emblematic of all the things they were fighting for: a new order in America, a place where men and women could be respected equally,\" a friend recalled. Tom was the center of Jane's universe, but he was never comfortable with her fame. \"No one person deserves that much attention,\" he said in an interview with Barbara Walters. The couple would make headlines for the next 17 years, though they always began, \"Tom and Jane,\" because Hayden insisted his name go before his wife's. No one understood why Jane put up with his bullying, but she idolized him. \"I simply didn't think my ideas or feelings were as important or credible as his.\"\n\nDoing the Jane Fonda\n\nJane put all her energy into making money over the next couple of years for Tom's campaigns. She had taken dance lessons with the exercise tycoon Gilda Marx and decided to open her own studio, the Workout, where she would teach ballet, jazz, and other aerobic classes. By 1980, the Workout was making money and Jane's accountants encouraged her to turn it into a franchise. She would soon open two other studios in California, write a Workout book, and make Workout videos that would become as famous as her films. By the end of 1982, Jane's $20 million Workout chain was an emblem of America's new fitness craze. \"This was feminism in the age of narcissism,\" wrote Judith Warner. \"Jane Fonda was the great standard-bearer for this new self-empowerment ethic.\" But the Workout's success would be the undoing of Jane and Tom's marriage. He acted out by having multiple affairs. Jane swept them all under the rug until discovering he slept with another woman in their bed. She packed his belongings into plastic bags and threw them out the window.\n\nPower Couple\n\nJane's first date with billionaire media mogul Ted Turner confirmed her suspicions that he was trouble. He talked endlessly about himself throughout dinner, touting his political and social connections and his expanding media empire. Jane hadn't gotten in a word when he gushed at the end of the night, \"I'm smitten!\" As far as success stories go, Turner was on par with Jane. He had revolutionized the news industry and owned CNN, TNT, TBS, New Line Cinema, and the Atlanta Braves. There was no question that they had similar personalities, goals, and ambitions. They could make a great team-and for a while they did. By 1996, they had been happily married for nearly eight years, but she found herself slipping back into subservient wife mode. She was approaching 60 and still wrestling with her identity. When she asked her daughter if she would help make a short movie of her life as a birthday gift, Vanessa laughed half-heartedly. \"Why don't you just get a chameleon and let it crawl across the screen?\"\n\nIn the next year, Jane would become a grandmother and a born-again Christian. Turner wasn't happy. \"She was not a religious person,\" he said. \"That's a pretty big change for your wife of nine years to tell you.\" Turner was a smart guy, but had he missed the memo that Jane Fonda was inclined to act on impulses? That when she was passionate about something, no one could stop her from going after it at warp speed? When Ted and Jane finally separated, it was fairly amicable. Jane told friends they had mind-blowing sex right before splitting for good. Leave it to Jane Fonda to go out with a bang.\n\nGot a tip?

Even through five feet of concrete, they could still hear the roar of American bombs raining on parts of Hanoi.\n\nNearly four decades have passed since the so-called Christmas Bombings rocked parts of Vietnam's capital in December 1972. After the war ended three years later, the bunker was sealed and all but forgotten.\n\nIts exact location remained a mystery until this summer, when a worker's drill pierced its thick concrete roof during renovations of a poolside bar. Since then, workers have been excavating the flooded and low-ceilinged space. Not much has been found in the seven rooms: a wine bottle, a rusty paint can and a light bulb still in a socket. But a few tales remain, some involving famous guests.\n\n\"If these walls could talk, they would tell a lot of stories,\" says hotel general manager Kai Speth. He wants the bomb shelter brought back into the life of the hotel as a reminder of what the hotel and the town went through.\n\nThe North Vietnamese government used the French colonial-era hotel, a stately four-storey building in the shadow of Hanoi's opera house, to house foreign guests during the war.\n\nNguyen Thi Xuan Phuong, now 82, remembers staying in the bunker during the Christmas Bombings with anti-war activist Baez. On one of the 12 nights that B-52s pounded areas around the city, the lights went out, prompting a few foreigners to scream in the darkness.\n\n\"Can you sing a song?\" Phuong asked the young singer. \"We may not change the situation, but your songs may help calm people down.\" When Baez's voice rang out as someone plucked a guitar, the bunker was revitalised, Phuong recalls.\n\nOthers who sheltered there included war correspondents and American actress Jane Fonda, says Phuong, who worked for the government as a doctor assisting foreign guests.\n\nFonda's visit to enemy territory ignited fury at home. She criticised US policy on North Vietnamese radio and earned the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\" after posing for a photo atop an anti-aircraft gun, an incident that Fonda later said she regretted. Publicists for Baez and Fonda did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFrench entrepreneurs opened the Metropole in 1901, calling it the \"largest and best appointed hotel in Indo-China\". Over the years, it welcomed celebrities from Charlie Chaplin, who came in 1936 on his honeymoon, to Graham Greene, who wrote parts of his famous novel The Quiet American at the hotel.\n\nThe Metropole was renamed the Thong Nhat (Reunification) hotel after Vietnam gained its independence from France in 1954. But after communist forces won the Vietnam war in 1975, the hotel languished under state management as a reunified Vietnam struggled to recover from fighting that killed some 58,000 Americans and an estimated 3 million Vietnamese.\n\nIt wasn't until the early 1990s, after a French company assumed partial ownership, that the Metropole regained its earlier name and its place as one of the city's spots to see and be seen.\n\nToday, with Vietnam emerging as one of Asia's fastest growing economies, Hanoi's nouveaux riches roll up in Bentleys and Rolls-Royces and spend $70 per person on Sunday brunch. Upscale boutiques line its green-shuttered white facade, with electric-blue handbags selling at Hermès for $7,000 - nearly seven years' salary for the average Vietnamese. Mick Jagger, Angelina Jolie and Fidel Castro have all spent the night here.\n\nEven those who can't afford the $10 cocktails gravitate toward the city landmark. Every day soon-to-be Vietnamese brides in white silk and lace pose for photos outside its walls.\n\nDiscovery of the roughly 500sq ft bunker with its mildewed, mustard-coloured walls raises questions about how it will be preserved and who will be allowed to visit, especially since half of the hotel is indirectly owned by the government.\n\nProminent Vietnamese historian Duong Trung Quoc says it should be opened to the public. While the bunker primarily protected foreign guests, he says it could play an important role in illuminating Vietnam war history.\n\nBut Speth, the general manager, says he doesn't want mobs of tourists turning his five-star hotel into a south-east Asian Grand Central Station.\n\n\"I have an obligation to my guests to keep the Metropole luxurious and exclusive,\" he says. \"If I just leave it open, can you imagine? All of the tour guides of Hanoi would take everybody down there.\""

      "text": "Janeane Garofalo\n\nJaneane Garofalo disdains celebrities who stump for political causes, but that hasn't kept the versatile comedienne and actress from tackling political roles. In her newest film, Steal This Movie!, Garofalo stars as the wife of '60s radical Abbie Hoffman. The indie biopic - which chronicles the turbulent life of the yippie leader - gave Garofalo an opportunity to showcase both her dramatic talents and her lefty credentials. She spoke to us from a summer camp in Pennsylvania where she was shooting Wet Hot American Summer, a comedy.\n\nMother Jones: Steal This Movie! is your first overtly political film. What drew you to play Anita Hoffman?\n\nJaneane Garofalo: My politics are very liberal, so I love the era for obvious reasons. And I always had that image of Abbie Hoffman and the American flag shirt in my mind when I was younger. But it was also the role. I don't get the opportunity to play many principal dramatic parts. And I've never played somebody who's still alive - though Anita passed on last Thanksgiving. I figured it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, so I basically begged Robert [Greenwald], the director, to let me play it.\n\nMJ: Was he surprised that you were interested?\n\nJG: No, it was his labor of love. I think he'd be surprised if you weren't interested.\n\nMJ: You were a child during many of the events of this film. What do you remember about the '60s?\n\nJG: I was born in '64. I remember my brother playing a prank on me and claiming I had been drafted. I was so upset. I believed him. I remember the Chicago Seven trial. I remember Hanoi Jane. I remember Nixon addressing the country. And I remember that even though my parents were very young, they were very conservative. They weren't swept up in the '60s revolution at all.\n\nMJ: How did you reimmerse yourself in '60s counterculture?\n\nMJ: What about Abbie Hoffman inspires you the most?\n\nJG: Question authority - if you want a button issue. But the most important aspect of it is the civil rights work that Abbie and his cohorts did.\n\nMJ: Hoffman was one of the first people to really understand the concept of mass media and how to take advantage of it politically.\n\nJG: Abbie Hoffman welcomed any and all publicity. He would have killed to have his photo taken all the time and to be interviewed. So a lot of things he did were for ham reasons, and a lot of things he did were for the right reasons. He was a player. He worked it. People like Tom Hayden and Dave Dellinger - who was one of the Chicago Seven - they shunned that. Not all of them got along with Abbie very well for that reason.\n\nMJ: Do you enjoy the exposure that your celebrity affords you?\n\nJG: I actually don't enjoy being photographed or doing interviews - no offense. It makes me embarrassed to be under that kind of focus. I feel like, Who the fuck cares what I think?\n\nMJ: But as a public figure, you must have to choose whether to use your position to speak out about different issues.\n\nJG: I try to avoid it, because it actually has the opposite effect. I think people are very cynical with actors trying to tell them what to believe in, or lobbying for any kind of changing of government policy. Even I get cynical about it. Like, Why is Sharon Stone telling me this? And there's just something annoying about having Charlie Sheen tell me, \"It's your responsibility to vote,\" in an admonishing way on MTV.\n\nMJ: I always think of Richard Gere and Tibet.\n\nJG: Exactly. Mr. Enlightened. He's totally enlightened except that his girlfriends are still 20 years younger and in the modeling industry.\n\nMJ: One thing you have been outspoken about is the way Hollywood portrays women.\n\nJG: That's not grandstanding, because I live it. I am a victim of it. I'm talking about my personal, negative experiences.\n\nMJ: But you don't see yourself as a role model for the young women of America?\n\nJG: I don't see myself as a role model in any way. I would be flattered if anybody thought that I was, but I really don't think that's the case.\n\nMJ: Don't you think you're skirting the line a bit by doing such a political movie?\n\nJG: I'm comfortable doing a political film for the left. If somebody cast me in The Charlton Heston Story, I probably wouldn't do it.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nBefore going to bed at the US Naval Academy, a plebe shouts \"Good night!\" to the senior midshipman in the company, and the company commander answers \"Good night!\" in reply. A litany of good nights then passes down the chain of the company's command. At the end of this ritual courtesy, the plebe yells the final good night: \"Good night, Jane Fonda!\" and the entire company shouts its enthusiastic retort: \"Good night, bitch!\" Until that point, the performance has simply closed the day with a homage to hierarchy, with the lowest in the company, the plebe, showing deference to upperclass leaders. It reminds everyone of the rigid service academy structure, inherited from British boys' schools like Eton, in which upperclassmen dominate their juniors. The plebe plays the role of a child performing nightly valedictories to parents. But the final exchange, a unanimous curse of the former actress, former workout queen and former antiwar activist, serves quite a different end. The mock good night to Fonda reassures even the lowliest plebe of his insider status by expressing collective contempt for an outsider. According to an anonymous Naval Academy source, the ritual has been practiced by some but not all companies over the years, although in the past two years a few company officers have discouraged it. This article is adapted from Carol Burke's Camp All-American, Hanoi Jane, and the High and Tight: Gender, Folklore and Changing Military Culture . But why Jane Fonda? Why not a more contemporary adversary? Naval Academy midshipmen weren't even born when Fonda spoke out against having US troops in Vietnam; many of them don't even know who she is until they are introduced to the mythic Jane at the academy. Soldier folklore during the Vietnam War and for several years afterward made fun of Ho Chi Minh, his \"gooks\" and the notorious VC, but those figures of ridicule stepped aside in the first Gulf War, to be replaced by Saddam Hussein and his fellow Iraqis (\"ragheads\" in the jokes, songs and stories), and most recently by the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. All, that is, except Jane Fonda, who even as a grandmother in her mid-60s continues to attract a seemingly endless stream of abuse. More than thirty years after her trip to North Vietnam, veterans fill cyberspace with their resentment, and new recruits learn that being a real warrior and hating Jane Fonda are synonymous. Along with fresh recruits, both commissioned and enlisted, in other branches of the military, naval officers-in-training learn that just as military identity prescribes adulation for heroic military figures, it also encourages ridicule of despised civilians. In their plebe year, freshmen make the dramatic transition from civilian to military status, from home to barracks. They leave a world in which mothers have played a large part in their lives and enter an institution that remains largely male in numbers and traditions, despite opening its doors to women in the late 1970s. The good-night ritual articulates the need to repudiate the life left behind and to embrace a martial future. The Navy certainly has no monopoly on hatred of Jane Fonda; active-duty members and veterans of all the services freely express their disdain for the sex-kitten-turned-dressed-down-radical. Some of the more vitriolic veterans' websites provide forums in which contributors vent their anger toward the actress. As one vet writes, \"Jane Fonda should have been shot, and will never be forgiven.\" Another man posting to a hate-Fonda website describes his disappointment when he went to see the film Coming Home and her character wasn't killed. They rail at \"Hanoi Jane,\" belittle \"Jane Fondle\" and castigate her as a \"pinko slut\" who \"appeared nude in movies, smoked pot, smuggled drugs, used profanity publicly, and now, worst of all, was aiding and abetting the enemy during wartime.\" Most recently, hate-Fonda sites have displayed Photoshopped images designed to undermine the campaign of John Kerry by presenting the two side by side (along with real photos showing them several rows apart at an antiwar rally).

Referring to this apology, one vet states his anger simply, \"I will forgive Jane Fonda when the Jews forgive Hitler.\" These sites sport bumper stickers with Nuke Jane Fonda and Hanoi'd With Jane, along with the classic Vietnam Vets Are Not Fonda Jane. Internet critics also direct their hostility to Fonda in the form of virtual and real urinal targets. Some sites boast such targets available for download; others advertise them as stickers that can be purchased and affixed to public urinals. One of these targets features Fonda with legs lifted and spread apart (a promotional shot for one of her exercise videos). This image rests in the center of a bull's-eye. Superimposed over other images of the actress are cross-hairs, as if she were the sole enemy from an unfinished war. After explaining why he found Fonda's 1972 appearance in North Vietnam so repugnant, one vet recalled his pleasure at urinating on her face: \"[The] only addition I might add to these sentiments is to remember the satisfaction of relieving myself into the urinal at some airbase or another where 'zaps' of Hanoi Jane's face had been applied.\" One urinal target reproduces the notorious 1972 photograph taken during Fonda's visit to North Vietnam: helmeted, smiling, seated at an antiaircraft gun (Fonda told O, the Oprah Magazine that she'd \"go to my grave\" regretting that photograph). If the urinal targets offer the fantasy of retributive justice, fictionalized accounts of Fonda's 1972 visit with American POWs in North Vietnam charge her with conspiracy. In these word-of-mouth and Internet stories, which circulate widely among active-duty soldiers and veterans, the punishment inflicted on uncooperative POWs is linked to Fonda's presence. An oft-told variant of the torture legend depicts a single prisoner (generally considered to be POW Jerry Driscoll) who is forced to meet with Fonda and registers his defiance by spitting on the star: Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJs, he was ordered to describe for a visiting American \"Peace Activist\" the \"lenient and humane treatment\" he'd received. He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed and dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp Commandant's feet, which sent that officer berserk. In 1978, the AF Col. still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying days) from the Vietnamese Col.'s frenzied application of a wooden baton. This story is pure fiction (see links for this and the following excerpts at www.thenation.com ). The prisoners to whom it is attributed, although no fans of Fonda, have flatly denied that it happened. The most popular of all these legends is by far the most dramatic. As recounted on another anti-Fonda site: He [Larry Carrigan] spent 6 years in the \"Hilton\"-the first three of which he was \"missing in action.\" His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned/fed/clothed routine in preparation for a \"peace delegation\" visit. They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his [social security number] on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: \"Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?\" and \"Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?\" Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper. She took them all without missing a beat. At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge...and handed him the little pile of papers. Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Col Carrigan was almost number four. Such stories travel from vet to vet and soldier to soldier by word of mouth, across the back fence into the cyber fields, and even into print. One popular biography of Fonda recounts them as claims to be taken seriously, as do the Washington Times and William F. Buckley Jr., in a syndicated November 1999 article. Vietnam POWs have tried to debunk the stories falsely attributed to them. Mike McGrath, the president of NAM-POWs and a prisoner from 1967 to 1973, has denounced them. Speaking for specific POWs named in the stories, McGrath has tried to set the record straight: They had nothing to do with the article attributed to them. They ask that we get their names off that bunch of crap. Tonight I talked with Larry Carrigan. He asked that we get his name off all that crap as well. He never left a room to talk to anyone like that. No torture or beatings to see Fonda. He was living with Bud Day, John McCain and a bunch of hard-nosed resisters during the Fonda visit...lots of witnesses if you want to question him (or them). Larry was never near Jane. There were never any POWs killed on account of Jane. (Did anyone ever provide a name of one of these tortured fellows?) That story about the notes has a nice theatric touch, but no such thing ever happened. The only ones who met with Jane willingly, to my knowledge, were CDR Gene Wilber and LCOL Ed Miller. One NAM-POW was forced to go before the Fonda delegation. And I think that was only to sit at a table for a photo opportunity. I doubt he ever got a chance to talk to her, let alone slip her a note. To my knowledge, the worst that happened to the rest of us was that we had to listen to the camp radio (Radio Hanoi and Hanoi Hannah) with the Fonda propaganda. It pissed us off, but I doubt you can call that \"torture.\" So, if you get a chance to SHUT THIS STORY DOWN to the groups who are forwarding it, PLEASE DO SO. Despite the efforts of McGrath and others to stanch the flow of such legends, they continue to circulate, because they satisfy their tellers and audience as a protest against one of the most outspoken critics of the military. But Fonda is not just any antiwar activist; she is a civilian woman-\"civilian\" and \"woman\" being terms that in military culture tend to collapse into each other. For the Vietnam War soldier, more than for his counterparts in any previous war, the lines between civilian and military became increasingly ambiguous. The Vietnamese who appeared one day as harmless civilians (women, children and the elderly) might on another day behave as agents of the enemy. Soldier songs, chants, jokes and stories gave voice to the soldiers' fear of a civilian population capable of transforming itself into the dreaded enemy. A version of that uncanny transformation took place stateside as well. Civilians at home, who in past wars had shown steadfast support and offered a grateful welcome to the returning soldier, became increasingly outspoken in protesting the war America had sent its soldiers to wage. These protesters grew loud in their denunciation of napalm and carpet bombing, which targeted civilians, they claimed, rather than enemy troops. They called soldiers \"baby killers\" and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\" At the end of their tour, soldiers often returned to condemnation rather than congratulations. The military has traditionally done an effective job of transforming the fresh recruit into a government-issue soldier capable of executing violence on command. By contrast, it has done very little to reverse the process and return the soldier to civilian life. Historically, the civilian population has assumed that role by ceremoniously welcoming home its soldiers with an acknowledgment of their suffering, thereby absolving the individual soldier of personal responsibility for acts performed in the name of the nation. When the civilian population refuses to accept this burden, it falls heavily on each soldier to handle it as best he can. Thus we saw a proliferation of \"rap groups,\" group therapy sessions in which vets sought the confidence of fellow participants, fellow sufferers, after the Vietnam War. In a war that featured few heroes, prisoners of war, whose sacrifice could not be challenged, enjoyed a special status. So it is not surprising that it was stories of POWs and their fictional encounters with Jane Fonda that enjoyed such a long life and such wide circulation among members of the military. Those stories rebuke the civilian who inflicts greater pain on the war's unambiguous victims. In a war in which the enemy was not clearly defined, it sometimes seemed to the unappreciated soldier that the real enemies might be back home. And in an important sense, Vietnam was a war of America against itself. The choice of Jane Fonda as the woman soldiers love to hate didn't arise solely from her highly publicized antiwar stance. Other American women were just as active in the antiwar movement. Denise Levertov, like Fonda, made a trip to North Vietnam to protest the war, and Joan Baez was every bit as much a staunch critic as Fonda. No, Fonda engendered such anger in part because she had once stood for the girl every soldier had known at home. Vietnam-era soldiers had come to know her first as the cute ingenue of Tall Story and as the daughter of a famous and admired Hollywood star and then as the sex kitten Barbarella, always ready and willing to please. Within three years of playing Barbarella, Fonda was appearing regularly in prime-time news clips condemning US involvement in Vietnam. She and other actors and writers (Donald Sutherland, Dick Gregory and Fred Gardner among them) performed in shows that satirized the military and its role in Vietnam in coffeehouses near US bases. They intended their traveling review to be an antidote to the performances of entertainers who traveled from base to base to lend their support to the troops. Those who condemned Fonda were not just disturbed by her efforts to win the hearts and minds of US servicemen through these performances and through her longtime support for Vietnam Veterans Against the War; nor was it her support for the North Vietnamese propaganda campaign that made them so angry. They saw in Fonda the American female uncannily, as if by sabotage, transformed into an enemy agent. The figure of a woman who appears to be one thing but turns out to be something more sinister or monstrous inhabits centuries of folklore. She makes her way into soldier lore as the apparently innocent but seductive foreign woman who turns out to be extremely menacing-for example, in the legends of pretty and inviting Vietnamese women who secretly laced their vaginas with broken glass, fishhooks or barbed wire in order to castrate GIs. While touring North Vietnam, Fonda attended performances of theater and dance, spoke with \"the blushing militia girls,\" retreated to a bomb shelter when the shells began to drop and voiced her strong opposition to the war on North Vietnamese radio. The ever available, playful Barbarella had become the American soldier's nightmare-Hanoi Jane. The Jane Fonda stories, the urinal targets and even the goodnight ritual at the Naval Academy function in military culture to stabilize and punish the dangerous female. Fonda is seen as the ultimate shapeshifter, a woman who has remade herself many times over, as ingenue, sex kitten, antiwar activist, exercise queen, wife of Ted Turner and born-again Baptist. In the face of this fluid civilian female, the military traditionally promises a one-way transformation from civilian to soldier, from boy to man, a process intended to fix a new identity, one that will travel with the soldier long after he has left active service. During the rapid troop rotations, massive antiwar demonstrations and challenges to traditional gender roles that characterized the period of the Vietnam War, when a majority of soldiers didn't see combat, the military failed to make good on its promise of transformation for many who served. As a result, they found themselves neither the innocents they were before going off to war nor the respected warriors their fathers had become when they returned from World War II. For Fonda, there is no amount of self-transformation she can undertake that will save her from being cast in legend as the figure of the seductive woman who turns out to be a snake. It's the oldest story in the world.\n\nBut why Jane Fonda? Why not a more contemporary adversary? Naval Academy midshipmen weren't even born when Fonda spoke out against having US troops in Vietnam; many of them don't even know who she is until they are introduced to the mythic Jane at the academy. Soldier folklore during the Vietnam War and for several years afterward made fun of Ho Chi Minh, his \"gooks\" and the notorious VC, but those figures of ridicule stepped aside in the first Gulf War, to be replaced by Saddam Hussein and his fellow Iraqis (\"ragheads\" in the jokes, songs and stories), and most recently by the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.

Referring to this apology, one vet states his anger simply, \"I will forgive Jane Fonda when the Jews forgive Hitler.\" These sites sport bumper stickers with Nuke Jane Fonda and Hanoi'd With Jane, along with the classic Vietnam Vets Are Not Fonda Jane. Internet critics also direct their hostility to Fonda in the form of virtual and real urinal targets. Some sites boast such targets available for download; others advertise them as stickers that can be purchased and affixed to public urinals. One of these targets features Fonda with legs lifted and spread apart (a promotional shot for one of her exercise videos). This image rests in the center of a bull's-eye. Superimposed over other images of the actress are cross-hairs, as if she were the sole enemy from an unfinished war. After explaining why he found Fonda's 1972 appearance in North Vietnam so repugnant, one vet recalled his pleasure at urinating on her face: \"[The] only addition I might add to these sentiments is to remember the satisfaction of relieving myself into the urinal at some airbase or another where 'zaps' of Hanoi Jane's face had been applied.\" One urinal target reproduces the notorious 1972 photograph taken during Fonda's visit to North Vietnam: helmeted, smiling, seated at an antiaircraft gun (Fonda told O, the Oprah Magazine that she'd \"go to my grave\" regretting that photograph). If the urinal targets offer the fantasy of retributive justice, fictionalized accounts of Fonda's 1972 visit with American POWs in North Vietnam charge her with conspiracy. In these word-of-mouth and Internet stories, which circulate widely among active-duty soldiers and veterans, the punishment inflicted on uncooperative POWs is linked to Fonda's presence. An oft-told variant of the torture legend depicts a single prisoner (generally considered to be POW Jerry Driscoll) who is forced to meet with Fonda and registers his defiance by spitting on the star: Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJs, he was ordered to describe for a visiting American \"Peace Activist\" the \"lenient and humane treatment\" he'd received. He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed and dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp Commandant's feet, which sent that officer berserk. In 1978, the AF Col. still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying days) from the Vietnamese Col.'s frenzied application of a wooden baton. This story is pure fiction (see links for this and the following excerpts at www.thenation.com ). The prisoners to whom it is attributed, although no fans of Fonda, have flatly denied that it happened. The most popular of all these legends is by far the most dramatic. As recounted on another anti-Fonda site: He [Larry Carrigan] spent 6 years in the \"Hilton\"-the first three of which he was \"missing in action.\" His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned/fed/clothed routine in preparation for a \"peace delegation\" visit. They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his [social security number] on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: \"Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?\" and \"Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?\" Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper. She took them all without missing a beat. At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge...and handed him the little pile of papers. Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Col Carrigan was almost number four. Such stories travel from vet to vet and soldier to soldier by word of mouth, across the back fence into the cyber fields, and even into print. One popular biography of Fonda recounts them as claims to be taken seriously, as do the Washington Times and William F. Buckley Jr., in a syndicated November 1999 article. Vietnam POWs have tried to debunk the stories falsely attributed to them. Mike McGrath, the president of NAM-POWs and a prisoner from 1967 to 1973, has denounced them. Speaking for specific POWs named in the stories, McGrath has tried to set the record straight: They had nothing to do with the article attributed to them. They ask that we get their names off that bunch of crap. Tonight I talked with Larry Carrigan. He asked that we get his name off all that crap as well. He never left a room to talk to anyone like that. No torture or beatings to see Fonda. He was living with Bud Day, John McCain and a bunch of hard-nosed resisters during the Fonda visit...lots of witnesses if you want to question him (or them). Larry was never near Jane. There were never any POWs killed on account of Jane. (Did anyone ever provide a name of one of these tortured fellows?) That story about the notes has a nice theatric touch, but no such thing ever happened. The only ones who met with Jane willingly, to my knowledge, were CDR Gene Wilber and LCOL Ed Miller. One NAM-POW was forced to go before the Fonda delegation. And I think that was only to sit at a table for a photo opportunity. I doubt he ever got a chance to talk to her, let alone slip her a note. To my knowledge, the worst that happened to the rest of us was that we had to listen to the camp radio (Radio Hanoi and Hanoi Hannah) with the Fonda propaganda. It pissed us off, but I doubt you can call that \"torture.\" So, if you get a chance to SHUT THIS STORY DOWN to the groups who are forwarding it, PLEASE DO SO. Despite the efforts of McGrath and others to stanch the flow of such legends, they continue to circulate, because they satisfy their tellers and audience as a protest against one of the most outspoken critics of the military. But Fonda is not just any antiwar activist; she is a civilian woman-\"civilian\" and \"woman\" being terms that in military culture tend to collapse into each other. For the Vietnam War soldier, more than for his counterparts in any previous war, the lines between civilian and military became increasingly ambiguous. The Vietnamese who appeared one day as harmless civilians (women, children and the elderly) might on another day behave as agents of the enemy. Soldier songs, chants, jokes and stories gave voice to the soldiers' fear of a civilian population capable of transforming itself into the dreaded enemy. A version of that uncanny transformation took place stateside as well. Civilians at home, who in past wars had shown steadfast support and offered a grateful welcome to the returning soldier, became increasingly outspoken in protesting the war America had sent its soldiers to wage. These protesters grew loud in their denunciation of napalm and carpet bombing, which targeted civilians, they claimed, rather than enemy troops. They called soldiers \"baby killers\" and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\" At the end of their tour, soldiers often returned to condemnation rather than congratulations. The military has traditionally done an effective job of transforming the fresh recruit into a government-issue soldier capable of executing violence on command. By contrast, it has done very little to reverse the process and return the soldier to civilian life. Historically, the civilian population has assumed that role by ceremoniously welcoming home its soldiers with an acknowledgment of their suffering, thereby absolving the individual soldier of personal responsibility for acts performed in the name of the nation. When the civilian population refuses to accept this burden, it falls heavily on each soldier to handle it as best he can. Thus we saw a proliferation of \"rap groups,\" group therapy sessions in which vets sought the confidence of fellow participants, fellow sufferers, after the Vietnam War. In a war that featured few heroes, prisoners of war, whose sacrifice could not be challenged, enjoyed a special status. So it is not surprising that it was stories of POWs and their fictional encounters with Jane Fonda that enjoyed such a long life and such wide circulation among members of the military. Those stories rebuke the civilian who inflicts greater pain on the war's unambiguous victims. In a war in which the enemy was not clearly defined, it sometimes seemed to the unappreciated soldier that the real enemies might be back home. And in an important sense, Vietnam was a war of America against itself. The choice of Jane Fonda as the woman soldiers love to hate didn't arise solely from her highly publicized antiwar stance. Other American women were just as active in the antiwar movement. Denise Levertov, like Fonda, made a trip to North Vietnam to protest the war, and Joan Baez was every bit as much a staunch critic as Fonda. No, Fonda engendered such anger in part because she had once stood for the girl every soldier had known at home. Vietnam-era soldiers had come to know her first as the cute ingenue of Tall Story and as the daughter of a famous and admired Hollywood star and then as the sex kitten Barbarella, always ready and willing to please. Within three years of playing Barbarella, Fonda was appearing regularly in prime-time news clips condemning US involvement in Vietnam. She and other actors and writers (Donald Sutherland, Dick Gregory and Fred Gardner among them) performed in shows that satirized the military and its role in Vietnam in coffeehouses near US bases. They intended their traveling review to be an antidote to the performances of entertainers who traveled from base to base to lend their support to the troops. Those who condemned Fonda were not just disturbed by her efforts to win the hearts and minds of US servicemen through these performances and through her longtime support for Vietnam Veterans Against the War; nor was it her support for the North Vietnamese propaganda campaign that made them so angry. They saw in Fonda the American female uncannily, as if by sabotage, transformed into an enemy agent. The figure of a woman who appears to be one thing but turns out to be something more sinister or monstrous inhabits centuries of folklore. She makes her way into soldier lore as the apparently innocent but seductive foreign woman who turns out to be extremely menacing-for example, in the legends of pretty and inviting Vietnamese women who secretly laced their vaginas with broken glass, fishhooks or barbed wire in order to castrate GIs. While touring North Vietnam, Fonda attended performances of theater and dance, spoke with \"the blushing militia girls,\" retreated to a bomb shelter when the shells began to drop and voiced her strong opposition to the war on North Vietnamese radio. The ever available, playful Barbarella had become the American soldier's nightmare-Hanoi Jane. The Jane Fonda stories, the urinal targets and even the goodnight ritual at the Naval Academy function in military culture to stabilize and punish the dangerous female. Fonda is seen as the ultimate shapeshifter, a woman who has remade herself many times over, as ingenue, sex kitten, antiwar activist, exercise queen, wife of Ted Turner and born-again Baptist. In the face of this fluid civilian female, the military traditionally promises a one-way transformation from civilian to soldier, from boy to man, a process intended to fix a new identity, one that will travel with the soldier long after he has left active service. During the rapid troop rotations, massive antiwar demonstrations and challenges to traditional gender roles that characterized the period of the Vietnam War, when a majority of soldiers didn't see combat, the military failed to make good on its promise of transformation for many who served. As a result, they found themselves neither the innocents they were before going off to war nor the respected warriors their fathers had become when they returned from World War II. For Fonda, there is no amount of self-transformation she can undertake that will save her from being cast in legend as the figure of the seductive woman who turns out to be a snake. It's the oldest story in the world.\n\nAlong with fresh recruits, both commissioned and enlisted, in other branches of the military, naval officers-in-training learn that just as military identity prescribes adulation for heroic military figures, it also encourages ridicule of despised civilians. In their plebe year, freshmen make the dramatic transition from civilian to military status, from home to barracks. They leave a world in which mothers have played a large part in their lives and enter an institution that remains largely male in numbers and traditions, despite opening its doors to women in the late 1970s. The good-night ritual articulates the need to repudiate the life left behind and to embrace a martial future. The Navy certainly has no monopoly on hatred of Jane Fonda; active-duty members and veterans of all the services freely express their disdain for the sex-kitten-turned-dressed-down-radical. Some of the more vitriolic veterans' websites provide forums in which contributors vent their anger toward the actress. As one vet writes, \"Jane Fonda should have been shot, and will never be forgiven.\" Another man posting to a hate-Fonda website describes his disappointment when he went to see the film Coming Home and her character wasn't killed. They rail at \"Hanoi Jane,\" belittle \"Jane Fondle\" and castigate her as a \"pinko slut\" who \"appeared nude in movies, smoked pot, smuggled drugs, used profanity publicly, and now, worst of all, was aiding and abetting the enemy during wartime.\" Most recently, hate-Fonda sites have displayed Photoshopped images designed to undermine the campaign of John Kerry by presenting the two side by side (along with real photos showing them several rows apart at an antiwar rally).

That story about the notes has a nice theatric touch, but no such thing ever happened. The only ones who met with Jane willingly, to my knowledge, were CDR Gene Wilber and LCOL Ed Miller. One NAM-POW was forced to go before the Fonda delegation. And I think that was only to sit at a table for a photo opportunity. I doubt he ever got a chance to talk to her, let alone slip her a note. To my knowledge, the worst that happened to the rest of us was that we had to listen to the camp radio (Radio Hanoi and Hanoi Hannah) with the Fonda propaganda. It pissed us off, but I doubt you can call that \"torture.\" So, if you get a chance to SHUT THIS STORY DOWN to the groups who are forwarding it, PLEASE DO SO. Despite the efforts of McGrath and others to stanch the flow of such legends, they continue to circulate, because they satisfy their tellers and audience as a protest against one of the most outspoken critics of the military. But Fonda is not just any antiwar activist; she is a civilian woman-\"civilian\" and \"woman\" being terms that in military culture tend to collapse into each other. For the Vietnam War soldier, more than for his counterparts in any previous war, the lines between civilian and military became increasingly ambiguous. The Vietnamese who appeared one day as harmless civilians (women, children and the elderly) might on another day behave as agents of the enemy. Soldier songs, chants, jokes and stories gave voice to the soldiers' fear of a civilian population capable of transforming itself into the dreaded enemy. A version of that uncanny transformation took place stateside as well. Civilians at home, who in past wars had shown steadfast support and offered a grateful welcome to the returning soldier, became increasingly outspoken in protesting the war America had sent its soldiers to wage. These protesters grew loud in their denunciation of napalm and carpet bombing, which targeted civilians, they claimed, rather than enemy troops. They called soldiers \"baby killers\" and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\" At the end of their tour, soldiers often returned to condemnation rather than congratulations. The military has traditionally done an effective job of transforming the fresh recruit into a government-issue soldier capable of executing violence on command. By contrast, it has done very little to reverse the process and return the soldier to civilian life. Historically, the civilian population has assumed that role by ceremoniously welcoming home its soldiers with an acknowledgment of their suffering, thereby absolving the individual soldier of personal responsibility for acts performed in the name of the nation. When the civilian population refuses to accept this burden, it falls heavily on each soldier to handle it as best he can. Thus we saw a proliferation of \"rap groups,\" group therapy sessions in which vets sought the confidence of fellow participants, fellow sufferers, after the Vietnam War. In a war that featured few heroes, prisoners of war, whose sacrifice could not be challenged, enjoyed a special status. So it is not surprising that it was stories of POWs and their fictional encounters with Jane Fonda that enjoyed such a long life and such wide circulation among members of the military. Those stories rebuke the civilian who inflicts greater pain on the war's unambiguous victims. In a war in which the enemy was not clearly defined, it sometimes seemed to the unappreciated soldier that the real enemies might be back home. And in an important sense, Vietnam was a war of America against itself. The choice of Jane Fonda as the woman soldiers love to hate didn't arise solely from her highly publicized antiwar stance. Other American women were just as active in the antiwar movement. Denise Levertov, like Fonda, made a trip to North Vietnam to protest the war, and Joan Baez was every bit as much a staunch critic as Fonda. No, Fonda engendered such anger in part because she had once stood for the girl every soldier had known at home. Vietnam-era soldiers had come to know her first as the cute ingenue of Tall Story and as the daughter of a famous and admired Hollywood star and then as the sex kitten Barbarella, always ready and willing to please. Within three years of playing Barbarella, Fonda was appearing regularly in prime-time news clips condemning US involvement in Vietnam. She and other actors and writers (Donald Sutherland, Dick Gregory and Fred Gardner among them) performed in shows that satirized the military and its role in Vietnam in coffeehouses near US bases. They intended their traveling review to be an antidote to the performances of entertainers who traveled from base to base to lend their support to the troops. Those who condemned Fonda were not just disturbed by her efforts to win the hearts and minds of US servicemen through these performances and through her longtime support for Vietnam Veterans Against the War; nor was it her support for the North Vietnamese propaganda campaign that made them so angry. They saw in Fonda the American female uncannily, as if by sabotage, transformed into an enemy agent. The figure of a woman who appears to be one thing but turns out to be something more sinister or monstrous inhabits centuries of folklore. She makes her way into soldier lore as the apparently innocent but seductive foreign woman who turns out to be extremely menacing-for example, in the legends of pretty and inviting Vietnamese women who secretly laced their vaginas with broken glass, fishhooks or barbed wire in order to castrate GIs. While touring North Vietnam, Fonda attended performances of theater and dance, spoke with \"the blushing militia girls,\" retreated to a bomb shelter when the shells began to drop and voiced her strong opposition to the war on North Vietnamese radio. The ever available, playful Barbarella had become the American soldier's nightmare-Hanoi Jane. The Jane Fonda stories, the urinal targets and even the goodnight ritual at the Naval Academy function in military culture to stabilize and punish the dangerous female. Fonda is seen as the ultimate shapeshifter, a woman who has remade herself many times over, as ingenue, sex kitten, antiwar activist, exercise queen, wife of Ted Turner and born-again Baptist. In the face of this fluid civilian female, the military traditionally promises a one-way transformation from civilian to soldier, from boy to man, a process intended to fix a new identity, one that will travel with the soldier long after he has left active service. During the rapid troop rotations, massive antiwar demonstrations and challenges to traditional gender roles that characterized the period of the Vietnam War, when a majority of soldiers didn't see combat, the military failed to make good on its promise of transformation for many who served. As a result, they found themselves neither the innocents they were before going off to war nor the respected warriors their fathers had become when they returned from World War II. For Fonda, there is no amount of self-transformation she can undertake that will save her from being cast in legend as the figure of the seductive woman who turns out to be a snake. It's the oldest story in the world.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda defended her opposition to the war but apologized to vets and their families for the \"thoughtless\" and \"careless\" things she might have said and done in her political enthusiasm. Referring to this apology, one vet states his anger simply, \"I will forgive Jane Fonda when the Jews forgive Hitler.\" These sites sport bumper stickers with Nuke Jane Fonda and Hanoi'd With Jane, along with the classic Vietnam Vets Are Not Fonda Jane. Internet critics also direct their hostility to Fonda in the form of virtual and real urinal targets. Some sites boast such targets available for download; others advertise them as stickers that can be purchased and affixed to public urinals. One of these targets features Fonda with legs lifted and spread apart (a promotional shot for one of her exercise videos). This image rests in the center of a bull's-eye. Superimposed over other images of the actress are cross-hairs, as if she were the sole enemy from an unfinished war. After explaining why he found Fonda's 1972 appearance in North Vietnam so repugnant, one vet recalled his pleasure at urinating on her face: \"[The] only addition I might add to these sentiments is to remember the satisfaction of relieving myself into the urinal at some airbase or another where 'zaps' of Hanoi Jane's face had been applied.\" One urinal target reproduces the notorious 1972 photograph taken during Fonda's visit to North Vietnam: helmeted, smiling, seated at an antiaircraft gun (Fonda told O, the Oprah Magazine that she'd \"go to my grave\" regretting that photograph). If the urinal targets offer the fantasy of retributive justice, fictionalized accounts of Fonda's 1972 visit with American POWs in North Vietnam charge her with conspiracy. In these word-of-mouth and Internet stories, which circulate widely among active-duty soldiers and veterans, the punishment inflicted on uncooperative POWs is linked to Fonda's presence. An oft-told variant of the torture legend depicts a single prisoner (generally considered to be POW Jerry Driscoll) who is forced to meet with Fonda and registers his defiance by spitting on the star: Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJs, he was ordered to describe for a visiting American \"Peace Activist\" the \"lenient and humane treatment\" he'd received. He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed and dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp Commandant's feet, which sent that officer berserk. In 1978, the AF Col. still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying days) from the Vietnamese Col.'s frenzied application of a wooden baton. This story is pure fiction (see links for this and the following excerpts at www.thenation.com ). The prisoners to whom it is attributed, although no fans of Fonda, have flatly denied that it happened. The most popular of all these legends is by far the most dramatic. As recounted on another anti-Fonda site: He [Larry Carrigan] spent 6 years in the \"Hilton\"-the first three of which he was \"missing in action.\" His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned/fed/clothed routine in preparation for a \"peace delegation\" visit. They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his [social security number] on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: \"Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?\" and \"Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?\" Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper. She took them all without missing a beat. At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge...and handed him the little pile of papers. Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Col Carrigan was almost number four. Such stories travel from vet to vet and soldier to soldier by word of mouth, across the back fence into the cyber fields, and even into print. One popular biography of Fonda recounts them as claims to be taken seriously, as do the Washington Times and William F. Buckley Jr., in a syndicated November 1999 article. Vietnam POWs have tried to debunk the stories falsely attributed to them. Mike McGrath, the president of NAM-POWs and a prisoner from 1967 to 1973, has denounced them. Speaking for specific POWs named in the stories, McGrath has tried to set the record straight: They had nothing to do with the article attributed to them. They ask that we get their names off that bunch of crap. Tonight I talked with Larry Carrigan. He asked that we get his name off all that crap as well. He never left a room to talk to anyone like that. No torture or beatings to see Fonda. He was living with Bud Day, John McCain and a bunch of hard-nosed resisters during the Fonda visit...lots of witnesses if you want to question him (or them). Larry was never near Jane.

For the Vietnam War soldier, more than for his counterparts in any previous war, the lines between civilian and military became increasingly ambiguous. The Vietnamese who appeared one day as harmless civilians (women, children and the elderly) might on another day behave as agents of the enemy. Soldier songs, chants, jokes and stories gave voice to the soldiers' fear of a civilian population capable of transforming itself into the dreaded enemy. A version of that uncanny transformation took place stateside as well. Civilians at home, who in past wars had shown steadfast support and offered a grateful welcome to the returning soldier, became increasingly outspoken in protesting the war America had sent its soldiers to wage. These protesters grew loud in their denunciation of napalm and carpet bombing, which targeted civilians, they claimed, rather than enemy troops. They called soldiers \"baby killers\" and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\" At the end of their tour, soldiers often returned to condemnation rather than congratulations. The military has traditionally done an effective job of transforming the fresh recruit into a government-issue soldier capable of executing violence on command. By contrast, it has done very little to reverse the process and return the soldier to civilian life. Historically, the civilian population has assumed that role by ceremoniously welcoming home its soldiers with an acknowledgment of their suffering, thereby absolving the individual soldier of personal responsibility for acts performed in the name of the nation. When the civilian population refuses to accept this burden, it falls heavily on each soldier to handle it as best he can. Thus we saw a proliferation of \"rap groups,\" group therapy sessions in which vets sought the confidence of fellow participants, fellow sufferers, after the Vietnam War. In a war that featured few heroes, prisoners of war, whose sacrifice could not be challenged, enjoyed a special status. So it is not surprising that it was stories of POWs and their fictional encounters with Jane Fonda that enjoyed such a long life and such wide circulation among members of the military. Those stories rebuke the civilian who inflicts greater pain on the war's unambiguous victims. In a war in which the enemy was not clearly defined, it sometimes seemed to the unappreciated soldier that the real enemies might be back home. And in an important sense, Vietnam was a war of America against itself. The choice of Jane Fonda as the woman soldiers love to hate didn't arise solely from her highly publicized antiwar stance. Other American women were just as active in the antiwar movement. Denise Levertov, like Fonda, made a trip to North Vietnam to protest the war, and Joan Baez was every bit as much a staunch critic as Fonda. No, Fonda engendered such anger in part because she had once stood for the girl every soldier had known at home. Vietnam-era soldiers had come to know her first as the cute ingenue of Tall Story and as the daughter of a famous and admired Hollywood star and then as the sex kitten Barbarella, always ready and willing to please. Within three years of playing Barbarella, Fonda was appearing regularly in prime-time news clips condemning US involvement in Vietnam. She and other actors and writers (Donald Sutherland, Dick Gregory and Fred Gardner among them) performed in shows that satirized the military and its role in Vietnam in coffeehouses near US bases. They intended their traveling review to be an antidote to the performances of entertainers who traveled from base to base to lend their support to the troops. Those who condemned Fonda were not just disturbed by her efforts to win the hearts and minds of US servicemen through these performances and through her longtime support for Vietnam Veterans Against the War; nor was it her support for the North Vietnamese propaganda campaign that made them so angry. They saw in Fonda the American female uncannily, as if by sabotage, transformed into an enemy agent. The figure of a woman who appears to be one thing but turns out to be something more sinister or monstrous inhabits centuries of folklore. She makes her way into soldier lore as the apparently innocent but seductive foreign woman who turns out to be extremely menacing-for example, in the legends of pretty and inviting Vietnamese women who secretly laced their vaginas with broken glass, fishhooks or barbed wire in order to castrate GIs. While touring North Vietnam, Fonda attended performances of theater and dance, spoke with \"the blushing militia girls,\" retreated to a bomb shelter when the shells began to drop and voiced her strong opposition to the war on North Vietnamese radio. The ever available, playful Barbarella had become the American soldier's nightmare-Hanoi Jane. The Jane Fonda stories, the urinal targets and even the goodnight ritual at the Naval Academy function in military culture to stabilize and punish the dangerous female. Fonda is seen as the ultimate shapeshifter, a woman who has remade herself many times over, as ingenue, sex kitten, antiwar activist, exercise queen, wife of Ted Turner and born-again Baptist. In the face of this fluid civilian female, the military traditionally promises a one-way transformation from civilian to soldier, from boy to man, a process intended to fix a new identity, one that will travel with the soldier long after he has left active service. During the rapid troop rotations, massive antiwar demonstrations and challenges to traditional gender roles that characterized the period of the Vietnam War, when a majority of soldiers didn't see combat, the military failed to make good on its promise of transformation for many who served. As a result, they found themselves neither the innocents they were before going off to war nor the respected warriors their fathers had become when they returned from World War II. For Fonda, there is no amount of self-transformation she can undertake that will save her from being cast in legend as the figure of the seductive woman who turns out to be a snake. It's the oldest story in the world.\n\nIf the urinal targets offer the fantasy of retributive justice, fictionalized accounts of Fonda's 1972 visit with American POWs in North Vietnam charge her with conspiracy. In these word-of-mouth and Internet stories, which circulate widely among active-duty soldiers and veterans, the punishment inflicted on uncooperative POWs is linked to Fonda's presence. An oft-told variant of the torture legend depicts a single prisoner (generally considered to be POW Jerry Driscoll) who is forced to meet with Fonda and registers his defiance by spitting on the star: Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJs, he was ordered to describe for a visiting American \"Peace Activist\" the \"lenient and humane treatment\" he'd received. He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed and dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp Commandant's feet, which sent that officer berserk. In 1978, the AF Col. still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying days) from the Vietnamese Col.'s frenzied application of a wooden baton. This story is pure fiction (see links for this and the following excerpts at www.thenation.com ). The prisoners to whom it is attributed, although no fans of Fonda, have flatly denied that it happened. The most popular of all these legends is by far the most dramatic. As recounted on another anti-Fonda site: He [Larry Carrigan] spent 6 years in the \"Hilton\"-the first three of which he was \"missing in action.\" His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned/fed/clothed routine in preparation for a \"peace delegation\" visit. They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his [social security number] on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: \"Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?\" and \"Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?\" Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper. She took them all without missing a beat. At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge...and handed him the little pile of papers. Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Col Carrigan was almost number four. Such stories travel from vet to vet and soldier to soldier by word of mouth, across the back fence into the cyber fields, and even into print. One popular biography of Fonda recounts them as claims to be taken seriously, as do the Washington Times and William F. Buckley Jr., in a syndicated November 1999 article. Vietnam POWs have tried to debunk the stories falsely attributed to them. Mike McGrath, the president of NAM-POWs and a prisoner from 1967 to 1973, has denounced them. Speaking for specific POWs named in the stories, McGrath has tried to set the record straight: They had nothing to do with the article attributed to them. They ask that we get their names off that bunch of crap. Tonight I talked with Larry Carrigan. He asked that we get his name off all that crap as well. He never left a room to talk to anyone like that. No torture or beatings to see Fonda. He was living with Bud Day, John McCain and a bunch of hard-nosed resisters during the Fonda visit...lots of witnesses if you want to question him (or them). Larry was never near Jane. There were never any POWs killed on account of Jane. (Did anyone ever provide a name of one of these tortured fellows?) That story about the notes has a nice theatric touch, but no such thing ever happened. The only ones who met with Jane willingly, to my knowledge, were CDR Gene Wilber and LCOL Ed Miller. One NAM-POW was forced to go before the Fonda delegation. And I think that was only to sit at a table for a photo opportunity. I doubt he ever got a chance to talk to her, let alone slip her a note. To my knowledge, the worst that happened to the rest of us was that we had to listen to the camp radio (Radio Hanoi and Hanoi Hannah) with the Fonda propaganda. It pissed us off, but I doubt you can call that \"torture.\" So, if you get a chance to SHUT THIS STORY DOWN to the groups who are forwarding it, PLEASE DO SO.

They ask that we get their names off that bunch of crap. Tonight I talked with Larry Carrigan. He asked that we get his name off all that crap as well. He never left a room to talk to anyone like that. No torture or beatings to see Fonda. He was living with Bud Day, John McCain and a bunch of hard-nosed resisters during the Fonda visit...lots of witnesses if you want to question him (or them). Larry was never near Jane. There were never any POWs killed on account of Jane. (Did anyone ever provide a name of one of these tortured fellows?) That story about the notes has a nice theatric touch, but no such thing ever happened. The only ones who met with Jane willingly, to my knowledge, were CDR Gene Wilber and LCOL Ed Miller. One NAM-POW was forced to go before the Fonda delegation. And I think that was only to sit at a table for a photo opportunity. I doubt he ever got a chance to talk to her, let alone slip her a note. To my knowledge, the worst that happened to the rest of us was that we had to listen to the camp radio (Radio Hanoi and Hanoi Hannah) with the Fonda propaganda. It pissed us off, but I doubt you can call that \"torture.\" So, if you get a chance to SHUT THIS STORY DOWN to the groups who are forwarding it, PLEASE DO SO. Despite the efforts of McGrath and others to stanch the flow of such legends, they continue to circulate, because they satisfy their tellers and audience as a protest against one of the most outspoken critics of the military. But Fonda is not just any antiwar activist; she is a civilian woman-\"civilian\" and \"woman\" being terms that in military culture tend to collapse into each other. For the Vietnam War soldier, more than for his counterparts in any previous war, the lines between civilian and military became increasingly ambiguous. The Vietnamese who appeared one day as harmless civilians (women, children and the elderly) might on another day behave as agents of the enemy. Soldier songs, chants, jokes and stories gave voice to the soldiers' fear of a civilian population capable of transforming itself into the dreaded enemy. A version of that uncanny transformation took place stateside as well. Civilians at home, who in past wars had shown steadfast support and offered a grateful welcome to the returning soldier, became increasingly outspoken in protesting the war America had sent its soldiers to wage. These protesters grew loud in their denunciation of napalm and carpet bombing, which targeted civilians, they claimed, rather than enemy troops. They called soldiers \"baby killers\" and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\" At the end of their tour, soldiers often returned to condemnation rather than congratulations. The military has traditionally done an effective job of transforming the fresh recruit into a government-issue soldier capable of executing violence on command. By contrast, it has done very little to reverse the process and return the soldier to civilian life. Historically, the civilian population has assumed that role by ceremoniously welcoming home its soldiers with an acknowledgment of their suffering, thereby absolving the individual soldier of personal responsibility for acts performed in the name of the nation. When the civilian population refuses to accept this burden, it falls heavily on each soldier to handle it as best he can. Thus we saw a proliferation of \"rap groups,\" group therapy sessions in which vets sought the confidence of fellow participants, fellow sufferers, after the Vietnam War. In a war that featured few heroes, prisoners of war, whose sacrifice could not be challenged, enjoyed a special status. So it is not surprising that it was stories of POWs and their fictional encounters with Jane Fonda that enjoyed such a long life and such wide circulation among members of the military. Those stories rebuke the civilian who inflicts greater pain on the war's unambiguous victims. In a war in which the enemy was not clearly defined, it sometimes seemed to the unappreciated soldier that the real enemies might be back home. And in an important sense, Vietnam was a war of America against itself. The choice of Jane Fonda as the woman soldiers love to hate didn't arise solely from her highly publicized antiwar stance. Other American women were just as active in the antiwar movement. Denise Levertov, like Fonda, made a trip to North Vietnam to protest the war, and Joan Baez was every bit as much a staunch critic as Fonda. No, Fonda engendered such anger in part because she had once stood for the girl every soldier had known at home. Vietnam-era soldiers had come to know her first as the cute ingenue of Tall Story and as the daughter of a famous and admired Hollywood star and then as the sex kitten Barbarella, always ready and willing to please. Within three years of playing Barbarella, Fonda was appearing regularly in prime-time news clips condemning US involvement in Vietnam. She and other actors and writers (Donald Sutherland, Dick Gregory and Fred Gardner among them) performed in shows that satirized the military and its role in Vietnam in coffeehouses near US bases. They intended their traveling review to be an antidote to the performances of entertainers who traveled from base to base to lend their support to the troops. Those who condemned Fonda were not just disturbed by her efforts to win the hearts and minds of US servicemen through these performances and through her longtime support for Vietnam Veterans Against the War; nor was it her support for the North Vietnamese propaganda campaign that made them so angry. They saw in Fonda the American female uncannily, as if by sabotage, transformed into an enemy agent. The figure of a woman who appears to be one thing but turns out to be something more sinister or monstrous inhabits centuries of folklore. She makes her way into soldier lore as the apparently innocent but seductive foreign woman who turns out to be extremely menacing-for example, in the legends of pretty and inviting Vietnamese women who secretly laced their vaginas with broken glass, fishhooks or barbed wire in order to castrate GIs. While touring North Vietnam, Fonda attended performances of theater and dance, spoke with \"the blushing militia girls,\" retreated to a bomb shelter when the shells began to drop and voiced her strong opposition to the war on North Vietnamese radio. The ever available, playful Barbarella had become the American soldier's nightmare-Hanoi Jane. The Jane Fonda stories, the urinal targets and even the goodnight ritual at the Naval Academy function in military culture to stabilize and punish the dangerous female. Fonda is seen as the ultimate shapeshifter, a woman who has remade herself many times over, as ingenue, sex kitten, antiwar activist, exercise queen, wife of Ted Turner and born-again Baptist. In the face of this fluid civilian female, the military traditionally promises a one-way transformation from civilian to soldier, from boy to man, a process intended to fix a new identity, one that will travel with the soldier long after he has left active service. During the rapid troop rotations, massive antiwar demonstrations and challenges to traditional gender roles that characterized the period of the Vietnam War, when a majority of soldiers didn't see combat, the military failed to make good on its promise of transformation for many who served. As a result, they found themselves neither the innocents they were before going off to war nor the respected warriors their fathers had become when they returned from World War II. For Fonda, there is no amount of self-transformation she can undertake that will save her from being cast in legend as the figure of the seductive woman who turns out to be a snake. It's the oldest story in the world.\n\nThey had nothing to do with the article attributed to them. They ask that we get their names off that bunch of crap. Tonight I talked with Larry Carrigan.

The figure of a woman who appears to be one thing but turns out to be something more sinister or monstrous inhabits centuries of folklore. She makes her way into soldier lore as the apparently innocent but seductive foreign woman who turns out to be extremely menacing-for example, in the legends of pretty and inviting Vietnamese women who secretly laced their vaginas with broken glass, fishhooks or barbed wire in order to castrate GIs. While touring North Vietnam, Fonda attended performances of theater and dance, spoke with \"the blushing militia girls,\" retreated to a bomb shelter when the shells began to drop and voiced her strong opposition to the war on North Vietnamese radio. The ever available, playful Barbarella had become the American soldier's nightmare-Hanoi Jane. The Jane Fonda stories, the urinal targets and even the goodnight ritual at the Naval Academy function in military culture to stabilize and punish the dangerous female. Fonda is seen as the ultimate shapeshifter, a woman who has remade herself many times over, as ingenue, sex kitten, antiwar activist, exercise queen, wife of Ted Turner and born-again Baptist. In the face of this fluid civilian female, the military traditionally promises a one-way transformation from civilian to soldier, from boy to man, a process intended to fix a new identity, one that will travel with the soldier long after he has left active service. During the rapid troop rotations, massive antiwar demonstrations and challenges to traditional gender roles that characterized the period of the Vietnam War, when a majority of soldiers didn't see combat, the military failed to make good on its promise of transformation for many who served. As a result, they found themselves neither the innocents they were before going off to war nor the respected warriors their fathers had become when they returned from World War II. For Fonda, there is no amount of self-transformation she can undertake that will save her from being cast in legend as the figure of the seductive woman who turns out to be a snake. It's the oldest story in the world.\n\nThose who condemned Fonda were not just disturbed by her efforts to win the hearts and minds of US servicemen through these performances and through her longtime support for Vietnam Veterans Against the War; nor was it her support for the North Vietnamese propaganda campaign that made them so angry.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nOn pages 11 and 14 of this issue Tom Hayden and Carol Burke recall the culture wars of the Vietnam era, which live on in the odd, enduring hatred of Jane Fonda by conservative vets. The image of \"Hanoi Jane\" was insinuated into the 2004 presidential race in the form of a doctored photo showing Fonda sharing the stage with John Kerry at an antiwar rally (inspiring our own, less subtle attempts at deception-via-Photoshop in this issue). The stunt was carried out by conservatives trying to discredit Kerry for his antiwar activity following combat in Vietnam, in part to offset George W.'s growing reputation as a slacker who shirked his National Guard duties. The Hanoi Jane smear plays on stereotypes of war opponents, then and now, as morally corrupt, weakening the nation's martial will with their permissiveness and promiscuity. It is no coincidence that such images have surfaced now that the President has announced his support for a constitutional amendment defending the \"sanctity of marriage\" and as issues like abortion and religion loom large in the 2004 election. If a new culture war has been joined, however, it's taking place on an altered battlefield. Republicans learned the lessons of 1992, when Pat Buchanan's declaration of a cultural and religious war turned off libertarians, minorities, suburban women and moderates. Thus in 2004, Karl Rove is aiming for a delicate balance between \"compassionate conservatism\" and appeals to Passion of the Christ -lovers. He'd like to build a coalition of evangelicals, traditional Catholics and Rugged-Cross Protestants in states like West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Ohio-without provoking distress in affluent, socially liberal suburbs. Democrats are nonetheless right to charge that Bush is instigating a culture war to change the subject from the actual war, which is not going so well, not to mention the stumbling economy. Cultural issues are, of course, not just symbolic-gay rights and abortion rights have concrete, sometimes life-or-death significance for millions of people. But as George W. Bush and Karl Rove well know, they hold great symbolic value for the cultural right, and in the past such issues have helped distract Americans from their deepening credit card debt, rising healthcare costs and dwindling savings. Will that diversionary tactic work this time? Maybe not. Even some evangelicals are not convinced that a constitutional ban on gay marriage is a panacea for the country's ills. The Democrats face their own balancing act, wanting to be the party of tolerance yet fearful of a backlash should they appear too committed to a \"radical\" gay agenda (the fact that marriage is hardly a radical goal rarely comes up). Kerry has repeated his opposition to gay marriage while voicing his support for all other rights for gay couples. This rather confusing position might reflect Americans' ambivalence better than Bush's declaration that gay marriage is \"an issue that requires clarity\" (i.e., discrimination enshrined in the Constitution), but it invites criticism from those on both sides of the debate. Kerry-and the Democratic Party-are better off emphasizing their opposition to discrimination and turning up the volume on issues most voters can agree on: job creation, healthcare reform and changes in tax and trade policy to favor the non-rich. And just as Rove will use the gay marriage debate to energize the base for Bush, so the Democrats should use it to energize the millions who believe deeply in equal rights. By appealing to these voters, and to all who share their values on such cultural issues as choice, civil liberties and individual freedom, Democrats can take the high road-and take the White House.\n\nIf a new culture war has been joined, however, it's taking place on an altered battlefield.

New York City It certainly is flattering to have a five-page comprehensive review of our book, Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism and the Future [\"Riding the Third Wave,\" Dec. 11], but Michelle Jensen repeats the same pattern we critique: If it doesn't look like it did thirty years ago, it must not be feminism. The sad part of Jensen's second wave-lensed review of Manifesta is that she overlooked our subtitle altogether and rendered invisible the hundreds of examples of young women-their lives and activism-that are the purpose of the book. Women like Farai Chideya, Tali Edut and Sabrina Alcantara-Tan and the work of the Third Wave Foundation, Bust and WILD: For Human Rights-institutions founded and run by young women. We don't mind the contentious review. We've had many (they have wildly different opinions about what we did right and wrong), and they prove that feminism is as various as women are. But the contrast between the exasperated academic reviewer and the dozen or so huge, totally enthusiastic crowds of young feminists that have greeted us at college campuses over the past few months makes us think that we were on the right track with Manifesta -even without the socialist feminist theory Jensen so craved. AMY RICHARDS JENNIFER BAUMGARDNER JENSEN REPLIES Chicago I suppose it's easier for Richards and Baumgardner to paint me as an unreconstructed second waver than to engage with the political substance of my critique. What they can't quite grip, and this is where feminist \"wave theory\" reveals its simple-mindedness, is that I am their cultural contemporary. I like my platform shoes, my Dawson's Creek , my Hitachi Magic Wand, my Butchies and my campus popularity as much as the next girl: I just don't call it politics. I don't care one whit about what feminism \"looks like\" (which is why their superficial inclusion of a few token women of color fails to convince me); I care deeply, however, about my generation's ability to advance a historically conscious movement to liberate all women, no matter where they may be located in structures of class, race, sexuality, nation or generation. The manifesto to consult, for a truly liberatory blueprint, is the Redstockings': \"We identify with all women. We define our best interest as that of the poorest, most brutally exploited woman.

H. Bruce Franklin in \"Antiwar and Proud of It\" [Dec.11] tells of the aircraft carrier Constellation's crew petitioning for Jane Fonda's antiwar road show to be allowed to perform aboard. In 1971-72 I was a Marine lieutenant out of the Air Force Academy stationed in Okinawa when Hanoi Jane's show performed in the city of Koza. It was exuberantly attended by thousands in uniform, many just back from Vietnam, as Nixon pulled the troops out. I returned to the States in '72 to resign my commission out of a sense of the evil of the man (this was pre-Watergate break-in) and increasing discordance between principle and reality, but a vehicular accident broke my back before my request cleared. Support for the antiwar movement was feverish even among the uniformed, many of whom attended the show so that they could have their pictures taken by intelligence personnel and go on record. GREGORY C. O'KELLY Davis, Ill. I beg to differ with H. Bruce Franklin on the 1945 transport of the French military and Legionnaires to Saigon. I was on Army transport ships then. We were civilian merchant marines, not enlisted men. I doubt that the Navy would protest-that would be considered mutiny. But whoever did it, I deeply wish that Misters Truman and Nixon had listened. \"They're not listening still. Perhaps they never will.\" CLARENCE \"BUD\" OHSE Baltimore If Jerry Lembcke found \"not a shred of evidence\" that Vietnam vets were spat upon, it doesn't mean there was none. I am acquainted with a man who was on active duty stateside in the mid-sixties and was walking down the street of a western Massachusetts city when someone came up and spat in his face. He didn't run looking for sociologists to tell his story to, but it happened. It is good to recall and affirm the strengths of the antiwar movement. It is not good to create new distortions in the attempt to offset old ones. KATHARINE W. RYLAARSDAM FRANKLIN REPLIES Newark, N.J. The crews of the US ships being used to transport an invasion army to Vietnam in 1945 were indeed all in the merchant marine; it was the enlisted crewmen (i.e., nonofficers) who unanimously protested this complicity with colonialism. While there may possibly have been isolated cases of servicepeople being spat upon, there is no contemporaneous evidence of such incidents. More important, although such behavior was never part of the antiwar movement, it is an image of antiwar protesters rampant in American culture today. Both these topics are explored with thorough documentation in my book, Vietnam and Other American Fantasies . BRUCE H. FRANKLIN BEWARE: PROGRESSIVE = DRUGGIE! Johnson City, N.Y. Jane Spencer's \"Caught in the WAVE\" [Dec. 4] reminded me of a recent work purporting to link high school students' interest in progressive causes to drug abuse. In How Parents Can Help Children Live Marijuana Free , written by University of Utah criminologist Gerald Smith and others and published by Walt Plum, \"excessive preoccupation with social causes, race relations, environmental issues, etc.\" are listed as some of the \"social signs of regular [drug] users.\" The sixty-plus-page booklet, distributed to parents of students in the Salt Lake City School District with the blessing of the district, prompted parents of two students to pull their children off the debate team. Students may now be targeted not only for acting or appearing different, but also for reading The Nation ! ALLEN LUTINS THEY WERE PRINCIPLED IDEALISTS Walnut Creek, Calif. It may seem unappreciative for a former Communist to be critical of the relatively reasoned article on \"The Right's Cold War Revision,\" by Ellen Schrecker and Maurice Isserman [July 24/31, \"Letters,\" Oct. 9]. The very rules of engagement in this discussion seem to begin with the docile acceptance as received word of the outpourings of double and triple agents from Moscow's murky Venona files. Schrecker and Isserman are no exception, stating: \"As Venona and the Moscow sources reveal, the [US] party recruited dozens, perhaps hundreds, of its members to spy for the Soviet Union.\" Who were all these spies, and how come they were never named and prosecuted? Hoover's FBI says it had the party thoroughly infiltrated (hardly the difficult feat that melodramatic movies made it). What these FBI agents would most want to present to the Boss was proof of espionage. Never happened. Schrecker and Isserman do American Communists the dubious favor of writing, \"Acknowledging that some American Communists spied on behalf of the Soviet Union does not reduce the entire history of their movement to a criminal conspiracy.\" Thanks a lot. How much of its history does it reduce to a criminal conspiracy? Half? Three-quarters? Are there any historians out there to say straight out that American Communists, despite their sins, were patriots who advocated something more human than corporate capitalism for this land of ours and fought hard and effectively for social justice in the meanwhile? Yes, they were starry-eyed over the emergence of the world's first nation to proclaim itself socialist and place people above profits, and yes, they were lamentably slow to accept the reality that Stalinism had butchered the socialist dream. But when \"liberal anticommunists\" were doing diddly about the shame of raw racial discrimination, it was the Communists who exposed the Scottsboro rape frameup, who put their bodies where their mouths were, going South to work for black voting rights, who with the black newspapers launched the campaign that ended the apartheid ban in our national pastime, who did the indispensable on-the-ground organizing in the creation of industrial unionism. If the Communist movement was the malign spy apparatus Radosh, Klehr, Haynes and Weisberg say it was, how would they explain its attraction to so many of the world's most leading creative men and women? On a personal note, I worked for the Communist Daily Worker for twenty years and found my colleagues to be principled idealists, the salt of the American earth. Will history, dictated by \"liberal (?) anti-communists,\" harden by default into the \"spy\" falsehood for this significant part of the American radical left? LESTER RODNEY MY SECRET LOVE'S NO SECRET ANYMORE Frisco, Colo. I've been a subscriber to The Nation for more than twenty years, and I'm finally getting off my butt and writing. I have a confession. I'm in love with Katha Pollitt's column. Whenever I'm not sure how to express my feelings, I wait for Pollitt's column, and there they are-my feelings articulated perfectly. I live in a rural community without residential mail service, so I have to drive to the post office. I empty my box every couple of days, and when I get my Nation , the first thing I do is open it to Katha's column and savor her comments paragraph by paragraph. Then I sit back in my minivan smiling as I hug my Nation . And that warm, fuzzy feeling lasts all day, because Katha's column makes me realize that I have a choice. I can either become depressed, or I can laugh, or I can do a bit of both. Am I alone? I can't be the only reader whose idea of a good time is settling back into my minivan high-back seat in front of the post office in a one-stoplight town in the mountains of Colorado reading Katha's column. So why doesn't it appear weekly? IRA WERTENTEIL\n\nFEMINIST GENERATION GAP?

The sad part of Jensen's second wave-lensed review of Manifesta is that she overlooked our subtitle altogether and rendered invisible the hundreds of examples of young women-their lives and activism-that are the purpose of the book.

We don't mind the contentious review. We've had many (they have wildly different opinions about what we did right and wrong), and they prove that feminism is as various as women are. But the contrast between the exasperated academic reviewer and the dozen or so huge, totally enthusiastic crowds of young feminists that have greeted us at college campuses over the past few months makes us think that we were on the right track with Manifesta -even without the socialist feminist theory Jensen so craved.

H. Bruce Franklin in \"Antiwar and Proud of It\" [Dec.11] tells of the aircraft carrier Constellation's crew petitioning for Jane Fonda's antiwar road show to be allowed to perform aboard. In 1971-72 I was a Marine lieutenant out of the Air Force Academy stationed in Okinawa when Hanoi Jane's show performed in the city of Koza. It was exuberantly attended by thousands in uniform, many just back from Vietnam, as Nixon pulled the troops out. I returned to the States in '72 to resign my commission out of a sense of the evil of the man (this was pre-Watergate break-in) and increasing discordance between principle and reality, but a vehicular accident broke my back before my request cleared. Support for the antiwar movement was feverish even among the uniformed, many of whom attended the show so that they could have their pictures taken by intelligence personnel and go on record. GREGORY C. O'KELLY Davis, Ill. I beg to differ with H. Bruce Franklin on the 1945 transport of the French military and Legionnaires to Saigon. I was on Army transport ships then. We were civilian merchant marines, not enlisted men. I doubt that the Navy would protest-that would be considered mutiny. But whoever did it, I deeply wish that Misters Truman and Nixon had listened. \"They're not listening still. Perhaps they never will.\" CLARENCE \"BUD\" OHSE Baltimore If Jerry Lembcke found \"not a shred of evidence\" that Vietnam vets were spat upon, it doesn't mean there was none. I am acquainted with a man who was on active duty stateside in the mid-sixties and was walking down the street of a western Massachusetts city when someone came up and spat in his face. He didn't run looking for sociologists to tell his story to, but it happened. It is good to recall and affirm the strengths of the antiwar movement. It is not good to create new distortions in the attempt to offset old ones. KATHARINE W. RYLAARSDAM FRANKLIN REPLIES Newark, N.J. The crews of the US ships being used to transport an invasion army to Vietnam in 1945 were indeed all in the merchant marine; it was the enlisted crewmen (i.e., nonofficers) who unanimously protested this complicity with colonialism. While there may possibly have been isolated cases of servicepeople being spat upon, there is no contemporaneous evidence of such incidents. More important, although such behavior was never part of the antiwar movement, it is an image of antiwar protesters rampant in American culture today.

The crews of the US ships being used to transport an invasion army to Vietnam in 1945 were indeed all in the merchant marine; it was the enlisted crewmen (i.e., nonofficers) who unanimously protested this complicity with colonialism. While there may possibly have been isolated cases of servicepeople being spat upon, there is no contemporaneous evidence of such incidents. More important, although such behavior was never part of the antiwar movement, it is an image of antiwar protesters rampant in American culture today.

I am acquainted with a man who was on active duty stateside in the mid-sixties and was walking down the street of a western Massachusetts city when someone came up and spat in his face.

      "text": "Queen Jane, Approximately\n\nAugust. The dog days of 2007. The whole world seemed to be wilting. Jane Fonda-the actress, philanthropist, feminist, political activist, model, Christian, blogger, fitness advocate, licensing magnate, and memoirist-impeccable and straight-backed in a light-colored chiffon dress, was attending an outdoor wedding reception in Brooklyn. The groom was Fonda's son, the actor Troy Garity, who had married the actress Simone Bent earlier that day. Before the reception began, Fonda marched over to one of the bar tables, followed by a coterie of younger men. \"I'm the mother of the groom and I need a drink!\" she announced to the startled bartender. She took a sip of her vodka-and-orange-juice and looked around at the crowd, which included her eldest child, the documentary filmmaker Vanessa Vadim, and her youngest, Mary Luana Williams, a park ranger, the child of Black Panthers, whom Fonda had unofficially adopted in the seventies. Then she raised her glass and said, ruefully regarding the proceedings, \"More than my old man did for me.\"\n\nAs the evening progressed, the parents of both the bride and the groom made speeches. Speaking off the cuff, Garity's father, the political activist and politician Tom Hayden, who was Fonda's second husband (neither parent wanted Troy to bear the weight of a famous last name), said that he was especially happy about his son's union with Bent, who is black, because, among other things, it was \"another step in a long-term goal of mine: the peaceful, nonviolent disappearance of the white race.\" Hayden turned the floor over to his ex-wife this way: \"Now Jane wants to say a few words. The new mother-in-law. We know how Jane always becomes the part she's playing. Hopefully, that won't be the case in our son's marriage!\" There was a silence. Fonda had just played Viola Fields, the domineering title character in Robert Luketic's movie \"Monster-in-Law.\" Pulling a sheaf of papers from her purse, Fonda looked concerned, tense. She had written this script herself. She began by apologizing: \"Unlike Tom, who can speak extemporaneously, I have to write everything down.\" For Troy, she continued, Hayden had been \"the parent.\" \"I was usually off making a movie somewhere. Tom was the one who had dinner with Troy every single night.\" Then, referring to her notes, she talked about how Native Americans had once lived where we were now and how her ancestors had sailed from Holland to New York. When the speeches were over, Hayden hugged his son and his new in-laws and rejoined the party, while Fonda, the image of maternal responsibility, went to each of the hundred or so seated guests, shaking their hands and thanking them individually for coming.\n\nAnother role, a different stage. Spring, 2009. This time Fonda was appearing not as a version of herself but as Dr. Katherine Brandt, a musicologist suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, who was gripped by one last question: why did Beethoven, toward the end of his life, devote so much time to composing thirty-three variations on an insignificant waltz written by Diabelli, a composer of no great distinction?\n\nFonda was starring in \"33 Variations,\" by Moisés Kaufman, her first Broadway performance since 1963. Standing motionless in a white spotlight that emphasized her dark hair and gardenia-white skin, she conveyed her character's drama largely through her voice. Her urgent, seductive, imploring tone was recognizable from her innumerable speeches and interviews and forty-odd film performances, which, over the course of half a century or so, set the template for countless actors, writers, and directors interested in depicting the ever-evolving life of the modern American woman. As she performed in Kaufman's play, Fonda didn't so much smash the stage's fourth wall as ignore it. What she communicated, above and beyond the words of the script, was her desire to inhabit her character's lonely imagination.\n\n\"She makes no distinction between the world in which she lives and the work she does on the stage,\" Kaufman said of Fonda. \"The things she learns in one realm help her in the other.\" Although Kaufman had considered other performers, by the time he met Fonda, in New York, in October, 2008, he told me, he knew that he wanted her for the part. \"There are actresses who do emotional wonders, and there are actresses who can do very intelligent roles but are very dry,\" he said. Fonda, he explained, could do both.\n\nBefore their meeting, Kaufman watched a video clip in which Barbara Walters talked about how Fonda got annoyed when people weren't punctual. He arrived an hour early for their seven-o'clock appointment at the Algonquin Hotel. \"At six-forty-five the elevator opens, and it's her,\" Kaufman said. \"And she shakes my hand and says, 'I knew you were going to be on time. Reading your play, I know you're that kind of person. You've done your research.' \" Kaufman went on, \"She ordered a Martini. And then we kept talking. Later, she says, 'You know, two Martinis ago, you said . . .' And I said, 'Jane, you have to do this play. Any woman who measures time by the number of Martinis consumed is somebody I must work with.' \"\n\nOnce \"33 Variations\" closed, after eighty-five performances (Fonda was nominated for a Best Actress Tony), the actress travelled to Los Angeles for knee-replacement surgery. While recuperating, she stayed at the house of a friend, the producer Paula Weinstein. Fonda (who has since moved to L.A.) was then based in Atlanta-in a loft whose entranceway was designed to resemble a vulva. (When Bill Maher talked to Fonda about this on his television program in 2005, he asked her if there was a back way into her home. She invited him over to find out.) Weinstein's house, on the other hand, was a fairly traditional New England-inspired affair, just off Sunset Boulevard, in Beverly Hills, amid split-level houses, dusty palm trees, and lonely, nondescript streets. Fonda's assistant ushered me into the house, and, as two small dogs ran barking toward me, I heard a familiar voice: \"I need you!\" Fonda's command silenced even the dogs, but when I entered the living room she hunched her shoulders and giggled: an actress in need of a director. Her costume for the day was a long-sleeved peach-colored top and a prairie skirt, and she was sitting, with her legs extended, in front of a computer screen. What she \"needed,\" she explained, was for me to help her figure out how to e-mail a document on her new computer. After the problem had been solved, Fonda stood, with the aid of a cane, to show me how her recovery was progressing. \"Isn't it amazing?\" she said, walking back and forth. \"I'm a little sore today, though. I wore high heels last night.\" When I asked why she'd worn heels so soon after her operation, she said, chastened, \"Vanity.\"\n\nFonda sat down. To test my tape recorder, I said, into the microphone, \"This is Hilton Als, observing Jane Fonda.\"\n\nFonda grabbed the mike, delighted to transform the moment into a performance, and said, \"And this is Jane Fonda, who loves being observed.\"\n\nI asked her something I had wanted to ask since her son's wedding: Why had she said that Hayden was \"the parent\"? Hadn't her role as provider for the family made her just as important? She shook her head and pounded her fist on her chest. \"I remember once reading 'Huckleberry Finn' to Troy, after I'd been away shooting a film,\" she said. \"And Troy looked up at me and asked, 'What's the point of having a mother?' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn her best work, Fonda has portrayed women who suffer a kind of spiritual orphanhood, emotionally abandoned by families that were never quite families. \"I felt alone, surrounded by lights\" is how she describes her early days of acting, but it could as easily apply to her childhood. Even her birth name sounds like that of a solitary princess in some dark fairy tale. Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda was the firstborn child of Frances Ford Seymour, a society beauty, and Henry Fonda, the Nebraska-born actor who, as the film historian David Thomson says, \"played some of the most important heroic figures in American film.\" Fonda père was famously critical, perpetually dissatisfied, and notoriously uneasy when it came to dealing with emotion on or off the stage. \"He hated people to cry,\" Jane said. \"I was told when he was rehearsing 'Two for the Seesaw,' with Anne Bancroft, and she had a scene where she would get very emotional, he was so angry that she was actually crying and being emotional he stormed offstage and came back with a mirror and said, 'Look at yourself-it's disgusting.' That kind of vulnerability terrified him.\"\n\nThe director Peter Bogdanovich said that Henry Fonda communicated \"insecurity in just being himself.\" Off-screen, he seems to have spent a substantial amount of time trying to shape his children in his image. In an even-tempered memoir, \"Don't Tell Dad\" (1998), Jane's younger brother, Peter, recalls his father's attempts to transform him. \"I was a skinny little boy,\" he writes. \"It embarrassed Dad, and . . . he did everything he could think of to help me put on weight\"-including feeding his son beer for lunch when he was seven. He sought to mold his daughter's body, too. In her best-selling 2005 memoir, \"My Life So Far,\" she writes, \"Once I hit adolescence, the only time my father ever referred to how I looked was when he thought I was too fat [or] wanted me to wear a different, less revealing bathing suit, a looser belt, or a longer dress.\" Henry also controlled his children by withholding attention and approval. When the thirteen-year-old Fonda fractured five vertebrae in a swimming accident, she didn't tell her father about it for nearly a week, and then he had her stepmother deal with it. When Henry Fonda died, he left nothing to Jane or to Peter. Patricia Bosworth, whose biography \"Becoming Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman,\" will be published in August, told me his will made it clear that he didn't think they needed it.\n\nThe Fonda children wouldn't have felt their father's emotional distance so strongly if their mother had been entirely present. In 1948, when Jane was ten, the family left her childhood home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, so that her father could do theatre work in New York. By then, Frances Fonda had been hospitalized several times for depression. When she wasn't in the hospital, she paced her darkened bedroom in an anxious, distracted manner. Fonda describes their home in those years as \"Charles Addamsy.\" To help relieve Frances's suburban malaise, a New York City friend gave her the keys to her apartment. One night, she woke to find Frances staring down at her neck. \"I was just curious where the jugular vein is,\" she said.\n\nIn the fall of 1949, Henry asked for a divorce. Soon afterward, Frances entered a psychiatric hospital, and by April, 1950, she was dead. Henry persuaded the children's schoolteachers, classmates, and maternal grandmother to tell them that Frances had died of a heart attack. In fact, she had slashed her own throat. Her daughter learned the truth from a movie magazine that one of her classmates slipped her several months after the fact. A former boyfriend remembers that Fonda was always \"puzzled why she didn't feel more about her mother and the fact that she killed herself. I remember her telling me that when she first found out about her mother she just laughed and tried to shut it out. She realized that this was not a normal reaction, that it was a kind of symptom of emotional dishonesty.\" Now, when Fonda discusses her mother, she does so either in a flat, matter-of-fact tone (in her memoir, she writes, \"Mother had killed herself ten months before a new house she'd been building for us was finished. It was April and I guess she couldn't wait\") or in a language that's baroque and unreal (\"My mother? She was a golden thread running through our lives\").\n\nA childhood friend of Fonda's once noted that the gloomier a situation is the more radiant the efficiency with which she responds. (Fonda says that she has a habit of trying to make things better for other people, of wanting to \"smooth out the Kleenex.\") There was something almost competitive about her resilience after Frances's death: My mother chose to die. I will choose the opposite. \"No matter what's going on in your life, there's a part of you that's like radar, that's constantly scanning the horizon,\" Fonda told me. \"And if it picks up any warm body, meaning someone who could give you nurture and direction and support, you glom.\" Fonda was drawn to the mothers of her girlfriends, who could \"tell you what was right and what was wrong and what mattered.\"\n\nAlthough she tended to romanticize the women she encountered, Fonda didn't really want to become one. \"For me, being a woman meant being a victim, being the loser, being the one that'll be destroyed,\" she told me. Bulimia helped her stave off womanhood, at least for a time. In 1952, Fonda was a sophomore at the all-female Emma Willard School, in Troy, New York, where a classmate taught her how to \"gorge and purge.\" (To dine with Fonda is still an interesting experience. She attacks meals with a kind of furious vengeance.) Fonda says that her illness continued for years, and was \"intensified under two conditions: when I was working and had to look good, and when I was in an inauthentic relationship, which I was in a lot.\"\n\nIn 1958, when she was twenty, a recent Vassar College dropout, struggling with depression and living with her father in Santa Monica, Fonda became friends with Susan Strasberg, the daughter of Lee Strasberg, a co-founder of the Actors Studio. Susan pressed Fonda to meet with her father. Although Fonda had performed in a few amateur productions as a student-she had once even shared a summer-stock stage with her father-she didn't feel driven to act until she was admitted to one of Strasberg's New York acting classes. With his encouragement, Fonda came alive. \"I was the most alienated, disembodied person, and I was just kind of going along,\" she said. \"Because it was him, as opposed to my father or someone in the family, I could take it in.\" In Thomas Kiernan's 1973 book, \"Jane: An Intimate Biography of Jane Fonda,\" a fellow-student recalls Fonda's first exercise on Strasberg's stage:\n\nThe class was particularly crowded that day. A lot of people from the other classes had heard about it and were there to see her fall on her face. But she didn't. In fact, she was terrific. You could see this change go through her. The first impression she gave was her nervousness. . . . Then you could see her start to relax and get caught up in it. Pretty soon she was letting it all hang out. Everybody was pretty impressed. Not only with the actor's talent she showed but with her guts. Now that I think back on it, it was inevitable that she be good . . . what with so many people secretly hoping she'd be bad.\n\nFrom the beginning, Fonda was dogged about her craft. \"I felt that I had to prove myself-that it was me and not my father's daughter,\" Fonda told me. \"Everybody would take one class, I'd take four. They'd work on one scene, I'd work on three.\" Her childhood friend the actress Brooke Hayward said, \"Acting gave her the kind of applause she never got as a human being. I've never seen ambition as naked as Jane's.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn Fonda's early performances, the tension between her drive and her desire to be seen as a conventional, unthreatening girl is clear. In her first film, \"Tall Story\" (1960), in which she plays a marriage-minded college cheerleader, she has a stridency that suggests a wildness of character which she herself doesn't want to acknowledge. Fonda was reluctant to admit that she was ambitious-especially not to a man. Good girls raised in the Eisenhower years didn't lift their skirts and reveal their balls. As Fonda began to make a name for herself onstage-in 1960, she was voted the \"most promising actress of the year\" by the New York Drama Critics' Circle for her performance as a rape victim in \"There Was a Little Girl\"-inevitably she attracted the attention of some important figures in the industry. One night, the critic Kenneth Tynan took her out to dinner. \"He asked me, 'What do you want to achieve?' \" Fonda told me. \"And I said, 'I want the audience to accept me.' And he laughed. That was, for him, a glimpse into the fact that I didn't feel like the person that he thought I was. I mean, what a lame answer!\" Around the same time, the director Elia Kazan asked to see Fonda for a film he was casting, \"Splendor in the Grass.\" The interview consisted of Kazan asking Fonda if she was ambitious. She couldn't say yes. Forty years later, still smarting at having lost the part to Natalie Wood, Fonda said, \"You know what I should have said to Kazan? 'Are you kidding? Of course I'm fucking ambitious!' \"\n\nIn \"Tall Story,\" Fonda was an attractive enough ingénue-the studio head, Jack Warner, had insisted that she wear falsies-but she didn't stand out. As Time reported, \"Nothing could possibly save the picture . . . not even a second-generation Fonda with a smile like her father's and legs like a chorus girl.\" Four more bland roles followed-in movies such as \"Period of Adjustment\" (1962) and \"In the Cool of the Day\" (1963)-as well as a searing documentary by D. A. Pennebaker, \"Jane\" (1962), about her experience in the doomed Broadway play \"The Fun Couple,\" which closed after only three performances. (The film shows Fonda at the mercy of her director and sometime lover Andréas Voutsinas, whose approval she clearly longs for, even as her need for self-expression is palpable. \"She wanted the world to know who she was, not the person she was playing,\" Pennebaker told me.)\n\nFonda decided to try her luck in France, where the New Wave movement was in full swing. But before boarding the plane she had a mission. \"I had a long weekend off,\" she recalled, \"and I was obsessed with meeting Henry Miller, so at a hundred and twenty miles an hour I drove to Big Sur to find him.\" She didn't find Miller, but in the Big Sur Hot Springs Lodge (later the site of the Esalen Institute) she got her first taste of the countercultural world that she would later come to represent. She stayed for three weeks and had an affair with the man who ran the lodge. \"I remember the first night I was there, I was in the dining room, and these girls waiting on me had hair under their arms and tie-dyed skirts. I'd never seen hippies. I was so straight. They were having babies in the woods, with goats wandering in and out of their houses, and throwing the I Ching. And I thought, I could stop right here. This is very appealing to me.\" Fonda was torn-as she would be for most of her life-between the reality of her ambition and the romance she found in circles far removed from the one she was born into. \"I had to make a major choice,\" she said. \"This could be my life, and I could stay here, or I could go.\" She went.\n\nWhat she went to was her first onscreen exploration of evil. As the conniving poor relative of a rich pampered woman in René Clément's \"Les Félins\" (1964), Fonda conveys a shimmering narcissism that cuts through the film's synthetic \"artiness.\" The movie tanked, but Fonda was taken up by the French press, which dubbed her \" la B.B. Américaine \"-the American Brigitte Bardot. Undoubtedly, this moniker caught the attention of the director Roger Vadim, who had made Bardot a star with his 1956 film \"And God Created Woman.\" Now Vadim-who was as famous for his amours with Bardot and Catherine Deneuve as for his titillating morality tales-led Fonda to her next incarnation: a mischievous icon who brought an American naïveté and sensibleness to sex in such movies as \"La Ronde\" (1964) and \"Barbarella\" (1968). A cult classic, \"Barbarella,\" with a screenplay co-written by Terry Southern, was based on a soft-core comic strip that had run in the hip, leftist Evergreen Review . Fonda played, as Vadim put it, \"a kind of sexual Alice in Wonderland of the future\" on an interplanetary mission. In the opening scene, she performs a striptease with her armored spacesuit in zero gravity, before landing naked on an orange shag rug. Fonda's wide-eyed incredulity in the role was derided by feminists at the time. Even Fonda now refers to herself at that point in her career as a \"female impersonator.\"\n\nWhile planning their first film together, Fonda and Vadim became involved, and by the time \"La Ronde\" wrapped, Fonda had decided to stay in France. She lived there for six years. Fonda told me, \"Working in French, it's a double mask. There's the mask of playing a character, but then also it's a different language, so I felt really safe.\" Despite her accomplishments, however, she felt disconnected from her public persona. \"What I felt I was and what other people saw were very different things,\" she said. \"I didn't know who I was or what I wanted or where I was going. I had absolutely no confidence in myself. Which is how come Vadim could kind of come along and make something of me.\"\n\nIn 1965, the couple married. \"I cried when we were pronounced man and wife,\" Fonda wrote in her memoir. \"I hadn't realized how much formalizing our relationship would mean to me.\" Fonda wanted to be the perfect wife. (She still says that her ideal woman \"has a child on her hip, and she's stirring pots and she's sipping her wine, and she's funny, and she can turn out a great meal for forty people without losing her sense of humor and without getting stressed.\") But the world kept encroaching. Much of the news of the day came to Fonda via the French actress Simone Signoret, who had become a friend. In 1968, Signoret took Fonda, who had paid scant attention to what was happening in Vietnam, to her first antiwar rally. \"It was all about how horrible America was, and I didn't like it,\" Fonda said. \"I really believed that if we were fighting, there was a reason for it.\" But later that year she read Jonathan Schell's book \"The Village of Ben Suc,\" a report of an attack on a Vietnamese village and its demolition. \"And, you know, it's like everything went flip,\" she said. \"And the world changed.\"\n\nIn the next couple of years, Fonda became a vocal opponent of the war, though she still wasn't convinced that she was smart enough to deal with politics: \"Simone would be talking to me in a very serious and intellectually challenging way, and I always wanted to say, 'Who is that you're talking to? You're not talking to me that way.' I felt that people saw something in me, and it scared me to death, because I didn't see it.\" Fonda's budding activism distanced her from Vadim. Plus, she told me, although being in love with your director can be \"very heady,\" Vadim, while filming \"Barbarella,\" was \"drunk by noon, and it was pretty horrible.\" By the time she returned to the United States, in 1969, with Vadim and their baby, Vanessa, who was born in 1968, Fonda was ready for a change.\n\nNineteen-sixty-nine, in movie theatres around the country: the feature begins. Jane Fonda's hardened, hopeless face fills the screen. A shock of disbelief and then recognition ripples through the audience. How did the actress whom Pauline Kael described as \"that naughty-innocent comedienne\" become so tragic and genuine? When did she put aside her white-girl upper-middle-class privilege and come to embody the reality of womanhood and its marginalization?\n\n\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" is based on Horace McCoy's grim 1935 novel about Depression-era contestants in a marathon dance competition. Fonda's character, Gloria, an aspiring actress who enters the contest, with a chip on her shoulder, and is driven to suicide by the outcome, was described by the Times critic Vincent Canby as a \"Typhoid Mary of existential despair,\" a \"terrified and terrifying heroine.\" Fonda's performance heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Pauline Kael, in her New Yorker review of the film, noted of Fonda:\n\n[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. . . . Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn't try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind \"vulgar\" roles to assure us she's not really like that. . . . Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.\n\nLink copied\n\nWith \"They Shoot Horses,\" Fonda began not only to infiltrate the mainstream as a serious artist but to speak more directly to the margins as well. Her ability to become Gloria was, no doubt, based in part on her jettisoning of another role: wife to Vadim. For the movie, Fonda had to cut the long dyed-blond coif she'd adopted, as she puts it, \"to compete with the wives\"-Vadim's exes. Her new shorn look was a declaration of sorts: personally and professionally, she was moving on.\n\nIn 1971, Fonda was at an antiwar rally at the Fort Lewis military base, alongside a woman who had brought her baby. The woman asked Fonda where her daughter was, and she had to admit that Vanessa was with a nanny in Bel Air. The discrepancy between her life and the lives of the people she was championing made her more and more uncomfortable. \"And I remember I was thinking, O.K., I'm not going to do movies anymore,\" she said. \"But I became friends with Ken Cockrel, who was a black revolutionary lawyer. And he said, 'The revolution needs movie stars. That's a responsibility.' And that's when I started thinking about my career differently: it's about how I do the work, what I choose to do, and, hopefully, taking charge of what I do.\"\n\nBy the time Jane Fonda, at thirty-two, began work on Alan J. Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971), she was becoming, like her character, the author of her own contradictions. Fonda's remarkable portrayal of the call girl and would-be actress Bree Daniels as the embodiment of the alienation of modern life is sociology-free. It's no classroom flick; you watch it, you live it, as people have for decades, largely because Fonda herself is invisible in it. It is Bree alone who allows us into the theatre of her bedroom. The dramatic speech with which she cajoles one of her clients is chillingly erotic:\n\nHas anybody . . . um talked to you about the financial arrangements? Well, it depends naturally on how long you want me for . . . And what you want to do. ( Laugh .) I know you. It will be very nice. Um, well, I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's-if you'd like that? Have you ever been with a woman before? Paying her? Do you like it? I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly. . . . I have a good imagination, and I like pleasing. Do you mind if I take my sweater off? Well, I think in the confines of one's house, one should be . . . free of clothing and inhibitions. Oh, inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome. ( Laugh .) Don't be afraid. I'm not. As long as you don't, uh, hurt me more than I like to be hurt. I will do anything you ask. You should never be ashamed of things like that, I mean you mustn't be. . . . I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to, is to let it all hang out. You know, do it all, and, fuck it.\n\nFonda's Bree has no home but herself, and she doesn't even want to live there very much. Like Louise Brooks's Lulu, the brilliant, self-destructive anti-heroine of G. W. Pabst's \"Pandora's Box\" (1929), she is alone, manipulative, and wise to the nastiness of desire. In their performances, Brooks and Fonda gave a face and a narrative shape to the complex and developing questions of feminism. What does a woman want? Male approval or an identity of her own? Are these desires mutually exclusive? Notably, both Fonda and Brooks created a distinctive \"look\" that served as shorthand for their modernism and their difference: Brooks had the bob, Fonda the shag.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, a few months after \"33 Variations\" closed on Broadway, Fonda was heading from New York to Dallas to participate in a \"media salon\" and fund-raiser for the Women's Media Center, an organization that Fonda started with the feminist writers Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, in 2005. Fonda had invited me along for the trip.\n\nThe stated goal of the Women's Media Center is to encourage the telling of women's stories by women writers. The Dallas event was co-hosted by Trea Yip, an immigrant from China who had made considerable strides since coming to America, as was evident by the palatial size of her home and the fiscal well-being of her guests, who had each been asked to donate at least twenty-five hundred dollars. The dinner was held outside, under a portico, where women with substantial hair and jewels sat chatting at tables. It was a select bunch: well-dressed, well-mannered women, who had done well for themselves or helped their husbands do well, but were no less enthusiastic for that. (The Women's Media Center amusingly acknowledges, in one press release, the various stages that feminism has gone through over the years: \"Every decade, the feminist movement's obituary gets a rewrite, but gender inequality is alive and well!\") Fonda wore a green suit, leopard-skin sandals, and a brilliant blue ring on her right hand. After talking to me for a while, she excused herself, saying, \"I have to figure out who is the richest person here!\"\n\nLater, she circled an area of the living room where a lectern had been set up, testing the space, before the feminist theoretician Helen LaKelly Hunt took the floor. \"How do you introduce someone who's so beloved and so known?\" Hunt said. \"Jane and I bonded when she found out I loved the Scriptures, and that there was a place for us feminists in religion. What can I say except there's starch in her spine and belief in her eyes?\" Fonda embraced Hunt. Crickets chirped and bracelets clattered in the night. Fonda began with a reference to the conservatives in the state. Several sharp intakes of breath could be heard. She persevered. \"They want to get rid of all the gays, all the feminists, and make our country an old-boys' club. The question is, What are we going to do with our boys?\" She paused. Her voice gained momentum. \"We have a toxic masculinity!\"\n\nThe issue of \"toxic masculinity\" hounded Fonda for decades. For instance, when she appeared on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1970, soon after the release of \"They Shoot Horses,\" Cavett introduced her in a characteristically condescending way: \"My next guest is the prettiest member of the flying Fonda family-sounds like a circus act, really, but they are. She's an outspoken lady, as you may know, if you've ever seen Jane Fonda. I remember when she was just a movie star, and now she's . . . lately she's been in the news pages, being arrested for things and all!\" Later in the program, after Fonda spoke passionately about veterans' groups that opposed the atrocities being committed in Vietnam, Cavett interjected, \"Jane is all het up, I see.\"\n\nIn July, 1972, during the height of Fonda's public opposition to the war, she spent two weeks in North Vietnam, as a guest of the Vietnam Committee of Solidarity with the American People. She was carrying more than a hundred letters for American P.O.W.s. She had also agreed to photograph the dikes that held back the waters of the Red River Delta, protecting more than fifteen million Vietnamese peasants from flooding-and which American forces had targeted for bombing. She delivered several broadcasts over Radio Hanoi, in which she addressed U.S. soldiers directly, urging them to \"remain human beings\" and to put an end to the war.\n\nLink copied\n\nDuring the trip, Fonda was photographed sitting on the seat of a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. The response to the image back home was virulent, earning her the nickname Hanoi Jane. After she returned, a man representing what he called the American Liberty League threatened to assassinate her as a \"traitor to the U.S.\" She was publicly denounced by a Maryland state legislator, William J. Burkhead, and in Colorado a state representative, Michael Strang, called her a \"foulmouthed, offensive little Vassar dropout.\" As Mary Hershberger observes, in her book \"Jane Fonda's War\" (2005), \"Almost all of the columnists and reporters who wrote contemptuous reports were male. They usually focused on what she looked like, and seldom on her ideas or the issues she raised. . . . She 'harangued,' she talked too fast . . . she didn't smile enough, she didn't have a sense of humor.\" Fonda attributes the vehemence of the response to both gender and class. \"I was Henry Fonda's daughter. I was privileged. I was Barbarella. They had my posters in their locker rooms. So I betrayed class, I betrayed gender, and I betrayed, you know-you're a pinup girl, you're not supposed to speak. It would have been less pungent if I had been a man.\" She paused, before conceding that having allowed that photograph to be taken \"was the biggest lapse of judgment in my life.\" She added, \"I don't regret going to North Vietnam. I'm glad I went. I'm glad I did everything I did, except that.\"\n\nTom Hayden, a radical from Detroit and one of the founders of the Students for a Democratic Society, was the kind of man Henry Fonda had played in movies-a man of principle, who never failed to fight the good fight-with the added attraction of being working class, which Fonda found sexy. They started seeing each other in 1972. \"I loved his playfulness, the Irish juiciness that brought welcomed moisture to what I felt was my arid, Protestant nature,\" Fonda wrote in her memoir. Plus, Hayden wasn't intimidated by his famous girlfriend; indeed, he pitied her for \"the image of superficial sexiness she once promoted and was now trying to shake,\" he recalled in his 1989 memoir \"Reunion.\" They married in January, 1973, and Troy was born six months later.\n\nIn the spring of 1975, when the Vietnam War ended, Fonda returned to work with a new sense of purpose. She wanted to make films that were \"stylistically mainstream,\" she said, \"but with a gender slant.\" Between 1975 and 1988, she starred in thirteen motion pictures, several of which she also co-produced. A partial list includes \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" (1977), \"Julia\" (1977), \"Coming Home\" (for which she was awarded the Best Actress Oscar in 1979), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Nine to Five\" (1980), \"On Golden Pond\" (1981), and the television movie \"The Dollmaker\" (1984), for which she won an Emmy. In those years, she and Hayden also joined forces to support various causes-the returning Vietnam veterans, Native American rights, women's rights. Fonda's activities made her more \"real\" to some fans, but others, including several of her male directors, wished that she would just shut up and act. Joseph Losey, who directed Fonda in a 1973 film version of Ibsen's \"A Doll's House,\" for example, complained that she had \"little sense of humor\" and \"was spending most of her time working on her political speeches, instead of learning her lines.\"\n\nHayden, for Fonda, represented a kind of pure ethics. \"I was both in love with and in awe of Tom,\" she wrote in her autobiography, which meant that she was doubly devastated when Hayden denigrated her work-as he did with \"Coming Home,\" a movie that Fonda both produced and starred in, about a woman torn between a wounded Vietnam vet and her marine husband, who is serving in Vietnam. Hayden felt that the politics in the film were watered down. The more he withheld his approval, the more Fonda tried to earn it. In 1976, he and Fonda founded the Campaign for Economic Democracy, in a close alliance with Governor Jerry Brown. The C.E.D. promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renters' rights. To help support the endeavor, Fonda embarked on what remains one of her best-known projects: the Jane Fonda Workout.\n\nIt began with a fractured foot. Unable to take ballet-her preferred form of exercise for years-Fonda attended a class in Century City that was taught by Leni Cazden, who had developed an exercise technique that toned through repetitive movement, with popular music as an accompaniment. By 1982, Fonda was not only conducting classes on film sets and at her own studio; she had released the first of her workout videos, \"Workout Challenge.\" It was a smash. The tape sold seventeen million copies, making it the most successful how-to video in history. Between 1982 and 1995, Fonda put out twenty-two more videos, five workout books, and twelve audiobooks. \"If you want to trace the changes in American culture over the past twenty years, all you have to do is look at her,\" the Washington Post noted, in 1985. \"She is a lightning rod for a generation whose rhetoric has evolved from Burn, Baby, Burn to Feel the Burn.\"\n\nIn the New Biographical Dictionary of Film, David Thomson writes of Fonda's workout videos, \"Like so many of her films, the tapes were ardent, solemn, and modestly erotic-she was true to herself.\" But it was a self that Hayden no longer wanted to be identified with, even as he benefitted financially. In 1988, he told Fonda that he had fallen in love with another woman.\n\n\"Is it true?\" These were the first words that the media tycoon Ted Turner said to Fonda. Her divorce had just been announced in the press, and Turner wanted a date. Fonda asked him to call back in three months. Turner did-to the day. On their first date, he suggested that Fonda give up her acting career, and, strangely, once she had made the decision to be his wife the urge to perform fell away.\n\nA month after the wedding, Fonda found out that Turner was having an affair. She began a series of cosmetic transformations to win him back: smaller breasts, bigger hair, a wider smile. Although she continued her political work-in 1995, she founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention-her public persona during the decade of her marriage to Turner was that of malleable wife. The members of the women's movement who had rushed to embrace Fonda in the seventies and early eighties mostly distanced themselves from her in these years, criticizing her for having drifted away from her feminist principles. Fonda directs the same criticism at herself, calling her beliefs at that time \"theoretical feminism.\" She told me, \"I can look at Tom now, and Ted, and I can understand why I loved them, and also be totally amazed that I could spend as much time with them as I did. But I've always been in a relationship, and I have never been in a relationship where I could be myself.\" Fonda, however, gained popularity among black women in these years, many of whom found something to identify with both in her struggles with men and in her resilience. \"She's so gangsta,\" the black television host Wendy Williams recently said.\n\nIn preparation for her sixtieth birthday, in 1997, Fonda spent some time making a short film about herself. That process, she said, made clear to her for the first time that she was her own person and not \"just whatever someone wants me to be.\" \"The minute that happened, there were so many things about my marriage that I knew weren't right,\" she said. Two years later, she confronted Turner about his domination of her and told him that he needed to take her needs and feelings into account. \"It took me two years to say that, because I was so scared,\" she said. \"I didn't even know what to ask for before.\" Fonda and Turner were divorced in 2001, and it was around that time that Fonda turned to Christianity. \"After we split up, I could feel myself falling into place,\" she told me. \"I felt a calling. And then I made this discovery. I think it's in Matthew. Jesus is exhorting his disciples, saying to them, 'You must be perfect. You must be perfect.' But in Aramaic he was saying, 'You must be whole. You must be whole.' \" Fonda realized, she said, that she deserved to be treated with respect. \"And when you love someone, and you suddenly realize, Oh, my God, they don't really care, it's just the worst feeling in the whole world.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIt was the same feeling she had come up against as a child. But, in the end, she made a kind of peace with her father, her first absent audience of one. While filming \"On Golden Pond,\" which she co-produced for her father (he won his only Oscar for his work in the film), and in which the Fondas played a father and daughter with a troubled relationship, she deliberately tried to elicit an emotional response from him. \"I saved my touching him for the very last closeup on him,\" she told me. \"I wanted to do something that he didn't expect, because I wanted to have some vulnerability there. And I . . . you can't really see it.\" She had to stop for a moment, choking up. \"I reached out and I said, 'I want to be your friend,' and I could see tears begin, and then he ducked his head and turned away. And that meant the world to me.\" I asked if her father had ever told her he was proud of her. \"He did at the end,\" she said. \"When I was in London promoting my book, I was on one of those shows, and the guy said, 'I'm going to play you something,' and he turned it on, and he had my father talking about me in 'Klute,' and saying how proud he was. He hadn't said it to me, so I heard it for the first time\"-she paused, both laughing and crying-\"while I was being interviewed on television.\"\n\nFonda has also made peace with Turner. In an unfinished \"American Masters\" documentary, directed by Anne Makepeace, for which they were filmed together in 2006, the couple joke:\n\nT URNER : Good God, woman. I was very generous to you. I never took anything from you.\n\nF ONDA : No, you didn't. Just my sanity.\n\nT URNER : But not your vanity.\n\nFonda offers to help Turner find a new girlfriend, \"because I know what you need.\" Turner tells her he'd \"swap a hundred horses for you again.\"\n\nRobin Morgan said of Fonda, \"Jane did power through men. When she became an actress, it was through Vadim. When she became a political figure, it was through Tom. And then she was a philanthropist through Ted. Now she's become the man she wanted to marry!\"\n\nIn 2005, Fonda ended a fifteen-year absence from the screen with her over-the-top performance in \"Monster-in-Law,\" which also starred Jennifer Lopez. \"Oddly enough, that was when I started feeling free,\" Fonda told me. \"It was like, Fuck it, man! And I think it was the ten years with Ted that gave me permission. I watched him and I saw how just letting it all hang out, if you really came from an authentic place-it was O.K. It was this stupid popcorn movie, but that was a liberating film for me.\" She said, laughing, \"Maybe one of the best things about being married to Ted was that I got to play him in a movie!\"\n\n\"Monster-in-Law\" and the lamentable 2007 comedy \"Georgia Rule,\" which co-starred Lindsey Lohan, allowed Fonda to think about acting again. She threw herself into \"33 Variations\" with the intensity of someone embarking on a love affair. \"My technical rehearsals are infamous for being long,\" Moisés Kaufman, who also directed the play, told me. \"I spend a lot of time lighting a show. Sometimes I would be working on a cue and I would see that she was getting tired standing up there in her four-inch heels waiting for me to light her. So I would go to her, 'Jane, you know what, go to your dressing room. I'm going to have somebody else stand there, and when we're done lighting this moment I'll call you back.' \" But she wouldn't go. She'd say, \"Oh, I'm going over my lines. If I need it, I'll tell you.\" Kaufman added, \"We teched that show for seven days. How many times do you think she went to her dressing room? None.\"\n\nFonda said that when she was younger her acting work \"was all primary colors.\" \"Now it's more nuanced,\" she added. \"Anger was always easy. Fear was harder. Nuanced emotions were harder.\" Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation. \"There's a group of men she came up with-Beatty and Redford and so on,\" Thomson said. \"They're trailing away. But I believe Jane might do something really extraordinary and daring. And I think that there's going to be that moment at the Oscars where everybody sort of stands as one when they realize that she's such a part of American history.\"\n\nIn 2010, Fonda wrote a book, \"Prime Time: Love; Health; Fitness; Sex; Spirit; Friendship; Making the Most of All of Your Life,\" which will come out in September. She also wrapped two films to be released later this year-one in France, \"Et Si On Vivait Tous Ensemble?,\" directed by Stéphane Robelin, and one in the States, \"Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding,\" directed by Bruce Beresford, which stars Catherine Keener as a harried, controlling New York lawyer, whose freewheeling mother worships the moon and sells grass out of her home near Woodstock. Although the script is clotted with clichés, Fonda manages to get at something exceptional and true about the ravine that can separate mothers and daughters. The performance has a specificity and a compassion that elevates her character from stock figure to full-blooded living being.\n\nThe night that \"33 Variations\" closed in New York, Fonda, dressed in a checked page-boy cap, a brown-and-white turtleneck, a tightly belted metallic trenchcoat, and dark slacks, presided over the well-wishers who had gathered in her dressing area, including her son Troy and his wife, Simone, and Fonda's current partner, the music producer Richard Perry. She listened in as some young female fans chatted with enthusiasm about what their lives had been like in their twenties. As they talked, Fonda smoothed the front of her coat. Then she took off her glasses and wiped away a bit of perspiration under her left eye. Putting her glasses back on, she said, a trifle brusquely, \"You couldn't pay me to be twenty again.\"\n\nOnstage, the set had been struck. A work light stood near the middle of the stage, casting shadows and glare. Peering out at the empty house, Fonda looked very small. Kaufman put his arm around her shoulder and whispered something in her ear. Fonda looked up at the balcony. And then, with the classic gesture of the travelling actor saying goodbye to another temporary home, she blew a kiss and bowed in the direction of her now phantom audience.\n\nOutside, in the thick late-May air, an enormous crowd stood behind police barricades. A few patrol cars were lined up along the street in front of the theatre. When the crowd spotted Fonda, a great cheer went up, followed by applause. After posing for photographs and signing autographs, Fonda settled into her car, which sped off, escorted by two police cars, their sirens blaring. As the cavalcade crossed Eighth Avenue, it was almost hit by a car heading uptown, which stopped seconds short of disaster. Fonda's daughter-in-law, hearing horns, asked what all the commotion was about. \"Jane,\" her son said. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Queen Jane, Approximately\n\nAugust. The dog days of 2007. The whole world seemed to be wilting. Jane Fonda-the actress, philanthropist, feminist, political activist, model, Christian, blogger, fitness advocate, licensing magnate, and memoirist-impeccable and straight-backed in a light-colored chiffon dress, was attending an outdoor wedding reception in Brooklyn. The groom was Fonda's son, the actor Troy Garity, who had married the actress Simone Bent earlier that day. Before the reception began, Fonda marched over to one of the bar tables, followed by a coterie of younger men. \"I'm the mother of the groom and I need a drink!\" she announced to the startled bartender. She took a sip of her vodka-and-orange-juice and looked around at the crowd, which included her eldest child, the documentary filmmaker Vanessa Vadim, and her youngest, Mary Luana Williams, a park ranger, the child of Black Panthers, whom Fonda had unofficially adopted in the seventies. Then she raised her glass and said, ruefully regarding the proceedings, \"More than my old man did for me.\"\n\nAs the evening progressed, the parents of both the bride and the groom made speeches. Speaking off the cuff, Garity's father, the political activist and politician Tom Hayden, who was Fonda's second husband (neither parent wanted Troy to bear the weight of a famous last name), said that he was especially happy about his son's union with Bent, who is black, because, among other things, it was \"another step in a long-term goal of mine: the peaceful, nonviolent disappearance of the white race.\" Hayden turned the floor over to his ex-wife this way: \"Now Jane wants to say a few words. The new mother-in-law. We know how Jane always becomes the part she's playing. Hopefully, that won't be the case in our son's marriage!\" There was a silence. Fonda had just played Viola Fields, the domineering title character in Robert Luketic's movie \"Monster-in-Law.\" Pulling a sheaf of papers from her purse, Fonda looked concerned, tense. She had written this script herself. She began by apologizing: \"Unlike Tom, who can speak extemporaneously, I have to write everything down.\" For Troy, she continued, Hayden had been \"the parent.\" \"I was usually off making a movie somewhere. Tom was the one who had dinner with Troy every single night.\" Then, referring to her notes, she talked about how Native Americans had once lived where we were now and how her ancestors had sailed from Holland to New York. When the speeches were over, Hayden hugged his son and his new in-laws and rejoined the party, while Fonda, the image of maternal responsibility, went to each of the hundred or so seated guests, shaking their hands and thanking them individually for coming.\n\nAnother role, a different stage. Spring, 2009. This time Fonda was appearing not as a version of herself but as Dr. Katherine Brandt, a musicologist suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, who was gripped by one last question: why did Beethoven, toward the end of his life, devote so much time to composing thirty-three variations on an insignificant waltz written by Diabelli, a composer of no great distinction?\n\nFonda was starring in \"33 Variations,\" by Moisés Kaufman, her first Broadway performance since 1963. Standing motionless in a white spotlight that emphasized her dark hair and gardenia-white skin, she conveyed her character's drama largely through her voice. Her urgent, seductive, imploring tone was recognizable from her innumerable speeches and interviews and forty-odd film performances, which, over the course of half a century or so, set the template for countless actors, writers, and directors interested in depicting the ever-evolving life of the modern American woman. As she performed in Kaufman's play, Fonda didn't so much smash the stage's fourth wall as ignore it. What she communicated, above and beyond the words of the script, was her desire to inhabit her character's lonely imagination.\n\n\"She makes no distinction between the world in which she lives and the work she does on the stage,\" Kaufman said of Fonda. \"The things she learns in one realm help her in the other.\" Although Kaufman had considered other performers, by the time he met Fonda, in New York, in October, 2008, he told me, he knew that he wanted her for the part. \"There are actresses who do emotional wonders, and there are actresses who can do very intelligent roles but are very dry,\" he said. Fonda, he explained, could do both.\n\nBefore their meeting, Kaufman watched a video clip in which Barbara Walters talked about how Fonda got annoyed when people weren't punctual. He arrived an hour early for their seven-o'clock appointment at the Algonquin Hotel. \"At six-forty-five the elevator opens, and it's her,\" Kaufman said. \"And she shakes my hand and says, 'I knew you were going to be on time. Reading your play, I know you're that kind of person. You've done your research.' \" Kaufman went on, \"She ordered a Martini. And then we kept talking. Later, she says, 'You know, two Martinis ago, you said . . .' And I said, 'Jane, you have to do this play. Any woman who measures time by the number of Martinis consumed is somebody I must work with.' \"\n\nOnce \"33 Variations\" closed, after eighty-five performances (Fonda was nominated for a Best Actress Tony), the actress travelled to Los Angeles for knee-replacement surgery. While recuperating, she stayed at the house of a friend, the producer Paula Weinstein. Fonda (who has since moved to L.A.) was then based in Atlanta-in a loft whose entranceway was designed to resemble a vulva. (When Bill Maher talked to Fonda about this on his television program in 2005, he asked her if there was a back way into her home. She invited him over to find out.) Weinstein's house, on the other hand, was a fairly traditional New England-inspired affair, just off Sunset Boulevard, in Beverly Hills, amid split-level houses, dusty palm trees, and lonely, nondescript streets. Fonda's assistant ushered me into the house, and, as two small dogs ran barking toward me, I heard a familiar voice: \"I need you!\" Fonda's command silenced even the dogs, but when I entered the living room she hunched her shoulders and giggled: an actress in need of a director. Her costume for the day was a long-sleeved peach-colored top and a prairie skirt, and she was sitting, with her legs extended, in front of a computer screen. What she \"needed,\" she explained, was for me to help her figure out how to e-mail a document on her new computer. After the problem had been solved, Fonda stood, with the aid of a cane, to show me how her recovery was progressing. \"Isn't it amazing?\" she said, walking back and forth. \"I'm a little sore today, though. I wore high heels last night.\" When I asked why she'd worn heels so soon after her operation, she said, chastened, \"Vanity.\"\n\nFonda sat down. To test my tape recorder, I said, into the microphone, \"This is Hilton Als, observing Jane Fonda.\"\n\nFonda grabbed the mike, delighted to transform the moment into a performance, and said, \"And this is Jane Fonda, who loves being observed.\"\n\nI asked her something I had wanted to ask since her son's wedding: Why had she said that Hayden was \"the parent\"? Hadn't her role as provider for the family made her just as important? She shook her head and pounded her fist on her chest. \"I remember once reading 'Huckleberry Finn' to Troy, after I'd been away shooting a film,\" she said. \"And Troy looked up at me and asked, 'What's the point of having a mother?' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn her best work, Fonda has portrayed women who suffer a kind of spiritual orphanhood, emotionally abandoned by families that were never quite families. \"I felt alone, surrounded by lights\" is how she describes her early days of acting, but it could as easily apply to her childhood. Even her birth name sounds like that of a solitary princess in some dark fairy tale. Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda was the firstborn child of Frances Ford Seymour, a society beauty, and Henry Fonda, the Nebraska-born actor who, as the film historian David Thomson says, \"played some of the most important heroic figures in American film.\" Fonda père was famously critical, perpetually dissatisfied, and notoriously uneasy when it came to dealing with emotion on or off the stage. \"He hated people to cry,\" Jane said. \"I was told when he was rehearsing 'Two for the Seesaw,' with Anne Bancroft, and she had a scene where she would get very emotional, he was so angry that she was actually crying and being emotional he stormed offstage and came back with a mirror and said, 'Look at yourself-it's disgusting.' That kind of vulnerability terrified him.\"\n\nThe director Peter Bogdanovich said that Henry Fonda communicated \"insecurity in just being himself.\" Off-screen, he seems to have spent a substantial amount of time trying to shape his children in his image. In an even-tempered memoir, \"Don't Tell Dad\" (1998), Jane's younger brother, Peter, recalls his father's attempts to transform him. \"I was a skinny little boy,\" he writes. \"It embarrassed Dad, and . . . he did everything he could think of to help me put on weight\"-including feeding his son beer for lunch when he was seven. He sought to mold his daughter's body, too. In her best-selling 2005 memoir, \"My Life So Far,\" she writes, \"Once I hit adolescence, the only time my father ever referred to how I looked was when he thought I was too fat [or] wanted me to wear a different, less revealing bathing suit, a looser belt, or a longer dress.\" Henry also controlled his children by withholding attention and approval. When the thirteen-year-old Fonda fractured five vertebrae in a swimming accident, she didn't tell her father about it for nearly a week, and then he had her stepmother deal with it. When Henry Fonda died, he left nothing to Jane or to Peter. Patricia Bosworth, whose biography \"Becoming Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman,\" will be published in August, told me his will made it clear that he didn't think they needed it.\n\nThe Fonda children wouldn't have felt their father's emotional distance so strongly if their mother had been entirely present. In 1948, when Jane was ten, the family left her childhood home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, so that her father could do theatre work in New York. By then, Frances Fonda had been hospitalized several times for depression. When she wasn't in the hospital, she paced her darkened bedroom in an anxious, distracted manner. Fonda describes their home in those years as \"Charles Addamsy.\" To help relieve Frances's suburban malaise, a New York City friend gave her the keys to her apartment. One night, she woke to find Frances staring down at her neck. \"I was just curious where the jugular vein is,\" she said.\n\nIn the fall of 1949, Henry asked for a divorce. Soon afterward, Frances entered a psychiatric hospital, and by April, 1950, she was dead. Henry persuaded the children's schoolteachers, classmates, and maternal grandmother to tell them that Frances had died of a heart attack. In fact, she had slashed her own throat. Her daughter learned the truth from a movie magazine that one of her classmates slipped her several months after the fact. A former boyfriend remembers that Fonda was always \"puzzled why she didn't feel more about her mother and the fact that she killed herself. I remember her telling me that when she first found out about her mother she just laughed and tried to shut it out. She realized that this was not a normal reaction, that it was a kind of symptom of emotional dishonesty.\" Now, when Fonda discusses her mother, she does so either in a flat, matter-of-fact tone (in her memoir, she writes, \"Mother had killed herself ten months before a new house she'd been building for us was finished. It was April and I guess she couldn't wait\") or in a language that's baroque and unreal (\"My mother? She was a golden thread running through our lives\").\n\nA childhood friend of Fonda's once noted that the gloomier a situation is the more radiant the efficiency with which she responds. (Fonda says that she has a habit of trying to make things better for other people, of wanting to \"smooth out the Kleenex.\") There was something almost competitive about her resilience after Frances's death: My mother chose to die. I will choose the opposite. \"No matter what's going on in your life, there's a part of you that's like radar, that's constantly scanning the horizon,\" Fonda told me. \"And if it picks up any warm body, meaning someone who could give you nurture and direction and support, you glom.\" Fonda was drawn to the mothers of her girlfriends, who could \"tell you what was right and what was wrong and what mattered.\"\n\nAlthough she tended to romanticize the women she encountered, Fonda didn't really want to become one. \"For me, being a woman meant being a victim, being the loser, being the one that'll be destroyed,\" she told me. Bulimia helped her stave off womanhood, at least for a time. In 1952, Fonda was a sophomore at the all-female Emma Willard School, in Troy, New York, where a classmate taught her how to \"gorge and purge.\" (To dine with Fonda is still an interesting experience. She attacks meals with a kind of furious vengeance.) Fonda says that her illness continued for years, and was \"intensified under two conditions: when I was working and had to look good, and when I was in an inauthentic relationship, which I was in a lot.\"\n\nIn 1958, when she was twenty, a recent Vassar College dropout, struggling with depression and living with her father in Santa Monica, Fonda became friends with Susan Strasberg, the daughter of Lee Strasberg, a co-founder of the Actors Studio. Susan pressed Fonda to meet with her father. Although Fonda had performed in a few amateur productions as a student-she had once even shared a summer-stock stage with her father-she didn't feel driven to act until she was admitted to one of Strasberg's New York acting classes. With his encouragement, Fonda came alive. \"I was the most alienated, disembodied person, and I was just kind of going along,\" she said. \"Because it was him, as opposed to my father or someone in the family, I could take it in.\" In Thomas Kiernan's 1973 book, \"Jane: An Intimate Biography of Jane Fonda,\" a fellow-student recalls Fonda's first exercise on Strasberg's stage:\n\nThe class was particularly crowded that day. A lot of people from the other classes had heard about it and were there to see her fall on her face. But she didn't. In fact, she was terrific. You could see this change go through her. The first impression she gave was her nervousness. . . . Then you could see her start to relax and get caught up in it. Pretty soon she was letting it all hang out. Everybody was pretty impressed. Not only with the actor's talent she showed but with her guts. Now that I think back on it, it was inevitable that she be good . . . what with so many people secretly hoping she'd be bad.\n\nFrom the beginning, Fonda was dogged about her craft. \"I felt that I had to prove myself-that it was me and not my father's daughter,\" Fonda told me. \"Everybody would take one class, I'd take four. They'd work on one scene, I'd work on three.\" Her childhood friend the actress Brooke Hayward said, \"Acting gave her the kind of applause she never got as a human being. I've never seen ambition as naked as Jane's.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn Fonda's early performances, the tension between her drive and her desire to be seen as a conventional, unthreatening girl is clear. In her first film, \"Tall Story\" (1960), in which she plays a marriage-minded college cheerleader, she has a stridency that suggests a wildness of character which she herself doesn't want to acknowledge. Fonda was reluctant to admit that she was ambitious-especially not to a man. Good girls raised in the Eisenhower years didn't lift their skirts and reveal their balls. As Fonda began to make a name for herself onstage-in 1960, she was voted the \"most promising actress of the year\" by the New York Drama Critics' Circle for her performance as a rape victim in \"There Was a Little Girl\"-inevitably she attracted the attention of some important figures in the industry. One night, the critic Kenneth Tynan took her out to dinner. \"He asked me, 'What do you want to achieve?' \" Fonda told me. \"And I said, 'I want the audience to accept me.' And he laughed. That was, for him, a glimpse into the fact that I didn't feel like the person that he thought I was. I mean, what a lame answer!\" Around the same time, the director Elia Kazan asked to see Fonda for a film he was casting, \"Splendor in the Grass.\" The interview consisted of Kazan asking Fonda if she was ambitious. She couldn't say yes. Forty years later, still smarting at having lost the part to Natalie Wood, Fonda said, \"You know what I should have said to Kazan? 'Are you kidding? Of course I'm fucking ambitious!' \"\n\nIn \"Tall Story,\" Fonda was an attractive enough ingénue-the studio head, Jack Warner, had insisted that she wear falsies-but she didn't stand out. As Time reported, \"Nothing could possibly save the picture . . . not even a second-generation Fonda with a smile like her father's and legs like a chorus girl.\" Four more bland roles followed-in movies such as \"Period of Adjustment\" (1962) and \"In the Cool of the Day\" (1963)-as well as a searing documentary by D. A. Pennebaker, \"Jane\" (1962), about her experience in the doomed Broadway play \"The Fun Couple,\" which closed after only three performances. (The film shows Fonda at the mercy of her director and sometime lover Andréas Voutsinas, whose approval she clearly longs for, even as her need for self-expression is palpable. \"She wanted the world to know who she was, not the person she was playing,\" Pennebaker told me.)\n\nFonda decided to try her luck in France, where the New Wave movement was in full swing. But before boarding the plane she had a mission. \"I had a long weekend off,\" she recalled, \"and I was obsessed with meeting Henry Miller, so at a hundred and twenty miles an hour I drove to Big Sur to find him.\" She didn't find Miller, but in the Big Sur Hot Springs Lodge (later the site of the Esalen Institute) she got her first taste of the countercultural world that she would later come to represent. She stayed for three weeks and had an affair with the man who ran the lodge. \"I remember the first night I was there, I was in the dining room, and these girls waiting on me had hair under their arms and tie-dyed skirts. I'd never seen hippies. I was so straight. They were having babies in the woods, with goats wandering in and out of their houses, and throwing the I Ching. And I thought, I could stop right here. This is very appealing to me.\" Fonda was torn-as she would be for most of her life-between the reality of her ambition and the romance she found in circles far removed from the one she was born into. \"I had to make a major choice,\" she said. \"This could be my life, and I could stay here, or I could go.\" She went.\n\nWhat she went to was her first onscreen exploration of evil. As the conniving poor relative of a rich pampered woman in René Clément's \"Les Félins\" (1964), Fonda conveys a shimmering narcissism that cuts through the film's synthetic \"artiness.\" The movie tanked, but Fonda was taken up by the French press, which dubbed her \" la B.B. Américaine \"-the American Brigitte Bardot. Undoubtedly, this moniker caught the attention of the director Roger Vadim, who had made Bardot a star with his 1956 film \"And God Created Woman.\" Now Vadim-who was as famous for his amours with Bardot and Catherine Deneuve as for his titillating morality tales-led Fonda to her next incarnation: a mischievous icon who brought an American naïveté and sensibleness to sex in such movies as \"La Ronde\" (1964) and \"Barbarella\" (1968). A cult classic, \"Barbarella,\" with a screenplay co-written by Terry Southern, was based on a soft-core comic strip that had run in the hip, leftist Evergreen Review . Fonda played, as Vadim put it, \"a kind of sexual Alice in Wonderland of the future\" on an interplanetary mission. In the opening scene, she performs a striptease with her armored spacesuit in zero gravity, before landing naked on an orange shag rug. Fonda's wide-eyed incredulity in the role was derided by feminists at the time. Even Fonda now refers to herself at that point in her career as a \"female impersonator.\"\n\nWhile planning their first film together, Fonda and Vadim became involved, and by the time \"La Ronde\" wrapped, Fonda had decided to stay in France. She lived there for six years. Fonda told me, \"Working in French, it's a double mask. There's the mask of playing a character, but then also it's a different language, so I felt really safe.\" Despite her accomplishments, however, she felt disconnected from her public persona. \"What I felt I was and what other people saw were very different things,\" she said. \"I didn't know who I was or what I wanted or where I was going. I had absolutely no confidence in myself. Which is how come Vadim could kind of come along and make something of me.\"\n\nIn 1965, the couple married. \"I cried when we were pronounced man and wife,\" Fonda wrote in her memoir. \"I hadn't realized how much formalizing our relationship would mean to me.\" Fonda wanted to be the perfect wife. (She still says that her ideal woman \"has a child on her hip, and she's stirring pots and she's sipping her wine, and she's funny, and she can turn out a great meal for forty people without losing her sense of humor and without getting stressed.\") But the world kept encroaching. Much of the news of the day came to Fonda via the French actress Simone Signoret, who had become a friend. In 1968, Signoret took Fonda, who had paid scant attention to what was happening in Vietnam, to her first antiwar rally. \"It was all about how horrible America was, and I didn't like it,\" Fonda said. \"I really believed that if we were fighting, there was a reason for it.\" But later that year she read Jonathan Schell's book \"The Village of Ben Suc,\" a report of an attack on a Vietnamese village and its demolition. \"And, you know, it's like everything went flip,\" she said. \"And the world changed.\"\n\nIn the next couple of years, Fonda became a vocal opponent of the war, though she still wasn't convinced that she was smart enough to deal with politics: \"Simone would be talking to me in a very serious and intellectually challenging way, and I always wanted to say, 'Who is that you're talking to? You're not talking to me that way.' I felt that people saw something in me, and it scared me to death, because I didn't see it.\" Fonda's budding activism distanced her from Vadim. Plus, she told me, although being in love with your director can be \"very heady,\" Vadim, while filming \"Barbarella,\" was \"drunk by noon, and it was pretty horrible.\" By the time she returned to the United States, in 1969, with Vadim and their baby, Vanessa, who was born in 1968, Fonda was ready for a change.\n\nNineteen-sixty-nine, in movie theatres around the country: the feature begins. Jane Fonda's hardened, hopeless face fills the screen. A shock of disbelief and then recognition ripples through the audience. How did the actress whom Pauline Kael described as \"that naughty-innocent comedienne\" become so tragic and genuine? When did she put aside her white-girl upper-middle-class privilege and come to embody the reality of womanhood and its marginalization?\n\n\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" is based on Horace McCoy's grim 1935 novel about Depression-era contestants in a marathon dance competition. Fonda's character, Gloria, an aspiring actress who enters the contest, with a chip on her shoulder, and is driven to suicide by the outcome, was described by the Times critic Vincent Canby as a \"Typhoid Mary of existential despair,\" a \"terrified and terrifying heroine.\" Fonda's performance heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Pauline Kael, in her New Yorker review of the film, noted of Fonda:\n\n[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. . . . Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn't try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind \"vulgar\" roles to assure us she's not really like that. . . . Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.\n\nLink copied\n\nWith \"They Shoot Horses,\" Fonda began not only to infiltrate the mainstream as a serious artist but to speak more directly to the margins as well. Her ability to become Gloria was, no doubt, based in part on her jettisoning of another role: wife to Vadim. For the movie, Fonda had to cut the long dyed-blond coif she'd adopted, as she puts it, \"to compete with the wives\"-Vadim's exes. Her new shorn look was a declaration of sorts: personally and professionally, she was moving on.\n\nIn 1971, Fonda was at an antiwar rally at the Fort Lewis military base, alongside a woman who had brought her baby. The woman asked Fonda where her daughter was, and she had to admit that Vanessa was with a nanny in Bel Air. The discrepancy between her life and the lives of the people she was championing made her more and more uncomfortable. \"And I remember I was thinking, O.K., I'm not going to do movies anymore,\" she said. \"But I became friends with Ken Cockrel, who was a black revolutionary lawyer. And he said, 'The revolution needs movie stars. That's a responsibility.' And that's when I started thinking about my career differently: it's about how I do the work, what I choose to do, and, hopefully, taking charge of what I do.\"\n\nBy the time Jane Fonda, at thirty-two, began work on Alan J. Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971), she was becoming, like her character, the author of her own contradictions. Fonda's remarkable portrayal of the call girl and would-be actress Bree Daniels as the embodiment of the alienation of modern life is sociology-free. It's no classroom flick; you watch it, you live it, as people have for decades, largely because Fonda herself is invisible in it. It is Bree alone who allows us into the theatre of her bedroom. The dramatic speech with which she cajoles one of her clients is chillingly erotic:\n\nHas anybody . . . um talked to you about the financial arrangements? Well, it depends naturally on how long you want me for . . . And what you want to do. ( Laugh .) I know you. It will be very nice. Um, well, I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's-if you'd like that? Have you ever been with a woman before? Paying her? Do you like it? I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly. . . . I have a good imagination, and I like pleasing. Do you mind if I take my sweater off? Well, I think in the confines of one's house, one should be . . . free of clothing and inhibitions. Oh, inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome. ( Laugh .) Don't be afraid. I'm not. As long as you don't, uh, hurt me more than I like to be hurt. I will do anything you ask. You should never be ashamed of things like that, I mean you mustn't be. . . . I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to, is to let it all hang out. You know, do it all, and, fuck it.\n\nFonda's Bree has no home but herself, and she doesn't even want to live there very much. Like Louise Brooks's Lulu, the brilliant, self-destructive anti-heroine of G. W. Pabst's \"Pandora's Box\" (1929), she is alone, manipulative, and wise to the nastiness of desire. In their performances, Brooks and Fonda gave a face and a narrative shape to the complex and developing questions of feminism. What does a woman want? Male approval or an identity of her own? Are these desires mutually exclusive? Notably, both Fonda and Brooks created a distinctive \"look\" that served as shorthand for their modernism and their difference: Brooks had the bob, Fonda the shag.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, a few months after \"33 Variations\" closed on Broadway, Fonda was heading from New York to Dallas to participate in a \"media salon\" and fund-raiser for the Women's Media Center, an organization that Fonda started with the feminist writers Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, in 2005. Fonda had invited me along for the trip.\n\nThe stated goal of the Women's Media Center is to encourage the telling of women's stories by women writers. The Dallas event was co-hosted by Trea Yip, an immigrant from China who had made considerable strides since coming to America, as was evident by the palatial size of her home and the fiscal well-being of her guests, who had each been asked to donate at least twenty-five hundred dollars. The dinner was held outside, under a portico, where women with substantial hair and jewels sat chatting at tables. It was a select bunch: well-dressed, well-mannered women, who had done well for themselves or helped their husbands do well, but were no less enthusiastic for that. (The Women's Media Center amusingly acknowledges, in one press release, the various stages that feminism has gone through over the years: \"Every decade, the feminist movement's obituary gets a rewrite, but gender inequality is alive and well!\") Fonda wore a green suit, leopard-skin sandals, and a brilliant blue ring on her right hand. After talking to me for a while, she excused herself, saying, \"I have to figure out who is the richest person here!\"\n\nLater, she circled an area of the living room where a lectern had been set up, testing the space, before the feminist theoretician Helen LaKelly Hunt took the floor. \"How do you introduce someone who's so beloved and so known?\" Hunt said. \"Jane and I bonded when she found out I loved the Scriptures, and that there was a place for us feminists in religion. What can I say except there's starch in her spine and belief in her eyes?\" Fonda embraced Hunt. Crickets chirped and bracelets clattered in the night. Fonda began with a reference to the conservatives in the state. Several sharp intakes of breath could be heard. She persevered. \"They want to get rid of all the gays, all the feminists, and make our country an old-boys' club. The question is, What are we going to do with our boys?\" She paused. Her voice gained momentum. \"We have a toxic masculinity!\"\n\nThe issue of \"toxic masculinity\" hounded Fonda for decades. For instance, when she appeared on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1970, soon after the release of \"They Shoot Horses,\" Cavett introduced her in a characteristically condescending way: \"My next guest is the prettiest member of the flying Fonda family-sounds like a circus act, really, but they are. She's an outspoken lady, as you may know, if you've ever seen Jane Fonda. I remember when she was just a movie star, and now she's . . . lately she's been in the news pages, being arrested for things and all!\" Later in the program, after Fonda spoke passionately about veterans' groups that opposed the atrocities being committed in Vietnam, Cavett interjected, \"Jane is all het up, I see.\"\n\nIn July, 1972, during the height of Fonda's public opposition to the war, she spent two weeks in North Vietnam, as a guest of the Vietnam Committee of Solidarity with the American People. She was carrying more than a hundred letters for American P.O.W.s. She had also agreed to photograph the dikes that held back the waters of the Red River Delta, protecting more than fifteen million Vietnamese peasants from flooding-and which American forces had targeted for bombing. She delivered several broadcasts over Radio Hanoi, in which she addressed U.S. soldiers directly, urging them to \"remain human beings\" and to put an end to the war.\n\nLink copied\n\nDuring the trip, Fonda was photographed sitting on the seat of a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. The response to the image back home was virulent, earning her the nickname Hanoi Jane. After she returned, a man representing what he called the American Liberty League threatened to assassinate her as a \"traitor to the U.S.\" She was publicly denounced by a Maryland state legislator, William J. Burkhead, and in Colorado a state representative, Michael Strang, called her a \"foulmouthed, offensive little Vassar dropout.\" As Mary Hershberger observes, in her book \"Jane Fonda's War\" (2005), \"Almost all of the columnists and reporters who wrote contemptuous reports were male. They usually focused on what she looked like, and seldom on her ideas or the issues she raised. . . . She 'harangued,' she talked too fast . . . she didn't smile enough, she didn't have a sense of humor.\" Fonda attributes the vehemence of the response to both gender and class. \"I was Henry Fonda's daughter. I was privileged. I was Barbarella. They had my posters in their locker rooms. So I betrayed class, I betrayed gender, and I betrayed, you know-you're a pinup girl, you're not supposed to speak. It would have been less pungent if I had been a man.\" She paused, before conceding that having allowed that photograph to be taken \"was the biggest lapse of judgment in my life.\" She added, \"I don't regret going to North Vietnam. I'm glad I went. I'm glad I did everything I did, except that.\"\n\nTom Hayden, a radical from Detroit and one of the founders of the Students for a Democratic Society, was the kind of man Henry Fonda had played in movies-a man of principle, who never failed to fight the good fight-with the added attraction of being working class, which Fonda found sexy. They started seeing each other in 1972. \"I loved his playfulness, the Irish juiciness that brought welcomed moisture to what I felt was my arid, Protestant nature,\" Fonda wrote in her memoir. Plus, Hayden wasn't intimidated by his famous girlfriend; indeed, he pitied her for \"the image of superficial sexiness she once promoted and was now trying to shake,\" he recalled in his 1989 memoir \"Reunion.\" They married in January, 1973, and Troy was born six months later.\n\nIn the spring of 1975, when the Vietnam War ended, Fonda returned to work with a new sense of purpose. She wanted to make films that were \"stylistically mainstream,\" she said, \"but with a gender slant.\" Between 1975 and 1988, she starred in thirteen motion pictures, several of which she also co-produced. A partial list includes \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" (1977), \"Julia\" (1977), \"Coming Home\" (for which she was awarded the Best Actress Oscar in 1979), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Nine to Five\" (1980), \"On Golden Pond\" (1981), and the television movie \"The Dollmaker\" (1984), for which she won an Emmy. In those years, she and Hayden also joined forces to support various causes-the returning Vietnam veterans, Native American rights, women's rights. Fonda's activities made her more \"real\" to some fans, but others, including several of her male directors, wished that she would just shut up and act. Joseph Losey, who directed Fonda in a 1973 film version of Ibsen's \"A Doll's House,\" for example, complained that she had \"little sense of humor\" and \"was spending most of her time working on her political speeches, instead of learning her lines.\"\n\nHayden, for Fonda, represented a kind of pure ethics. \"I was both in love with and in awe of Tom,\" she wrote in her autobiography, which meant that she was doubly devastated when Hayden denigrated her work-as he did with \"Coming Home,\" a movie that Fonda both produced and starred in, about a woman torn between a wounded Vietnam vet and her marine husband, who is serving in Vietnam. Hayden felt that the politics in the film were watered down. The more he withheld his approval, the more Fonda tried to earn it. In 1976, he and Fonda founded the Campaign for Economic Democracy, in a close alliance with Governor Jerry Brown. The C.E.D. promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renters' rights. To help support the endeavor, Fonda embarked on what remains one of her best-known projects: the Jane Fonda Workout.\n\nIt began with a fractured foot. Unable to take ballet-her preferred form of exercise for years-Fonda attended a class in Century City that was taught by Leni Cazden, who had developed an exercise technique that toned through repetitive movement, with popular music as an accompaniment. By 1982, Fonda was not only conducting classes on film sets and at her own studio; she had released the first of her workout videos, \"Workout Challenge.\" It was a smash. The tape sold seventeen million copies, making it the most successful how-to video in history. Between 1982 and 1995, Fonda put out twenty-two more videos, five workout books, and twelve audiobooks. \"If you want to trace the changes in American culture over the past twenty years, all you have to do is look at her,\" the Washington Post noted, in 1985. \"She is a lightning rod for a generation whose rhetoric has evolved from Burn, Baby, Burn to Feel the Burn.\"\n\nIn the New Biographical Dictionary of Film, David Thomson writes of Fonda's workout videos, \"Like so many of her films, the tapes were ardent, solemn, and modestly erotic-she was true to herself.\" But it was a self that Hayden no longer wanted to be identified with, even as he benefitted financially. In 1988, he told Fonda that he had fallen in love with another woman.\n\n\"Is it true?\" These were the first words that the media tycoon Ted Turner said to Fonda. Her divorce had just been announced in the press, and Turner wanted a date. Fonda asked him to call back in three months. Turner did-to the day. On their first date, he suggested that Fonda give up her acting career, and, strangely, once she had made the decision to be his wife the urge to perform fell away.\n\nA month after the wedding, Fonda found out that Turner was having an affair. She began a series of cosmetic transformations to win him back: smaller breasts, bigger hair, a wider smile. Although she continued her political work-in 1995, she founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention-her public persona during the decade of her marriage to Turner was that of malleable wife. The members of the women's movement who had rushed to embrace Fonda in the seventies and early eighties mostly distanced themselves from her in these years, criticizing her for having drifted away from her feminist principles. Fonda directs the same criticism at herself, calling her beliefs at that time \"theoretical feminism.\" She told me, \"I can look at Tom now, and Ted, and I can understand why I loved them, and also be totally amazed that I could spend as much time with them as I did. But I've always been in a relationship, and I have never been in a relationship where I could be myself.\" Fonda, however, gained popularity among black women in these years, many of whom found something to identify with both in her struggles with men and in her resilience. \"She's so gangsta,\" the black television host Wendy Williams recently said.\n\nIn preparation for her sixtieth birthday, in 1997, Fonda spent some time making a short film about herself. That process, she said, made clear to her for the first time that she was her own person and not \"just whatever someone wants me to be.\" \"The minute that happened, there were so many things about my marriage that I knew weren't right,\" she said. Two years later, she confronted Turner about his domination of her and told him that he needed to take her needs and feelings into account. \"It took me two years to say that, because I was so scared,\" she said. \"I didn't even know what to ask for before.\" Fonda and Turner were divorced in 2001, and it was around that time that Fonda turned to Christianity. \"After we split up, I could feel myself falling into place,\" she told me. \"I felt a calling. And then I made this discovery. I think it's in Matthew. Jesus is exhorting his disciples, saying to them, 'You must be perfect. You must be perfect.' But in Aramaic he was saying, 'You must be whole. You must be whole.' \" Fonda realized, she said, that she deserved to be treated with respect. \"And when you love someone, and you suddenly realize, Oh, my God, they don't really care, it's just the worst feeling in the whole world.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIt was the same feeling she had come up against as a child. But, in the end, she made a kind of peace with her father, her first absent audience of one. While filming \"On Golden Pond,\" which she co-produced for her father (he won his only Oscar for his work in the film), and in which the Fondas played a father and daughter with a troubled relationship, she deliberately tried to elicit an emotional response from him. \"I saved my touching him for the very last closeup on him,\" she told me. \"I wanted to do something that he didn't expect, because I wanted to have some vulnerability there. And I . . . you can't really see it.\" She had to stop for a moment, choking up. \"I reached out and I said, 'I want to be your friend,' and I could see tears begin, and then he ducked his head and turned away. And that meant the world to me.\" I asked if her father had ever told her he was proud of her. \"He did at the end,\" she said. \"When I was in London promoting my book, I was on one of those shows, and the guy said, 'I'm going to play you something,' and he turned it on, and he had my father talking about me in 'Klute,' and saying how proud he was. He hadn't said it to me, so I heard it for the first time\"-she paused, both laughing and crying-\"while I was being interviewed on television.\"\n\nFonda has also made peace with Turner. In an unfinished \"American Masters\" documentary, directed by Anne Makepeace, for which they were filmed together in 2006, the couple joke:\n\nT URNER : Good God, woman. I was very generous to you. I never took anything from you.\n\nF ONDA : No, you didn't. Just my sanity.\n\nT URNER : But not your vanity.\n\nFonda offers to help Turner find a new girlfriend, \"because I know what you need.\" Turner tells her he'd \"swap a hundred horses for you again.\"\n\nRobin Morgan said of Fonda, \"Jane did power through men. When she became an actress, it was through Vadim. When she became a political figure, it was through Tom. And then she was a philanthropist through Ted. Now she's become the man she wanted to marry!\"\n\nIn 2005, Fonda ended a fifteen-year absence from the screen with her over-the-top performance in \"Monster-in-Law,\" which also starred Jennifer Lopez. \"Oddly enough, that was when I started feeling free,\" Fonda told me. \"It was like, Fuck it, man! And I think it was the ten years with Ted that gave me permission. I watched him and I saw how just letting it all hang out, if you really came from an authentic place-it was O.K. It was this stupid popcorn movie, but that was a liberating film for me.\" She said, laughing, \"Maybe one of the best things about being married to Ted was that I got to play him in a movie!\"\n\n\"Monster-in-Law\" and the lamentable 2007 comedy \"Georgia Rule,\" which co-starred Lindsey Lohan, allowed Fonda to think about acting again. She threw herself into \"33 Variations\" with the intensity of someone embarking on a love affair. \"My technical rehearsals are infamous for being long,\" Moisés Kaufman, who also directed the play, told me. \"I spend a lot of time lighting a show. Sometimes I would be working on a cue and I would see that she was getting tired standing up there in her four-inch heels waiting for me to light her. So I would go to her, 'Jane, you know what, go to your dressing room. I'm going to have somebody else stand there, and when we're done lighting this moment I'll call you back.' \" But she wouldn't go. She'd say, \"Oh, I'm going over my lines. If I need it, I'll tell you.\" Kaufman added, \"We teched that show for seven days. How many times do you think she went to her dressing room? None.\"\n\nFonda said that when she was younger her acting work \"was all primary colors.\" \"Now it's more nuanced,\" she added. \"Anger was always easy. Fear was harder. Nuanced emotions were harder.\" Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation. \"There's a group of men she came up with-Beatty and Redford and so on,\" Thomson said. \"They're trailing away. But I believe Jane might do something really extraordinary and daring. And I think that there's going to be that moment at the Oscars where everybody sort of stands as one when they realize that she's such a part of American history.\"\n\nIn 2010, Fonda wrote a book, \"Prime Time: Love; Health; Fitness; Sex; Spirit; Friendship; Making the Most of All of Your Life,\" which will come out in September. She also wrapped two films to be released later this year-one in France, \"Et Si On Vivait Tous Ensemble?,\" directed by Stéphane Robelin, and one in the States, \"Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding,\" directed by Bruce Beresford, which stars Catherine Keener as a harried, controlling New York lawyer, whose freewheeling mother worships the moon and sells grass out of her home near Woodstock. Although the script is clotted with clichés, Fonda manages to get at something exceptional and true about the ravine that can separate mothers and daughters. The performance has a specificity and a compassion that elevates her character from stock figure to full-blooded living being.\n\nThe night that \"33 Variations\" closed in New York, Fonda, dressed in a checked page-boy cap, a brown-and-white turtleneck, a tightly belted metallic trenchcoat, and dark slacks, presided over the well-wishers who had gathered in her dressing area, including her son Troy and his wife, Simone, and Fonda's current partner, the music producer Richard Perry. She listened in as some young female fans chatted with enthusiasm about what their lives had been like in their twenties. As they talked, Fonda smoothed the front of her coat. Then she took off her glasses and wiped away a bit of perspiration under her left eye. Putting her glasses back on, she said, a trifle brusquely, \"You couldn't pay me to be twenty again.\"\n\nOnstage, the set had been struck. A work light stood near the middle of the stage, casting shadows and glare. Peering out at the empty house, Fonda looked very small. Kaufman put his arm around her shoulder and whispered something in her ear. Fonda looked up at the balcony. And then, with the classic gesture of the travelling actor saying goodbye to another temporary home, she blew a kiss and bowed in the direction of her now phantom audience.\n\nOutside, in the thick late-May air, an enormous crowd stood behind police barricades. A few patrol cars were lined up along the street in front of the theatre. When the crowd spotted Fonda, a great cheer went up, followed by applause. After posing for photographs and signing autographs, Fonda settled into her car, which sped off, escorted by two police cars, their sirens blaring. As the cavalcade crossed Eighth Avenue, it was almost hit by a car heading uptown, which stopped seconds short of disaster. Fonda's daughter-in-law, hearing horns, asked what all the commotion was about. \"Jane,\" her son said. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Lost Tycoon\n\nEarly last year, Ted Turner seemed invincible. He was the largest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, owning around four per cent of the soon-to-be-merged companies; his celebrated name was on the door of a major division, Turner Broadcasting System; and his dimpled chin, gap-toothed smile, and pencil-thin Gable-esque mustache were recognizable everywhere. His life is documented by the framed magazine covers that crowd the walls of his Atlanta office: Turner in 1976, launching the first \"Superstation,\" by transforming a weak local television signal into a robust cable network; Turner in 1977, skippering his boat, Courageous, to victory in the America's Cup; Turner pioneering the purchase of professional sports teams as cheap and reliable programming; Turner inventing the twenty-four-hour Cable News Network; Turner buying Hollywood film libraries to create new cable-television networks; Turner as Time's Man of the Year.\n\nTed Turner's business successes didn't end when, in 1996, Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner. His influence at the world's largest media company was pervasive; he played the role of crazy-uncle-in-the-basement whose large appetite for cost-cutting has to be appeased, and in the process he helped revive the company's stock. But when, in January of 2000, Time Warner and Turner agreed to join with the Internet company America Online, Turner was not invited to participate in the talks about how the merged company would function.\n\nLess than four months later, Ted Turner was fired. The news, Turner says, was delivered during a telephone call from Gerald Levin, the C.E.O. of Time Warner, who told Turner what Turner had often told others: the company was going to reorganize. Turner Broadcasting would no longer report to Turner but, rather, to Robert Pittman, the chief operating officer of AOL. \"You can't report to Pittman, so you have to have a more senior role,\" Levin remembers telling Turner. As Turner recalls, Levin went on to say, \"Sorry, Ted, but you lose your vice-chairman title as well.\" According to Levin, Turner offered to give up his vice-chairmanship in order to keep running the Turner Broadcasting division, which included CNN, TNT, Turner Classic Movies, the TBS Superstation, the Cartoon Network, the New Line Cinema studio, the Atlanta Braves baseball team, the Atlanta Hawks basketball team, the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team, and Time Warner's HBO. \"I didn't fire Ted,\" Levin insists today. \"I said, 'This is the way we need to run the company.'\"\n\nTurner protested, in a series of calls first to Levin, then to Steve Case, the C.E.O. of AOL, who was to be the chairman of the new company, demanding that he not be deprived of supervision of CNN and the other cable networks that he had started. He thought that he would prevail, and in early May-perhaps because he, like Levin, hates confrontation, or perhaps because making speeches has become his accustomed mode of communication and he had now spoken-Turner got on his plane and headed for New Mexico, where he owns a five-hundred-and-eighty-thousand-acre ranch, and where he had invited some friends to join him. Turner is America's largest individual landowner, with nearly two million acres, or the rough equivalent of the land area of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. He owns twenty-two properties, in nine states and Argentina, and he spends about half his time at one or another of them.\n\nTurner didn't see that his travels often slowed decision-making at Turner Broadcasting. Although he entrusted most matters to a deputy, Terence F. McGuirk, he expected to approve major projects himself. AOL and Time Warner executives, however, were impatient with the peripatetic Turner. He is sixty-two, and even his friends wanted him to slow down. Jane Fonda, his former wife, thinks that she knows why he is so restless: \"I say this with all the love in the world. . . . He has been severely, hauntingly traumatized. He always thinks something is about to be pulled out from him. He has no belief in permanency and stability. It's one reason why I'm not with him. Older age is about slowing down and growing vertically, not horizontally. That's not Ted.\"\n\nSomething was \"pulled out\" from Turner while he was in New Mexico, as he learned from a five-page fax that he received there. The fax, a press release issued by AOL Time Warner, announced a new management team for the company, awarding Turner one of two vice-chairmanships and \"the additional title of Senior Advisor.\" The fax did not say that he had lost much of his authority, or that his five-year contract to manage Turner Broadcasting had been abrogated a year early. John Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media and an old friend of Turner's, who was a guest at the ranch, recalls that when the fax arrived \"Ted went white. He was very upset. He thought it was extremely bad behavior for them to do it that way.\" Malone told Turner, \"You can sue, but you won't get your job back. You'll just get money.\"\n\nTurner's bosses tried to defuse the publicity with praise. At a press luncheon for CNN's twentieth anniversary, four weeks after the announcement, Case told reporters, \"Ted Turner has been a hero of mine for twenty-five years, and he and I are basically going to be joined at the hip.\" Turner can be seduced with kind words, with pleas to work for the good of the team, but he wasn't this time. \"'Vice-chairman' is usually a title you give to somebody you can't figure out what else to do with,\" he says. He likened himself to a monarch.\n\nTurner says that last year was one of the most miserable of his life. His marriage to Fonda ended, after eight years, and this, too, was announced in January. In addition, he smashed his foot in a skiing accident; his beloved black Labrador, Chief, contracted coonhound disease and was temporarily paralyzed; his back hurt and he thought that he needed surgery; and two of his grandchildren were diagnosed with Hurler's syndrome, a rare and sometimes lethal enzyme deficiency. Most adults have the support of a spouse and family, friends, and a job; Turner didn't have a spouse, had never had intimate friends, and no longer ran his own company. \"I felt like Job,\" Turner told me, adding, not for the first time, that he had felt \"suicidal.\"\n\nYet Turner has, in the past several years, been commanding more attention outside his company, making a new identity for himself as a philanthropist-\"I want to be Jiminy Cricket for America,\" he has said. In 1997, before it was fashionable for billionaires to make such gifts, he pledged a billion dollars to the United Nations. The Turner Foundation, which he controls, awarded fifty million dollars last year to environmental causes. (Turner is a devoted environmentalist-he can name every species of bird and animal on his ranches-and during the oil embargo of 1973 he sold his Cadillac and switched to more fuel-efficient cars; recently, he exchanged his Ford Taurus for a hybrid electric-and-gas Toyota Prius, which averages about fifty miles a gallon.) Last year, Turner started a foundation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, whose goal is to curb the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and he has pledged two hundred and fifty million dollars over the next five years. In December, to solve a long-running dispute between what the United States owed the United Nations and what Congress was willing to pay, Turner joined Richard C. Holbrooke, then the Ambassador to the U.N., to shape an extraordinary compromise: Turner would contribute the thirty-four-million-dollar difference, and the U.N. would adjust its future dues formula.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner calls himself \"a do-gooder.\" He says so in a loud voice, and it gets louder as he gets excited. Turner is uninhibited, and is usually blissfully unaware of others; for one thing, he is hard of hearing and is too vain to use a hearing aid. \"Half the people alive today are already living in what we would consider intolerable conditions,\" he declares. \"One-sixth don't have access to clean drinking water; one-fifth live on less than a dollar a day; half the women in the world don't have equal rights with men; the forests are shrinking; the temperature's rising, and the oceans are rising, because of the melting of the ice cap.\" He sounds like a billionaire Jeremiah. In a hundred years, he believes, New York will be under water and it will be \"so hot the trees are going to die.\" He continues, \"It will be the biggest catastrophe the world has ever seen-unless we have nuclear war.\" He is outraged that the United States and others don't do more to alleviate these horrors and to combat the defense and foreign policies of George W. Bush. \"The new Administration attempts to make enemies out of the Russians, the North Koreans, and the Chinese to justify the gigantic military buildup it wants to make in peacetime,\" he says. \"The economy of North Korea is smaller than the economy of Detroit!\" And he is disturbed by the world's exploding population; although he has five children, he once declared, \"If I was doing it over again, I wouldn't have had that many, but I can't shoot them now that they're here.\"\n\nTurner's contradictions are as clear as his views. He successfully opposed unionization at his company, yet he rails against élites. He has called himself \"a socialist at heart\" and a fiscal \"conservative.\" Turner speaks out on behalf of the rights of women but refuses to denounce Islamic states that suppress women's rights. He has compared Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Fox network, to Hitler, yet when he is asked if he thinks Saddam Hussein is evil he says, \"I'm not sure that I know enough to be able to answer that question.\" And though he preaches tolerance, he has uttered some intolerant words; for example, on Ash Wednesday, seeing the black smudge on the foreheads of some CNN staff members, he asked them whether they were \"Jesus freaks.\" As he frequently does when he says something unwise, Turner apologized, blithely assuming that the furor would pass. It did. A week later, Turner told me, \"That's the downside of speaking spontaneously.\"\n\nTurner has two offices, in New York and Atlanta, and they seem to capture the odd mixture of his views: in his New York office, which is nearly bare, a bust of Alexander the Great peers from a shelf, while the Atlanta office, which is vast and crammed with trophies and artifacts, features busts of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Gandhi. \"I've gone from a man of war to a man of peace,\" Turner explains. He offers the Turner principle of world diplomacy: \"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\"\n\nDespite Turner's success, people who meet him often think that he is peculiar. They hear his piercing laugh and the long \"Ahhhhhhhhh\"s he utters as he pauses between words or thoughts, which veer off in surprising directions, and they have no other explanation. A former director of Turner Broadcasting's board who counts himself a friend and a fan describes Turner as a fascinating amalgam of opposites: \"He's a mixture of a genius and a jackass. I think Ted could have run for President of the United States-if there were not the jackass side.\"\n\nThe \"jackass side\" of Turner appears because, he himself says, \"I don't have any idea what I'm going to say. I say what comes to my mind.\" Gerald Levin puts this in the best light: \"Ted is by far the most interesting person I've ever met-how he reacts to things. It's as if a child were speaking, without any social inhibitions. You don't say in business, 'I got fired.' He'll just speak out loud what may be going through someone's mind, and he'll say it to everybody. I think that's a beautiful characteristic. He's angelic. The whole world is socially constrained. I love and respect this about Ted, but for other people it may be very difficult.\"\n\nIn November of 1996, for instance, the Friars Foundation honored Turner at a lifetime-achievement black-tie dinner. After he received his award and made a short speech, the lights dimmed, and then, as various entertainers, including the comedian Alan King, prepared to roast him, Turner, who insists on getting to bed early, grabbed Fonda's arm and departed, leaving the crowd gasping and King bellowing, \"Rupert Murdoch was right-you are nuts.\"\n\nOn other occasions, humor redeems the situation. In January of 1999, Turner was invited to address the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin. Eason Jordan, who oversaw international coverage for CNN, had briefed Turner on what he shouldn't say to his audience, made up largely of Germans. Nevertheless, Jordan recalls, the CNN staff was nervous, because Turner had said, \"I'll wing it.\" And he did.\n\n\"You know, you Germans had a bad century,\" Turner declared. \"You were on the wrong side of two wars. You were the losers.\" He continued, \"I know what that's like. When I bought the Atlanta Braves, we couldn't win, either. You guys can turn it around. You can start making the right choices. If the Atlanta Braves could do it, then Germany can do it.\" The audience laughed with Turner, not at him. He left the podium to a standing ovation.\n\nTurner likens himself to Zorba the Greek: \"I lose my self-restraint and . . . just get up and dance sometimes.\" Gail Evans, a senior executive at Turner Broadcasting, says that Turner is always \"winking,\" and she recalls the time he asked her to take the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau to lunch: \"Go buy Mr. Cousteau a tuna-fish sandwich!\" Today, associates are not laughing; they speak of Turner in the past tense, offering epitaphs. \"He's the last of the revolutionary and creative minds in our business,\" CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, who joined the company in 1983, says. \"The idea of twenty-four-hour news and global news is his creation. That's changed the world. It's changed people's relations with their governments. It's meant that governments can no longer crack down with impunity on protests. And Ted's business also had a human face and a moral face and a social face. It wasn't just about making money and building an empire.\" She adds, sadly, \"He's been shunted aside.\"\n\nEven Turner talks about himself in a retrospective cadence: \"My business side is coming to a close. It's time for me to move on, anyway.\" Last May, after AOL and Time Warner announced the new management structure, Robert Pittman tried to debunk press speculation that Turner was unhappy, saying, \"I think Ted's going to have more influence than he had before.\" Now Pittman, who was born in Mississippi and has spent weekends hunting with Turner, says, \"For me, Ted has a very big role. I don't make major decisions about Turner Broadcasting without talking to Ted.\" This is not what Turner thinks. \"They tell me I have moral authority, and that's great,\" he says. He looks down at his tie, which is decorated with orange bison, and goes on to say, wistfully, \"I'm very busy. Over the last three to four years, I've created another life for myself, and even if they had offered me the chairmanship of the company I probably wouldn't have taken it. It would require all my time, and I'd have to move to New York and I don't want that. I've got this other stuff that I think is in many ways more important.\"\n\nIn March, Turner's business influence was further diminished when the parent company announced that his top lieutenants at Turner Broadcasting-Terence McGuirk, the chairman and C.E.O., and Steven J. Heyer, the president-would be replaced by Jamie Kellner, the chief executive and founder of the WB broadcast network. To achieve more of the company's much touted synergies, Turner Broadcasting would be folded into a combined broadcast-and-cable-television division, which would be run by Kellner; Kellner would move to Atlanta from Hollywood. In a press release, Turner applauded Kellner's promotion. He was pleased that the separate fiefdoms in his old company and Time Warner would be joined-he blames Levin for wanting \"to keep everybody weak, so he could be stronger\"-but sorry that AOL Time Warner was practicing what he thinks of as management by the numbers.\n\nSince Turner's dismissal, his offices, at the CNN Center, in Atlanta, and at Time Warner's headquarters, at 75 Rockefeller Plaza, have been largely idle. Friends notice that his shoulders slope more, that his hair has turned white, that his hearing is worse, that he complains about pain in his back and his foot, that he is self-conscious about his age. His energy level has decreased, along with his business authority. He is a member of the company's official executive committee, but it meets just once a month; the core corporate executive committee meets for lunch every Monday without him.\n\nLink copied\n\nStill, the needy side of Turner compels him to want to please. Before an Advertising Council dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria last November in honor of Turner and Levin, Turner stood awkwardly beside Levin in a receiving line. As they turned to enter the ballroom, Turner pointed to me and told Levin that I was writing about him. Levin said he knew, and that prompted Turner to reassure him: \"I checked first with corporate communications. I would not have done this unless I had approval.\" Such behavior does not surprise Jane Fonda. Turner is insecure, she says, noting that the man who thinks of himself as Rhett Butler is really the more vulnerable character in his favorite movie: \"He loves 'Gone with the Wind' for lots of reasons, and one of them is that he identifies with Scarlett O'Hara.\"\n\nRick Kaplan, who was fired as president of CNN/U.S. last September, recalls being taken to lunch by Turner at a Southern-kitchen restaurant, where \"you thought you were walking in with Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium.\" For the first time, Kaplan noticed, Turner talked mostly about the past: \"Whenever I had spent any time with him, he'd always talk about the future. All of a sudden, gone from his conversation were dreams for the future. And he was supposed to be there to make me feel better. Instead, I left feeling worse for him. I spent more time telling him positive, uplifting things, telling him the truth-that people revere him and it doesn't matter what his title is and it doesn't matter what anyone says his responsibilities are. Ted could sell all his stock, divest himself of every nickel he's got, and if he walked into the CNN newsroom the place would stand at attention.\"\n\nPerhaps, but in the new world of AOL Time Warner it is probably not premature to write Ted Turner's business obituary.\n\nThe first word that Robert Edward Turner III uttered was not \"mama\" or \"dada\" but \"pretty.\" It was an odd choice, since he also remembers that, growing up in the shadow of the Second World War, he yearned first to be a fighter pilot with the R.A.F., and then to conquer the world, like his first hero, Alexander the Great. Turner was born in 1938 in Cincinnati; a sister, Mary Jane, was born three years later. His father, Robert Edward (Ed) Turner, Jr., ran a successful outdoor-advertising company. Ted's mother was a dutiful wife, who tried to obey her husband's wishes. Ed Turner was a charming, gifted salesman who was on the road or at work far more than he was at home. He was propelled by the memory of his own father, a cotton farmer in Mississippi, who lost his farm in the Depression and, refusing to declare bankruptcy, became a sharecropper instead. Often, Ed Turner would warn his son that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman were Communists and that the Communists would take over America and execute anyone with more than fifty dollars in his pocket. For years, Ted never carried around more than forty-nine dollars.\n\nTed was obstreperous. He pulled ornaments off the Christmas tree, and smeared mud on a neighbor's sheets that were hanging out to dry. His father instructed him to read two books each week, and to eat every vegetable on his plate. Ed was often drunk, and would fly into a rage when Ted disobeyed; he frequently beat him, sometimes with a wire coat hanger. He would untwist it until it was straight, like a whip, and then hit his son, exclaiming, \"This hurts me more than it does you.\" When this didn't seem to tame Ted, he reversed the punishment, pulling down his pants, lying down, and ordering his son to administer the lashings. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Ted obeyed. \"It was the most painful thing I ever did in my entire life,\" he recalls, giving his father credit for understanding that \"that would be a more effective punishment than him beating me.\"\n\nApparently, it was not effective enough; when Ed Turner joined the Navy, during the Second World War, and was assigned to the Gulf Coast, the family joined him-except for young Ted, who stayed with his grandmother and was eventually sent to boarding school in Cincinnati. Ted was miserable; he was impossible to control, and was suspended. When he was about ten, the family moved to Savannah, Georgia. Intent on teaching his son obedience, Ed Turner became more formal, no longer hugging him but greeting him with a handshake. He sent Ted off to the Georgia Military Academy, outside Atlanta, and then to the military program at the McCallie School, in Chattanooga.\n\nTed read non-stop, committing poems and military history to memory, but he hated boarding school. \"I was hurt,\" he told me. \"I didn't want to go off so young. It was like a prison. You couldn't leave the campus. There was a bell when you got out of bed in the morning and a bell to go to meals, and a bell to go to bed at night.\" And, he added, \"there were no parents there-no mom, no dad.\" Yet Turner defends and even romanticizes his harsh father, saying that he deliberately instilled insecurity: \"He thought that people who were insecure worked harder, and I think that's probably true. I don't think I ever met a superachiever who wasn't insecure to some degree. A superachiever is somebody that's never satisfied.\"\n\nBy the time he was a teen-ager, Ted knew that he did not want to join his father's business. He was religious, and he decided that he was going to be a missionary. Then his sister became ill. He was fifteen when Mary Jane, who was twelve, contracted systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's tissue. She was racked with pain and constantly vomiting, and her screams filled the house. Ted regularly came home and held her hand, trying to comfort her. He prayed for her recovery; she prayed to die. After years of misery, she succumbed. Ted lost his faith. \"I was taught that God was love and God was powerful,\" he says, \"and I couldn't understand how someone so innocent should be made or allowed to suffer so.\"\n\nThe experience transformed Turner. \"I decided I wanted to be a success,\" he says. Though he wasn't much of an athlete, he became a good boxer; the same tenacity that enabled him to resist his father helped him in boxing, because, he recalls, \"I could take punishment.\" To impress his father, he took up debating and excelled at it; as a senior, he won the state high-school debating championship. He also became an accomplished sailor.\n\nEd Turner was constantly giving his son instructions: where he should work during the summers, whom he should date, how he had to save to pay his college tuition. When Ted was at home, his father even charged him room and board. Expecting his son to attend Harvard, he was displeased when a rejection letter arrived. Ted was accepted at Brown, and that mollified his father, but not for long. According to a detailed account of Ted's Brown years in Robert and Gerald Jay Goldberg's \"Citizen Turner,\" he wasn't much of a student. He gambled. He got into noisy arguments, defending the South, defending war as a means of ridding the planet of the weak, defending nationalism. He delighted in irritating liberal sensibilities. He kept a rifle in his room, and sometimes poked it out the dormitory window and fired off a round or two. He partied and drank too much. He talked about dates as if he were describing military conquests. But Ted could be charming and funny, and, as is still the case, he was hard to miss. He joined the Brown sailing team, and was named the best freshman sailor in New England.\n\nHis father, who had divorced Ted's mother in 1957 and was now remarried, tried, in his son's word, to \"micromanage\" his life, to treat college as preparation for a business career. When Ted chose to major in classics, his father wrote angrily:\n\nI am appalled, even horrified, that you have adopted Classics as a Major. As a matter of fact, I almost puked on the way home today. . . . I am a practical man, and for the life of me I cannot possibly understand why you should wish to speak Greek. With whom will you communicate in Greek? I have read, in recent years, the deliberations of Plato and Aristotle, and was interested to learn that the old bastards had minds which worked very similarly to the way our minds work today. I was amazed that they had so much time for deliberating and thinking and was interested in the kind of civilization that would permit such useless deliberation. . . . I suppose everybody has to be a snob of some sort, and I suppose you will feel that you are distinguishing yourself from the herd by becoming a Classical snob. I can see you drifting into a bar, belting down a few, turning around to a guy on the stool next to you-a contemporary billboard baron from Podunk, Iowa-and saying, \"Well, what do you think about old Leonidas?\" . . . It isn't really important what I think. It's important what you wish to do with the rest of your life. I just wish I could feel that the influence of those odd-ball professors and the ivory towers were developing you into the kind of man we can both be proud of. . . . I think you are rapidly becoming a jackass, and the sooner you get out of that filthy atmosphere, the better it will suit me.\n\nLink copied\n\nAgitated by the letter, Ted brought it to the Brown student newspaper, the Daily Herald , and, as Porter Bibb says in his biography \"Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy As It Looks,\" the paper published it anonymously.\n\nIn his junior year, Ted was expelled for smuggling a coed into his room. In fact, it was just the last straw, and, if Ed Turner was unhappy with his son's behavior, he was glad to have him come home and enter the billboard business. Despite their feuds, Ted now rarely questioned that he would work for his father. \"I liked the advertising business,\" he said. Father and son were similar in many ways. Both were persuasive and headstrong. Both viewed seduction as a game of conquest. Both were self-centered. Both were political conservatives. Both liked whiskey. Both battled moments of depression. And both had unsuccessful marriages.\n\nIn 1960, after a brief stint in the Coast Guard, Ted married Julia (Judy) Gale Nye, the daughter of a prominent sailor from Chicago, and they moved to Macon. A year later, when she gave birth to Laura Lee, Ted, intent on winning the America's Cup, was off sailing. Marriage did not stop him from carousing, and he often returned home late at night, as if in a Playboy cartoon, with lipstick on his collar and alcohol on his breath. Two years after they were married, Judy filed for divorce. Then she discovered that she was pregnant again, and the couple reconciled. In May of 1963, Robert Edward Turner IV was born. Ted soon returned to his earlier habits, and finally, after a sailing competition in which he rammed his wife's boat in order to win, Judy decided that the marriage was finished.\n\nTurner was a Barry Goldwater supporter, and he met his second wife, Jane Smith, who was a stewardess based in Atlanta, at a campaign rally. They married in June of 1964, and had three children in short order-Rhett, Beauregard, and Jennie. In 1967, Ted also got custody of the two children from his first marriage. The Turners lived in Atlanta, and Ted was not much better as a father than he was as a husband. He was \"a dictator,\" Laura, who is now close to her father, recalls. Because of the sailing season, he was rarely home for Christmas, and because of work the family took few vacations together. In the summer, because Turner refused to install air-conditioning, the family baked. But, Ted says, recalling his own father, \"I treated my children entirely differently than he did. I let them make a lot of their decisions for themselves.\" Yet he had sudden mood changes, and his temper frightened the children. They were expected to be in bed by 8 P . M . and at breakfast before eight. Good manners were required at the table. Television was limited. If they wanted soda or candy on the weekend, they collected empty bottles to earn the money.\n\nWhile Ted Turner concentrated on mastering the outdoor-advertising business, his father was trying to escape depression; he drank, smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, and took a huge assortment of pills. In 1961, Ed Turner had sought treatment, and he spent a summer at the Silver Hill psychiatric hospital, in New Canaan, Connecticut. A year after he left Silver Hill, Ed Turner made the boldest business decision of his career, paying four million dollars for the Atlanta, Richmond, and Roanoke divisions of General Outdoor Advertising. Instantly, Turner Advertising was the foremost outdoor-advertising company in the South.\n\nTed was convinced that they had scored a coup. His father, though, was strangely morose, worrying that he lacked the resources to absorb such a large company. He returned to Silver Hill, and from there placed a panicky call to a friend in the outdoor-advertising business and pressed him to buy the new divisions for the amount they had cost him. The friend, not wanting to take advantage, threw in a fifty-thousand-dollar bonus. Ed Turner still could not shake his depression. \"I don't want to hurt anybody. I just feel like I've lost my guts,\" he wrote to his wife. On March 5, 1963, Ed Turner had breakfast with his wife, went upstairs, placed a .38-calibre silver pistol in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. He was fifty-three.\n\nHis son later told Christian Williams, who wrote an early biography of him, that he and his father \"had terrible, terrible fights. It was after one of those fights-we disagreed about how the business should be run-that he blew his brains out.\" The message was clear: Ed Turner abandoned his dreams of business glory because he felt inadequate, and because his son wasn't up to the task, either. The son, who was twenty-four, had to face another message: perhaps he was responsible. For all that, Ted Turner says that he lost his \"best friend.\"\n\nIn the weeks and months after his father's suicide, Turner was distraught yet surprisingly focussed. He told his father's advisers and bankers that Ed Turner had not known what he was doing when he resold the company divisions he had just bought; that he, Ted, would sue if necessary to reclaim them; and that, in any case, he was prepared to run the entire enterprise. His ferocity and his mastery of the numbers were impressive. The bankers came through with the loans, and his father's friend sold back the divisions he had bought.\n\nSoon after that, Turner began to dream of going beyond the billboard business, of building a media empire. His first venture came five years after his father's suicide, in 1968, when he bought a Chattanooga radio station, WAPO. Within a year, he had also acquired radio stations in Jacksonville and Charleston. In 1970, he acquired his first television property, Channel 17 in Atlanta, a money-losing UHF station. He borrowed heavily to make the purchase, and the consensus was that he had been outsmarted; although he changed the station's call letters from WJRJ to WTCG, it looked as if he would lose everything. \"Working in UHF television at that time was like being in the French Foreign Legion,\" recalls Terry McGuirk, who was hired by Turner the summer after his junior year at Middlebury College, and who became Turner's protégé. The staff consisted of about thirty employees; for many, the pay was thirty dollars a week and all you could eat. The finances became even more dire when Turner acquired a second TV station, in Charlotte. McGuirk, who was dispatched to sell ads, says that the new station was costing Turner fifty thousand dollars a month. And a good deal of the time Turner was away sailing, a hobby that commanded nearly as much of his attention as business did. But he managed to motivate his tiny staff, just as he did his sailing crew.\n\nTurner charmed and wheedled to get ads, and he introduced inexpensive programming. News was alien to the man who would become identified with CNN-too negative, Turner complained-and at first it was aired only in the early-morning hours. Turner programmed \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and Three Stooges movies and every sports event he could find. Although profits were slim, he became obsessed with broadcasting. He wanted a national network, and, since he couldn't afford a broadcast network (there were none for sale, anyway), he discovered a way to get one on the cheap. In 1975, Gerald Levin, of Home Box Office, which was then a regional cable service, owned by Time Inc., that offered movies to subscribers, decided that he could transform HBO into a national pay-TV network by distributing it over the newly launched RCA satellite: all he had to do was get cable operators to invest a hundred thousand dollars in a thirty-foot dish. At the time, broadcast-TV stations like Turner's Channel 17 relied on microwave signals that bounced off transmission towers. Turner, however, had a tower that was twice the height of most other such towers, and his station already reached beyond its broadcast range, of forty miles, to five states. But a network of towers was expensive, and the signals were impeded by tall buildings and deteriorated over long distances.\n\nClockwise from top right: Turner with his first wife, Judy Nye; his second wife, Jane Smith; and his father.\n\nCable had other advantages: unlike broadcasting, which produced revenue solely from advertising, it had monthly subscription charges. But cable in those days had little programming of its own; it had started as a way to improve TV reception, and then became a way to extend television to rural communities that didn't get broadcast signals. Turner saw an opportunity. With satellites, as HBO had demonstrated, signals could be sent across the nation, and so Channel 17 could become a cable network. He renamed the new network TBS-Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nTurner was taking not only a huge business risk-he borrowed heavily-but a political risk, too, since he needed approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The broadcast networks and the local TV stations were implacably opposed. They were joined by the Hollywood studios, which complained that Turner would be paying a local price for their movies and exhibiting them nationally, and by professional sports teams, which said that Turner was stealing their product.\n\nTurner and others in the cable industry saw the broadcast networks and their allies as a cartel that had induced the government to impose regulations crippling cable's ability to compete. Cable conventions at that time were like revival meetings, with speaker after speaker fervently denouncing this satan. As a master salesman, Turner knew that Congress had long been concerned about the pervasive power of Hollywood and the three big New York-based broadcast networks, and he assured congressional leaders that he, a broadcaster, was trying to help the nascent cable industry provide consumers with more choices-and better choices, too, since his station would not, he vowed, program violent, sexually explicit movies, like Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver.\" Of course, viewers would not be receiving first-class alternative fare, since Turner was offering movies and sports in the evening and \"Lassie,\" \"The Munsters,\" and \"The Flintstones,\" among other programs, during the day. Nevertheless, the F.C.C. allowed tiny Channel 17 to become the Superstation, an overnight rival to the networks.\n\nCable was starved for programming, and TBS and HBO became its building blocks. To insure continuous baseball coverage that could not be taken off his Superstation, Turner, in 1976, bought the Atlanta Braves; although he paid a bargain price of ten million dollars, he went into debt to do it. He attended most Braves home games: he ran out onto the field to lead the fans in \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\"; sitting behind the Braves dugout, he'd spit Red Man tobacco juice into a cup and swill beer, in hot weather peeling off his shirt; when a Brave hit a home run, he'd jump over the railing and rush to the plate to greet him; he played cards with his players and insisted that they call him Ted. Ralph Roberts, the founder of Comcast Communications, which is now the nation's third-largest cable company, says of TBS, \"We thought it was the greatest thing in the world.\" Roberts was charmed by Turner; others were not. Turner would drop to the floor, histrionically, to beg for business; once, telling a roomful of Southern ladies how to woo advertisers, he explained, \"My daddy said, 'If advertisers want a blow job, you get down on your knees.' \"\n\nHe became Captain Outrageous. Celebrating his victory in the 1977 America's Cup, he swigged almost a whole bottle of aquavit that had been given to him by the Swedish team, and then, drinking champagne, pulled his shirt up to his neck and yelled at some nearby women, \"Show me your tits!\" Earlier that same year, his second as a team owner, the baseball commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, suspended him for the season, accusing him of tampering when he tried to sign a player who was under contract to another team.\n\nTurner tales became legendary. While racing in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1978, Turner coaxed the French-born Frédérique D'arragon-then, as now, a girlfriend-to wait until their boat came to the reviewing stand and then jump naked into the water. Jimmy Carter remembers that when he became President, in 1977, he invited his fellow-Georgian to state dinners. \"He was very raucous,\" Carter said. \"He was loud, and he interrupted sedate proceedings.\" Carter was amused by Turner. Dick Cavett, on the other hand, was not. During a taping of his television show, Cavett pressed him: \"You are a colorful, boisterous, sometimes inebriated playboy type. Maybe it's an act or it's created by the press, but that is your image. You wouldn't deny that, would you?\"\n\n\"I have heard that you are a little twinkle-toed TV announcer,\" Turner responded. \"Would you deny that?\"\n\nBy the late seventies, Turner was rich, and although he still behaved in unconventional ways, he had become more serious. He had great respect for Jimmy Carter, and no doubt Carter's more liberal views affected Turner's own politics. He began to liken himself to \"an ambassador for good will.\" He saw himself as a rabbit-\"a rabbit that's small and fast. All my big competitors were like a pack of wolves, and they were all chasing me, but I was fast enough to be out in front of them.\" The emblem of the rabbit was Turner's brand-new Cable News Network.\n\nReese Schonfeld, a creative and prickly executive, had discussed the cable-news-channel idea with Turner in 1978, and he served as CNN's first president. Turner, who was generous with his money but cheap in sharing credit with Schonfeld, told cable operators that CNN would do for the cable industry what Edward R. Murrow and Huntley-Brinkley had done for network news. CNN would make news the star, not overpaid anchors, and it would not be clotted with ads. Schonfeld travelled the country to sign up cable operators. And at most cable conventions there was Ted Turner, to make a speech and inspire his cable army.\n\nThe new cable network, based in Atlanta, made its official début on June 1, 1980, with three military bands striking up music and a nervous Ted Turner standing at a lectern in a blue blazer. Sporting Elvis sideburns, he began by reciting \"a little poem that was written by Ed Kessler,\" and that reflected CNN's mission: \"To act upon one's convictions while others wait, to create a positive force in a world where cynics abound, to provide information to people when it wasn't available before.\" A band played \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and when it ended Turner whooped \"Awww-riiight!\" and CNN went live.\n\nCNN's production values were initially amateurish-\"video wallpaper,\" or \"talking heads,\" network news executives sneered-and ratings were poor. Most of the work of building a staff, imposing news values, and winning clearance from local cable operators was taken on by Schonfeld. But Turner was the galvanizer, the risk-taker. He practically lived in his office, hurrying through the newsroom and rarely spending more than thirty seconds with anyone. Nick Charles, a sports reporter who was one of the first people to be hired at CNN, recalls that most of the staff worked six or seven days a week and relied on portable toilets outside, and that employees would show up in the morning and see Ted, wearing a robe or wrapped in a towel, wandering out of his office, where he slept on a Murphy bed, to retrieve coffee from the newsroom. Once, Steve Heyer remembers, he walked into Turner's office and the great man was sitting at his desk stark naked. \"Don't get up!\" someone exclaimed. Nick Charles recalls, \"He was much more than a cheerleader. He was the kind of guy you'd want to run through a wall for.\"\n\nAt first, many CNN employees were dubious. Daniel Schorr, a former CBS correspondent, who was hired early on, was worried every time he heard Turner extoll the importance of good news, as if what he wanted were more happy news. Worry spread when, in 1982, Turner, frustrated by Schonfeld's close-to-the-vest management style and ownerlike ego, abruptly fired him. Lou Dobbs, another CNN pioneer, who was a business-news anchor, remembered Turner as a drunken sailor and thought that he might not be \"the right fellow to lead the effort.\" Dobbs was afraid that Turner was more an \"eccentric\" than a \"visionary\"-until he got to know him. \"He is a natural-born leader,\" Dobbs says. \"I once asked him his definition of a leader. He said, 'A leader has the ability to create infectious enthusiasm.' \"\n\nClockwise from top left: Turner with Jane Fonda; at his ranch; and with Frédérique D'arragon.\n\nCNN started as an all-day, mostly live, and mostly domestic news service. But it strayed to cover Cuba's 1981 May Day parade and a speech by Fidel Castro, and that led to an invitation for Turner to visit the island. Turner, who had never been to a Communist country, and whose politics continued to soften, was curious about it, and the next year he accepted the invitation. For the better part of four days, the Cuban Communist and the Southern conservative hung out, smoking cigars, attending a baseball game, duck hunting, visiting schools, discussing politics, and night-clubbing. To an associate, Turner said, \"Fidel ain't a Communist. He's a dictator, just like me.\" He learned that Castro watched CNN's signal from southern Florida; ever the salesman, he persuaded Castro to tape a promotional spot. Castro, in turn, urged Turner to take his news service worldwide. \"Ted came back fired up,\" Eason Jordan remembers. International news quickly expanded-CNN sent its first signal to Asia in late 1982 and to Europe in 1985. Jordan was twenty-eight when he started running CNN's foreign-news coverage.\n\nIn the beginning, the broadcast networks refused to include CNN in their pooled coverage of White House events. Turner filed a federal lawsuit in Atlanta against the \"cartel\" and the Reagan Administration, claiming violations of the antitrust laws and of CNN's rights under the First Amendment. To build support for CNN in Congress, Turner spent thirteen thousand dollars to install a satellite dish for the House and cabled the office of each member of Congress. Because CNN had twenty-four hours of news to fill, a congressman had a much better chance of being seen there. Ted Turner would win the battle for public support; more important, in a landmark ruling in the spring of 1982, the Atlanta court declared in CNN's favor, and by the mid-eighties CNN's triumph was apparent.\n\nOne reason for Turner's success-with CNN, with the Superstation, with buying sports teams to supply cable programming-is identified by Bob Wright, the president and C.E.O. of NBC. \"He sees the obvious before most people do,\" Wright says. \"We all look at the same picture, but Ted sees what you don't see. And after he sees it, it becomes obvious to everyone.\" As the networks shrank their overseas bureaus, CNN expanded. It invested in \"flyaway\" portable satellite dishes, costing about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars each, that could be carried in a suitcase and used anywhere in the world to \"uplink\" to a satellite. Turner wanted to grow bigger still. Although Turner Broadcasting had a mere two hundred and eighty-two million dollars in revenue in 1984, and the New York banks spurned his request for credit, in 1985 Turner got junk-bond financing that enabled him to make a $5.4-billion offer for a broadcast network: CBS.\n\nKnowing that he was an underdog, Turner sought political support from Senator Jesse Helms, of North Carolina. Helms had mounted a campaign against CBS's \"liberal bias,\" and he encouraged Turner to meet with a group called Fairness in Media, which had sent letters to a million conservatives begging them to buy CBS stock and \"become Dan Rather's boss.\" Up North, many in the media expressed horror at the prospect of Turner, whom they regarded as an unsophisticated Southerner-a redneck-owning \"the Tiffany network.\" Thomas Wyman, who was the C.E.O. of CBS, questioned Turner's moral fitness to run a network and accused him of being in bed with ideological groups, although he didn't name any. Wyman and CBS, hoping to block Turner, welcomed the \"white knight\" financing of Laurence Tisch, of the Loews Corporation, and Tisch stealthily gained control of CBS.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, however, Turner was not the provincial portrayed by CBS. As he sought to build CNN overseas, he became much more of an internationalist; he was more concerned with saving the environment, eradicating poverty, and ending the Cold War. He met and became friends with Jacques Cousteau, the primatologist Jane Goodall, the civil-rights leader Andrew Young, and the environmentalist Russell Peterson. \"I was hanging around with people who cared about the future of the planet, both of the human race and of the environment,\" he says. \"And they had an impact on me.\" Although he had once been a smoker, he now refused to hire anyone who smoked. \"I figured any young person who's dumb enough to smoke is too dumb to work at CNN or TBS,\" he says. In 1985, he established the Better World Society, whose purpose was to subsidize documentaries on the dangers of environmental pollution, nuclear weapons, and the population explosion. He also began to proselytize for an end to the Cold War. After the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics, following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union withdrew from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, Turner financed and launched the Goodwill Games to foster athletic competition between the United States and the U.S.S.R. During this time, Turner even thought of running for President.\n\nBut to those who didn't know him-and even to some members of his board, who did-Turner was still often seen as Captain Outrageous. They were tired of hearing that he was going to own a network or a Hollywood studio, that he was going to make movies like \"Gone with the Wind.\" So when, in August of 1985, Turner, without fully consulting his board, bought, for a billion and a half dollars, the M-G-M film studio, its Culver City lot, and its library of more than thirty-five hundred motion pictures the consensus was that he had overpaid. The financing for his impulsive decision was arranged by Drexel Burnham's junk-bond king, Michael Milken, who was representing both Turner and the owner of M-G-M, Kirk Kerkorian. Milken reduced the amount of cash Turner needed by persuading Kerkorian to accept stock in Turner Broadcasting. The difficulty was that Turner found himself with two billion dollars' worth of debt; within three months, he was forced to sell the studio and other parts of M-G-M back to Kerkorian, for three hundred million dollars.\n\nHe kept the film library, however, and he brilliantly exploited this asset. The movies became a source of cheap television programming, and Turner created new cable networks-such as TNT (Turner Network Television), launched in 1988, and TCM (Turner Classic Movies), in 1994-to showcase them. Looking back, he is pleased with himself for having done this \"right under the networks' noses\" and for having managed to grow \"from one-thousandth the size of the networks to two and a half times bigger.\" He says, \"They laughed at me when I started with CBS. They laughed at me when I started CNN. They laughed at me when I bought the Braves. They laughed at me when I bought the Hawks. They laughed at me when I bought M-G-M. I spent a lot of time thinking, and I did not fear, because of my classical background. When Alexander the Great took control when his dad died, he was twenty years old. He took the Macedonian Army, which was the best army in the world at the time, and conquered Greece, got the Greeks to all join with him, and then marched across the Hellespont and invaded Asia. They didn't even know where the world ended at that time. And he was dead at thirty-three, thirteen years later. He kept marching. He hardly ever stopped. And he never lost a battle.\"\n\nTurner did lose battles, even if they were within the company. Kerkorian, it was revealed, had a stipulation that if Turner did not reduce his debt within six months he would have to pay Kerkorian in TBS stock, and Turner worried that Kerkorian could soon gain control of his company. On top of this, companies like Rupert Murdoch's were turning a raptor's eye on the debt-ridden Turner empire. To avoid losing everything, Turner, in 1987, looked to a consortium of thirty-one cable companies-in particular, T.C.I. and Time Inc.'s cable subsidiary-for a bailout. In return for more than five hundred million dollars in cash, Turner ceded more than one-third ownership to them; he also granted the cable executives seven of fifteen board seats and an effective veto over any expenditure exceeding two million dollars. \"In hindsight, you could say that Ted lost his company,\" Terry McGuirk says. \"But, at the time, it was in many ways Nirvana, because Ted partnered with his best customers.\" Turner, however, wanted to expand, and his new partners did not. They wanted to protect Turner's programming assets for the cable industry and keep them away from broadcast rivals. Or they wanted the assets for themselves.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner had watched as, in 1985 and 1986, Murdoch formed the Fox network, and CBS, NBC, and ABC got new owners. Increasingly frustrated, he began to spend even more time away from Atlanta. Whenever he wanted to do something bold-buy a studio or a network, for example-he confronted a veto from his board. Decisions about acquisitions were made by committee. One of the few acquisitions that the board approved, in 1991, and only after Turner wore board members down, was of Hanna-Barbera, whose animation library included more than a third of all the animated cartoons ever made in this country; with this library, Turner was able to create the now thriving Cartoon Network.\n\nWhen it came to programming decisions, Turner remained in charge. Brad Siegel, the president of Turner's Entertainment Networks, remembers that when, in 1993, he was hired to run TNT Turner involved himself in such questions as what programs provided the proper lead-ins for 8 P . M . adult dramas. \"One of the great things about Ted is that he watches everything,\" Siegel says. \"Everything we make on the entertainment side-the pilots, the movies, the specials-Ted watches everything on tape. You always got a call.\" And when the ratings were poor but the program was good-as when TNT aired a \"David Copperfield\" movie-Turner congratulated Siegel.\n\nTurner's most visible success came ten years after CNN went on the air-with its coverage of the Gulf War. Unlike the other networks, CNN made a financial commitment to cover any potential war from ground zero, Baghdad. Eason Jordan figured that the Iraqi communications system would be taken out in any allied air raid, so he recommended that CNN invest in a suitcase version of a satellite phone; this expenditure, of fifty-two thousand dollars, would be added to the extra millions that CNN was committed to spend to cover what might be the first live war. Tom Johnson, a former Los Angeles Times publisher, had taken over as president of CNN on August 1, 1990; the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait came on his second day at work. Johnson recalls going to Turner with various spending plans for war coverage. He asked Turner, \"What am I authorized to spend?\"\n\n\"You spend whatever you think it takes, pal,\" Turner said. Johnson was amazed, especially because, he recalls, \"I'm not even sure he remembered my name.\"\n\nJohnson posted people around the clock in Baghdad and Amman and Saudi Arabia and Israel and the White House and the Pentagon and the State Department. CNN, he says, spent twenty-two million dollars covering the war. CNN got permission from the Iraqi government to circumvent the Al Rashid Hotel switchboard and set up a four-wire telephone transmission from Baghdad to Amman, and then to Atlanta. When the United States destroyed the telephone system in Baghdad, only CNN had a telephone. When the Bush Administration urged the broadcast networks to pull their crews out of Iraq, they complied. Tom Johnson tells how he received calls from President Bush and other government officials, urging him to leave Baghdad, and how vexing this was. When he met with Turner and told him about these calls, and about two bureau chiefs who had been killed when he was at the Los Angeles Times , Turner was unmoved. He told Johnson, \"I will take on myself the responsibility for anybody who is killed. I'll take it off of you if it's on your conscience.\" Johnson adds, \"I, frankly, was about to order them back to Amman. I thought they'd all get killed.\"\n\nNo one got killed. And Turner was acclaimed as a different kind of businessman, one who thought about more than profit margins. When he commissioned a CNN documentary series, of more than twenty hours, on the Cold War, Rick Kaplan says, \"his attitude was, if we break even on 'The Cold War' it would still be an enormous success.\" Turner understood, in a way that many corporate leaders do not, that building a brand can be expensive.\n\nIn the late eighties, Turner's personal life became happier. Jimmy Carter remembers that he was hunting and fishing with Turner at Avalon, Turner's estate in Tallahassee, Florida, when Turner read that Jane Fonda was planning to divorce Tom Hayden, the sixties activist. Turner told Carter that he had always admired Fonda, as an actor and as an outspoken liberal. \"I think I'm going to ask her for a date,\" he said. When he called, Fonda put him off. She was not yet ready to date, she told Turner, although she was soon photographed at St. Bart's cavorting with an Italian soccer player.\n\nTurner's second marriage had ended in 1988, after twenty-four years, three children, and many dalliances. His dating patterns conformed to his travel schedule; he took up with, among others, a Playboy bunny and the female pilot of his private plane. Turner was persistent with Fonda, and finally, in late 1989, they had their first date. It was followed by many others, including an Academy Awards ceremony, a White House dinner, a Kremlin dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev. They went horseback riding at Turner's Montana ranches; later, Turner, with Fonda by his side, would point out a cabin to visitors and announce that this was where they first made love. Both were famous, opinionated, rich, and attractive. Both loved the outdoors. Both had endured difficult childhoods under severe fathers. Neither finished college. And both felt profound guilt after the suicide of a parent; Fonda's mother had slashed her own throat at the age of forty-two. \"She is fiercely focussed and full of idealism and, like all of us, full of insecurities, too. And so is he,\" the former Colorado senator Tim Wirth, who is a friend of both, says. \"She reinforced all the best qualities in him. And she said to me the sweetest thing. She said, 'You know, Ted is the only person who's apologized more than I have.' They are really good, vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe couple held hands on Larry King's CNN program. They kissed in public. Turner brought her to CNN executive meetings and they sent mash notes to each other. She got him to drink less and diet more, to spruce up his wardrobe and buy art for his houses. Turner's mood swings became less pronounced; he yelled less, and he stopped taking lithium, which he had been on for about three years because, he says, \"a quack\" psychiatrist misdiagnosed him as \"manic.\"\n\nTurner and Fonda married in December of 1991 at his Florida estate, where bride and groom wore white and were surrounded by their children; they dined on fresh quail that Fonda had shot herself, candied yams, collard greens, and corn bread. Turner hates being alone, so Fonda moved to Atlanta. For much of the next decade, she was at his side. In Montana, Turner announced that he was getting rid of his cattle and sheep and returning the land to bison, the animals that grazed there two centuries ago. Fonda became an enthusiastic hunter. Gerald Levin, who says that he is \"constitutionally opposed to killing animals,\" remembers how, on a visit to one of Turner's properties, he learned that Fonda had shot a deer and loaded it into a pickup truck. \"I was appalled,\" Levin says. \"It was Bambi in the back of the truck!\"\n\nIn Atlanta, Turner did not live in a grand style. He poked a hole in the roof of the CNN Center building and put in a spiral staircase to connect the office to what has been called a penthouse but is really a seven-hundred-square-foot efficiency apartment, with a cramped bedroom. (One wall of the bedroom is a two-hundred-gallon saltwater fish tank, on the other side of which is the living room.) The most striking features of the apartment are a terrace, largely unused, with sweeping views of downtown (for a long while, Turner says, he \"was the only downtown resident-except homeless people!\"), and a photograph-one of the few on display-of Ed Turner looking up adoringly at his son. Turner had slept in his old office for a decade; this apartment allowed him to walk to work and to order room service from the Omni Hotel. To accommodate Fonda, he converted the bedroom closet into a windowless office for her-\"a storage closet,\" Fonda called it.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I learned a lot from Jane,\" Turner says. Laura Seydel, his eldest daughter, explains that her father only reluctantly celebrated Christmas and, until he married Fonda, did not invest time in planning family gatherings. Soon Fonda and Turner and his five children and their families had reunions twice a year, and swapped Christmas presents, and attended church christenings. Laura and her husband, Rutherford Seydel II, live in Atlanta with three young children and are active in charitable activities; Seydel works as a lawyer for Turner. He and Laura think of Turner as a great man, but he was not always a great family man. After he married Fonda, however, Grandpa Turner was around more.\n\nTurner was surprised but not displeased that Fonda attracted more attention than he did when they travelled. Fonda says that Turner was never jealous of the notice she received. \"He doesn't have that kind of ego,\" she says. \"He put me on a pedestal. He loved my successes.\" Although he is not an introspective or patient man, Turner probably opened up more to Fonda than he ever had to anyone else, male or female. By most accounts, the marriage was a good one, and Turner's friends and family came to adore Fonda. Laura says, \"She's grandma to our kids. She filmed our firstborn.\" Embraced by senior female executives at Turner Broadcasting, she went on three-day all-\"girls\" trips. \"Her influence was profound,\" Jimmy Carter told me. Carter smiled as he talked about Turner. \"Ted has always been very hyper, in that he's constantly having visions of grandiose things. He was very restless . . . always dreaming. Ted told us he was taking sedation to calm himself. . . . When he and Jane got together, Ted became much more relaxed.\"\n\nIn the early nineties, Turner began worrying once more that his company was too small. The networks had persuaded the government to relax the rules that prohibited them from owning and syndicating TV programs, which is where television fortunes are made. Turner didn't own a studio, and he feared that the studios would reserve their best programs for their networks, starving Turner Broadcasting. Nor could he match the resources of NBC, now owned by G.E., in bidding for world rights to televise the Olympics, or ABC, owned by Disney, in bidding for Monday Night Football. Turner Broadcasting got smaller compared with its competitors. The usual edge of an entrepreneur like Turner-the rabbit's advantage-seemed less vital than size.\n\n\"You need to control everything,\" Turner said one day recently in his New York office, his foot up against an empty coffee table. \"You need to be like Rockefeller with Standard Oil. He had the oil fields, and he had the filling stations, and he had the pipelines and the trucks and everything to get the gas to the stations. And they broke him up as a monopoly. You want to control everything. You want to have a hospital and a funeral home, so when the people die in the hospital you move them right over to the funeral home next door. When they're born, you got 'em. When they're sick, you got 'em. When they die, you got 'em.\" He smiled and added, \"The game's over when they break you up. But in the meantime you play to win. And you know you've won when the government stops you.\"\n\nTurner set his sights once more on buying a studio or a TV network, or arranging a business partnership with one. With John Malone, he tried to buy Paramount. When Viacom won that competition, Turner and Malone explored purchasing ABC and then entered what Turner thought were serious negotiations to acquire NBC; again, some of the cable owners on his board opposed him. Turner says that Gerald Levin, of Time Warner (Time Inc. had merged with Warner Communications in 1990), which owned nineteen per cent of Turner's company, used that position to veto the five-billion-dollar purchase. Levin was straightforward; he said that the interests of separate companies often diverge. If Turner wanted a network, so did Levin, who was planning to launch his own network, WB.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to merge with Ted,\" Malone told me. \"No one wanted to turn control over to Ted.\" This was true of Rupert Murdoch, who had once gone skiing with Turner. \"He is one of the most charming people you'd ever meet,\" Turner says. \"He told me he loved CNN the way it was and if we merged with him he wouldn't change a thing.\" Turner, who detests Murdoch, says that he didn't believe him. (Murdoch declined to comment.) There was a brief courtship by Bill Gates, of Microsoft; Gates thought that the power of CNN's brand could be transformed into an instantly successful online-news site. Turner thought that Microsoft's deep pockets could be used to help finance a bid for CBS. But the talks went nowhere. (Not long after this, Microsoft became a partner in MSNBC.) Meanwhile, Time Warner was determined that, if anyone was going to take over CNN and Turner's assets, it was going to be Time Warner.\n\nWhen Turner is agitated, the people close to him try to prevent him from talking to reporters or giving a speech. Around this time, however, he was scheduled to speak at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington. Jane Fonda says that she was aware of the \"fragility\" of the relationship between Turner and Time Warner. \"One false move and it would fall apart. I didn't sleep that night. Ted slept like a baby.\" When Turner rose to speak, he startled the audience by mentioning a story on clitorectomies that CNN had aired. Suddenly, he started comparing the mutilation of women to what Gerald Levin was doing to him. He cried out, \"You talk about barbaric mutilation. Well, I'm in an angry mood. I'm angry at that, too. I'm being clitorized by Time Warner!\"\n\n\"I slid under my seat,\" Fonda says. Levin, more diplomatically, says, \"Ted is Ted. He not only says what he thinks; he gives the most amazing speeches. While I think his analogy is a little stretched, he was peeved at the time. He actually called me up, and we talked about it. It wasn't a problem.\"\n\nIt was a problem. Turner felt fenced in, as he does when he is handed a speech to read or when he's told that he can't do something. \"My inner dream is to go to the place,\" he starts to explain-and suddenly breaks into the old Roy Rogers theme song-\"where the West commences, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses. . . . Don't fence me in.\" Fences loom large in Turner's mind; he hates them, and that is one reason that his landholdings are so vast. \"I'm happiest when I'm on a horse on my ranch,\" he says. At the same time, he can't stand to be alone.\n\nThis much is clear: by 1995, after thirty-two years in business, Turner no longer felt like a nimble rabbit. In the spring and early summer of that year, Terry McGuirk, representing Turner, tried to extricate Turner Broadcasting from Time Warner. \"I spent about six months negotiating an exit from Time Warner and doing a deal with John Malone,\" McGuirk recalls. But, much as Turner admired Malone, he feared placing CNN in the hands of such a committed conservative. He was also concerned about Malone's business partnerships with Murdoch. Turner's own biases clearly infected CNN. It was an international network that slavishly covered the United Nations, from whose vocabulary, by Turner's dictate, the term \"foreign news\" was banished, that aired documentaries on subjects Turner cared about. People at CNN undoubtedly knew what the boss wanted. But CNN was not used to punishing Turner's foes, as Murdoch's newspapers sometimes did to Murdoch's foes. Turner \"never once had me pull a story,\" Tom Johnson says. Nor, says Gail Evans, the CNN executive vice-president in charge of booking guests, did he ever order executives to help a friend. \"In my twenty years here, Ted has never once asked me to book a guest,\" she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerald Levin had concluded that his company was not big enough; he saw CNN as \"the jewel\" that he could link with Time Warner's magazines. Levin also knew that he had to move fast, before Turner was bought by a competitor. After talking it over with only two members of his team-Richard Parsons, the president, and Richard Bressler, the chief financial officer-Levin phoned Turner and asked if he could fly to Montana to discuss an \"important\" matter.\n\nLink copied\n\nThis was in August of 1995, and by then, Turner says, \"I knew I was selling the company. And there was another reason I did it, too. I was a little bit tired.\" He was tired of his cable partners. Whatever differences he had with Levin, however, Turner knew that Levin cared deeply about journalism, for he was a proud defender of his magazines' independence. Turner also knew that a merger would connect Turner Broadcasting to a Hollywood studio, a giant music company, the country's largest magazine-publishing enterprise, and its foremost cable system.\n\nWhen Levin's plane landed that morning, Jane Fonda picked him up. Although Turner had weekend house guests-including his neighbors Meredith and Tom Brokaw-he and Levin went out on the porch alone and Levin consulted ten or so points he had jotted down on a piece of paper about why Turner and Time Warner were a perfect fit. Turner Broadcasting, he said, \"would be the pivot point in the center of the company,\" and Ted Turner would be a partner, not an employee. When he and Levin walked back into the house and Turner saw Brokaw, who had just arrived, he shouted, \"Hey, buddy. We just made a deal. We're going to merge.\" Brokaw remembers that Levin looked startled when Turner revealed their secret.\n\nTurner had traded a silent boss for a real one. But he still owned almost eleven per cent of the merged company, and he was not timid. He pressed Levin to sell off company airplanes and expensive American art and to curb costs at the Hollywood studio. He stepped in to stop a fifty-million-dollar sale of Warner Bros, movies to CBS, insisting that the Warner films should be offered first to its own cable networks. He won control of all new international channels, preventing Warner Bros. from spending millions to build a staff that would duplicate Turner Broadcasting's. He pushed for across-the-board budget reductions, and, as the Wall Street Journal reported, he even fired his own son, Robert E. (Teddy) Turner IV, who was a promotions manager for Turner Home Entertainment, bluntly warning him over a family dinner, \"You're toast.\"\n\nWhether by design or by accident, Levin began to use Turner for his own purposes. \"The edict from Gerry Levin was 'Let Ted be Ted,'\" a Levin confidant recalls. \"Time Warner was buttoned up and bureaucratic. Ted was a breath of fresh air, and Gerry used that to the advantage of the company.\" When they met with employees, he remembers, \"Ted would get up and say, 'I've got one suit. I don't spend my money on suits. I own ten per cent of the company and each dollar you waste, ten cents comes from me.'\" Levin remembers that he was \"very comfortable\" with Ted's saying whatever he wanted, and had no illusions that it could be any other way. Levin and many other Time Warner executives were pleasantly surprised that Turner was a team player. Within the Turner Broadcasting group, Gail Evans says, Turner didn't change the way he worked, except to occasionally say, \"I have to check with the boss.\"\n\nNo matter how many times Turner checked, however, he and Levin never grew close. They didn't communicate regularly. Turner was hurt that Levin, who is intensely private, never invited him to his home for dinner. They had business differences-Turner, for example, wanted Levin to fold the Warner Bros. television operations into Turner Broadcasting. He still resented Levin's veto of his potential purchase of NBC, believing that if he had succeeded he never would have sold his company and, he laments, \"I'd have bought Time Warner instead of going the other way.\" Levin, who then wore a thick mustache chopped at the ends, as if he'd got tired of shaving, was reclusive and weighed his words carefully; the six-foot-one Turner towered over him and was impulsive. Levin was a schemer; Turner could become so focussed on the moment that sometimes when he got off his horse he dropped the reins and the horse galloped away, leaving him stranded. \"There are probably not two more different individuals that I've ever worked with,\" Terry McGuirk says.\n\nInevitably, perhaps, after the Time Warner merger Turner and Murdoch declared war on each other. Turner said that Murdoch had to be stopped before he took over the media and used them as a weapon to advance his conservative agenda and his business interests. Turner asserts that men of good will can resolve differences between, say, Arabs and Israelis, yet he does not believe that it is possible to play Chamberlain to Murdoch's Hitler. \"How do you make peace with a mega-maniac?\" Turner said to me in a November, 1996, interview. \"Chamberlain tried to make peace. When you've got somebody like that, I don't think there's a spark of human decency in him-except he likes his family.\" Turner said that Murdoch's Fox News network would do in America what Murdoch had done in China, where he removed the BBC from his satellite system in order to gain favor with the government. Murdoch's New York Post taunted Turner, describing him as a doormat for foreign dictators, suggesting that he was wacky, and portraying Fonda as Hanoi Jane. The battle became so ferocious that executives in both camps grew concerned; after all, Fox wanted television shows from Warner Bros. and Warner Bros. needed Murdoch's satellites. Fox would need Time Warner cable systems to carry its new cable news service. In the end, business interests outweighed principles, a truce was arranged, and, though Turner has never altered his view of Murdoch, he began to focus on other things.\n\nWith McGuirk running Turner Broadcasting day to day, Turner had more time. And, with Time Warner's stock price soaring, he also had more money. In September of 1997, he was to be honored by the United Nations Association-USA, and he had the idea of giving a billion dollars-then a third of his wealth-to the United Nations. The Turners were flying to New York when Turner told his wife what he planned. \"I was extremely moved,\" Jane Fonda says, adding that she told her husband, \"Don't you think you should talk to your lawyers first?\" He did, and learned that he could not make the gift directly to the U.N.\n\nThe next day, as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalls, Turner walked into Annan's office and blurted, \"Hi, Kofi. I'm going to give you a billion dollars.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a joke,\" Annan says, shaking his head in wonderment.\n\nThat night, Turner announced that he would give a hundred million dollars a year for ten years to support such U.N. programs as the elimination of land mines, providing medicine for children, and easing the plight of refugees. He hired Tim Wirth, who eventually recruited a staff of thirty-two, to oversee the effort. Turner's only condition was that his money be used only minimally for administrative overhead. Annan remembers that Turner also said, \"All of you billionaires out there, watch out. I'm coming after you.\"\n\nTurner has written his own version of the Ten Commandments, which he keeps on typed cards in his wallet. Without prompting, he will read from a list that includes these vows: \"'I promise to care for planet earth and all living things thereon'; 'I promise to treat all persons everywhere with dignity, respect, and friendliness'; 'I promise to have no more than one or two children'; 'I reject the use of force'; 'I support the United Nations.'\" Along with his manifest generosity, Turner remains enough of a ham to seek a fitting reward: a Nobel Prize. \"I've thought about it a little bit,\" Turner said when I asked him. \"Of course I've thought of it.\"\n\nTurner is easily moved to tears. He sobbed openly when Princess Diana was killed. On a trip to China in October of 1999, with Fonda reading and CNN's Eason Jordan working, Turner put on his headphones and popped in the videotape of a popular Warner Bros. cartoon movie, \"The Iron Giant,\" the story of the friendship between a young boy and a metallic being from outer space who sacrifices himself for the sake of the planet. Jordan remembers looking over at his boss. \"Tears were streaming down his face,\" he says. \"I never saw anybody cry like that in my life.\" As the credits rolled, Turner called out, \"That's the saddest thing I've ever seen!\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAmerica and Russia still have some seven thousand nuclear weapons targeted at each other, and Turner is terrified that these-along with chemical and biological weapons-could fall into the wrong hands. He dismisses the Bush Administration's effort to build an anti-missile defense system as madness; the technology won't work, he says, and, in any case, it won't prevent weapons of mass destruction from being delivered by car, by ship, or in a suitcase. All these dangers are \"off the radar screen,\" he says. \"We have a huge job. Probably ninety-five per cent of the U.S. population doesn't know about it.\" Thus Turner's Nuclear Threat Initiative. To lead it, he has recruited former Senator Sam Nunn, who once chaired the Armed Services Committee, and who signed on only after Turner agreed to allow him a free hand. \"When he gets behind something, people know it's serious, and it's going to have the energy and resources,\" Nunn says. Most days, Turner is a fan of the cautious Nunn; some days, he worries that Nunn is fencing him in.\n\nTurner's miserable last year actually began a few years ago, when Fonda began spending more time in Atlanta and less time with him. She wanted to be with her daughter Vanessa Vadim, who had moved to Atlanta and was raising a child on her own. Fonda's daughter Lulu, whose father was a Black Panther, and whom Jane took in when she and Tom Hayden ran a California camp for troubled kids, had also moved to Atlanta. In addition, Fonda had started the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, and had taken up the cause of nurturing teen mothers. During this time (according to an E! biography of Fonda that aired last fall), Fonda started attending services at the Providence Missionary Baptist Church. Turner, who alternately describes himself as an atheist and an agnostic, told me his reaction: \"I had absolutely no warning about it. She didn't tell me she was thinking about doing it. She just came home and said, 'I've become a Christian.' Before that, she was not a religious person. That's a pretty big change for your wife of many years to tell you. That's a shock. I mean, normally that's the kind of thing your wife or husband would discuss with you before they did it or while they were thinking about it. . . . Obviously, we weren't communicating very well at that time.\"\n\n\"My becoming a Christian upset him very much-for good reason,\" Fonda says. \"He's my husband and I chose not to discuss it with him-because he would have talked me out of it. He's a debating champion. He saw it as writing on the wall. And it was about other things. He knew my daughter was having a baby and it would take me away from him. He needs someone to be there one hundred per cent of the time. He thinks that's love. It is not love. It's babysitting. I didn't want to tell you this. We went in different directions. I grew up.\" Turner's daughter Laura doesn't think religion per se was the real basis of their disagreement. She says, \"It was another male\"-Jesus. \"It took time away from him.\"\n\nThere were other differences, friends of both say, including Turner's libido and his insecurities. \"My problem is I love every woman I meet,\" Turner has said. He and Fonda visited marriage counsellors and psychiatrists, to no avail. On January 4,2000, they announced an official separation; before the announcement, Frédérique D'arragon, who is fifty-one, and has been in and out of Turner's life for more than thirty years, came back into it. She is almost a foot shorter than Turner, and prefers jeans to designer dresses. Fonda and D'arragon had lunch recently in Atlanta, and Fonda makes it clear that D'arragon will be available for Ted in ways she no longer can be: \"He needs to be taken care of. She has no children. And she's loved him a long time.\" But travelling with Ted has taken its toll on D'arragon, just as it did on Fonda. Turner admits that the persistent travel is \"driving her nuts.\"\n\nA close friend says that Turner is burdened by three things: an insecurity that can be traced back to his abusive father; a manic, restless nature; and lust. \"Each one of these is a great huge bear,\" the friend says. \"Turner must wrestle with three bears, and they sometimes overwhelm him.\" Fonda puts it another way: \"Why this guy didn't go under psychologically at age five, I don't know. It scarred him for life. It colors everything-his relationships, his anxieties . . .\"\n\nFonda and Turner insist that they still love each other; in fact, the best I have ever seen Turner look-his white hair washed and carefully combed, his thin white mustache trimmed, a chocolate-brown sports jacket nicely contrasting with pressed gray slacks, a burgundy tie, and brown Gucci loafers-was a December day in Atlanta when he and Fonda had a lunch date. Both friends and family are distressed by their split. But Fonda, despite her own notoriety as an actor and as a political activist, had lived in the shadow of three dominant husbands. By leaving Turner, she also announced her own liberation.\n\nTurner was despondent, and his sense of abandonment was heightened by the announcement, around the same time, that Time Warner was merging with AOL-more accurately, AOL was acquiring Time Warner. The price, based on the stock values of the companies on the day of the announcement, was pegged at a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars, the largest corporate marriage ever. Although Turner had been alerted to the merger discussions, he had not been invited by Gerald Levin to participate. \"Ted was not a strategic partner,\" a senior executive at Time Warner who is close to Turner told me. \"Gerry is a sole practitioner. He keeps things to himself. Ted was not in the loop. Yet Ted did not hesitate to endorse the deal.\" It was, after all, a growth strategy. Nor, according to an AOL strategist who was a party to the negotiations, was Turner's future role even a minor part of these discussions. What was talked about much more, he continued, was what a great fit CNN and AOL would be. \"You can AOL-ize CNN and do cross-promotions,\" the executives said enthusiastically. CNN, in fact, was desperately in need of promotion, for its ratings had plunged and its promotion budget had been cut.\n\nTurner would own four per cent (now just over three and a half per cent) of the new company and remain on the board, and he had won a vice-chairman title. But, while executives at the two companies respected Turner's many successes and his \"vision,\" they also found him unfathomable. One senior AOL executive who was working with Turner for the first time says, \"In meetings I've been in with him, he just sits there and in a piercing voice-louder than you would expect someone to talk-he interrupts or conveys a sense of 'Hurry up! Why am I here?' He gives off a feeling that he's in a rush, even if he's not doing anything.\"\n\nOver the next several months, as the two companies tried to get their executives working together and achieve the synergies they had touted, Turner was in Atlanta or New York no more than four or five days a month. He was not involved in budget details, as Terry McGuirk was, and soon McGuirk, an original Turner loyalist, signalled that he \"wanted out from under Ted,\" a senior member of the AOL Time Warner team explains. McGuirk admired Turner, but, if he was to be held responsible, then he wanted the authority, too.\n\nThere was one other difficulty. In the reorganized company, Steve Case was going to be the chairman and Levin the C.E.O., and the idea was to divide the company into separate spheres, each reporting to one of two presidents. Time Warner's Richard Parsons would oversee movies, music, publishing, legal affairs, and human resources. AOL's Robert Pittman would oversee AOL, cable, the magazines, television (including HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and the WB television network), and business development. \"By a process of elimination, it made sense for Terry McGuirk to report to Bob and for Ted to take a strategic role,\" a senior AOL Time Warner strategist says.\n\nSometimes Turner made light of his diminished role. Lou Dobbs remembers being invited to Turner's Montana ranch for a weekend. While they were fishing, Dobbs, who left CNN in 1999 to start an Internet venture, Space.com-and who returned last week to, among other things, anchor \"Moneyline News Hour\"-said, \"Ted, I outrank you. I'm C.E.O. and chairman.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting,\" Turner said. \"I'm also chairman of the Turner Foundation.\"\n\n\"Ted, that's nonprofit!\"\n\n\"What do you think Space.com is?\" Turner retorted, laughing.\n\nLink copied\n\nDobbs laughs, too, when telling this story, but, like many of Turner's friends, he is angry. \"He has not been treated with the respect due him,\" Dobbs says. Jane Fonda agrees. \"The way it was handled was really shocking,\" she says. \"It makes me mad. How dare they give him a phone call!\" Surely Turner did not feel that he was treated properly when CNN cancelled a pet project of his-a multipart documentary exploring the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He recruited a producer, George Crile, but, soon after Crile started work, Turner told him that he was encountering budget opposition at CNN. They would have to scale the project back to three hours. By October, 2000, it was down to a single hour. \"There's a lot of pressure to make the budgets,\" Turner explained, disappointed. In fact, he is so agitated by the budgeting strictures at CNN that, in December, he told me, \"I am going to produce, myself, ten hours on nuclear proliferation and chemical and biological warfare. I'll give first crack to CNN, and if they don't want it I'll give it to PBS.\" (By March, CNN's founder had given up on CNN documentaries. Together with former associates like Pat Mitchell, who is the president of PBS, and Robert Wussler, who had been a top Turner Broadcasting executive, he plans to team up with Bill Moyers for a series of PBS documentaries on world issues; the Turner Foundation will provide half the financing. \"Over the next few years I would hope we would do one hundred hours,\" Wussler says.)\n\nWhen he cut the Crile project from three hours to one, Tom Johnson says, \"Ted wasn't happy. I don't think he's happy with me. Ted knows I'm in a new world today.\" Turner was reminded of this \"new world\" when he invited me to sit in on a CNN executive-committee meeting on December 19th, and the invitation was rescinded. \"He invited you to a meeting that is not his meeting,\" an AOL Time Warner executive explained.\n\nThen, this past January, although Turner calls CNN \"the most profitable news operation in the world\"-it earned three hundred million dollars the previous year-its staff, of more than four thousand, was reduced by nearly ten per cent. Those who are gone include such Turner stalwarts as Elsa Klensch, Barbara Pyle, Nick Charles, Larry Woods, Gene Randall, and the Atlanta-based Turner Environment Division, with its show \"People Count,\" which Fonda sometimes hosted. On CNN evening programs, talk replaced news reports-often the shouting-head format that CNN inaugurated with \"Crossfire\" and which Fox News and MSNBC had copied and extended. \"Basically, the Fox prime-time schedule is just talk radio,\" Rick Kaplan, the former CNN/U.S. president, says.\n\nTom Johnson, who is worried about the future of CNN, says that Bob Pittman assured him that he and his colleagues in New York believed in CNN's mission. But Pittman's definition of CNN's mission may not match Johnson's or Turner's. Daily journalism is an inherently wasteful process: it involves waiting for calls to be returned, for airlines to fly, keeping forty-two bureaus functioning, chasing stories that don't pan out, and sometimes working for days on a single story. Will stockholders think this productive? As late as December, a longtime Turner executive predicted, \"Ted will protect us.\"\n\nLess than three months later, Turner was unable to protect two longtime lieutenants-Terry McGuirk and Steve Heyer. Turner says McGuirk and Heyer chafed at AOL Time Warner's demand that Turner Broadcasting's \"operating profits\" (EBITDA, which are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) grow by thirty-nine per cent in 2001-which Turner says is nearly double the actual profit-growth average of the company over the past five years. \"They were unhappy mainly that the financial goals they were given were unachievable without really hurting the company,\" Turner says.\n\nAOL Time Warner executives insist that the true profit-growth target for the Turner Broadcasting division is half that, and that Turner's percentage does not reflect significant accounting changes. (Nonsense, senior executives at Turner Broadcasting say, claiming that their operating profits in 2000 were just under a billion dollars and that their company-imposed goal for 2001 is nearly $1.4 billion; the growth target that AOL Time Warner presented to Wall Street for the entire company in 2001 is thirty-one per cent.) Associates say Pittman is disturbed that CNN has lost market share to Fox News and MSNBC; CNN's prime-time ratings for the first quarter of 2001 were down five per cent from last year, while Fox News's climbed by a hundred and twenty-six per cent and MSNBC's by seventeen per cent. Turner is particularly worried about Fox News, which is in fewer homes but has talk-show hosts like the conservative Bill O'Reilly, who is now reaching a larger audience than Larry King, CNN's ratings champion.\n\nTurner says that he is uncomfortable with what he believes are arbitrary budget goals-what he called the company's new preoccupation with \"short-term fluctuations\" in its stock price-saying, \"I never ran the company by the numbers.\" Pittman denies that the company is being run strictly by the numbers. \"I think CNN is one of the great assets in the world,\" he says. \"But it takes a long time to build a franchise based on reliability and trust. They got it. That's something you can't replace overnight. That's the core, the value.\" And, Pittman adds, \"everyone agreed on\" a growth-target number, including, he implies, McGuirk. McGuirk, asked about the growth target, refuses to comment. He does say, \"The numbers are given to us, not negotiated.\"\n\nTed Turner today gets more notice outside his company than in it. When Fidel Castro came to New York last year for a three-day summit meeting at the U.N., he wanted to spend one night having dinner with Turner, who flew in from Montana for the occasion. The dinner stretched past midnight, and Castro was in the middle of a long-winded story when Turner raised his hand and exclaimed, \"Fidel, this story is never going to end, is it? I got to go!\" Castro laughed as Turner exited. Turner was the first Western businessman to have a private audience with Russia's new President, Vladimir Putin, who, Turner remembers, used to drive him when Turner visited St. Petersburg and Putin was a deputy to the city's mayor. \"I learned the value of being nice to everyone,\" Turner says, jokingly. In a trip arranged by George Crile, last May, Turner was also among the few private citizens to visit a nuclear command center outside Moscow. General Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces, cautioned, \"Don't touch any buttons!\" There was a PowerPoint presentation, in English, delineating Russia's various nuclear forces. Turner learned that each of seven thousand warheads could obliterate everything within a one-to-two-mile radius before the radiation and the fires spread. Turner sat mute, Eason Jordan recalls, for an hour and a half, transfixed by what he heard and saw. \"It was the only time I ever saw him speechless,\" Jordan says.\n\nYakovlev and Putin, like Castro, watch CNN. \"The Carter Center has programs in sixty-five different nations,\" Jimmy Carter says. \"We deal with leaders of nations who have a human-rights problem or conflict. . . . We go to those countries, and they quite often do not have a U.S. embassy in them. Invariably, in the offices there will be a TV station tuned to CNN.\" They know about Turner, and they know, Carter adds, that Turner is a true citizen of the world, a man who speaks up for what he believes even when it offends his government. Carter describes Turner as a personal \"hero.\" Kofi Annan sees this in Turner's appeal. \"He and Castro have a similar quality,\" Annan says. \"They are folk heroes of a sort. You can have one hundred heads of state here, and most people will gravitate toward Castro. You can have one hundred media heads here, and people will gravitate toward Ted.\"\n\nIn mid-March, Turner made a two-day visit to Harvard. An evening appearance at the Kennedy School of Government drew a large audience, and he was introduced by Alex S. Jones, the director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, who said, \"Ted Turner changed America.\" Turner jumped up on the low platform, pumped Jones's hand, and started talking, with Jones still at his side. Turner used no notes. He wore a blue corduroy jacket and gray slacks. Perhaps it was the way he jumped up and, in his joltingly loud voice, started talking quickly, or the way he suddenly paused and drawled, \"Ahhhhhhhhhh\"; or perhaps it was the way he seemed to lapse into self-pity when he said, \"I'm just trying to do the best I can,\" or the way he raced from subject to subject, sometimes letting thoughts collide-how he was rejected by Harvard when he applied, and how he'd given Jane Fonda a hundred million dollars, and how, just recently, she bestowed more than twelve million of that sum on Harvard's School of Education for the study of gender and education, and how he wasn't a journalist but had related to the species since he sold newspapers as a boy-perhaps it was these quirks that caused the audience, as often happens when Turner speaks, to giggle. Michael Baumgartner, a first-year graduate student, initially thought Turner sounded drunk. Watching Turner speak is like watching live TV, with the audience wondering what will happen next.\n\nLink copied\n\nBut although at first people seemed to be laughing at Turner, the feeling in the room soon changed. On being told that President Bush earlier that day had abandoned a campaign pledge to establish \"mandatory reduction targets\" for carbon-dioxide emissions by power plants, Turner was momentarily silenced. \"That's heartbreaking news,\" he said finally. \"I mean, I can't take any more bad news. I've lost my job and my wife this year!\" Turner went on to talk about the environment, and about curbing nuclear weapons, and about his commitment to news. When he finished, students clamored to shake his hand.\n\nThat night, Turner was discreet about CNN. Asked about its future, he said, \"Well, I hope it's a bright one.\" But, while Turner thinks CNN has programmed \"too much\" talk, he has no idea how to cure its ratings woes: \"Quite frankly, I'm not sure I have the answers.\" Privately, he is concerned about a general dumbing down that is taking place in the media, putting \"DiSiprio\"-he means Leonardo DiCaprio-\"on the cover of Time . Obviously, it should be on the cover of People or Entertainment Weekly! \"\n\nBy the next morning, the man who confesses to a congenital inability to police a secret was no longer restrained. Turner did not criticize the recent round of cutbacks at CNN, but he did criticize the parent company's growth target. This was impossible to achieve, Turner said, without doing harm to CNN's journalism. \"I always wanted CNN to be the New York Times of the television business,\" he said, a little sadly.\n\nAlthough the AOL Time Warner merger took effect only in January, there have already been some successes. As the largest individual shareholder in the conglomerate, Turner is enthusiastic about a new emphasis on coördination and synergy. Of Gerald Levin's management over the past five years, Turner bluntly says, \"The Time Warner divisions did not coöperate the way they should have. . . . I think he did a pretty marginal job of running the company.\" Now, with roughly forty per cent of Americans using AOL to reach the Internet, AOL is vital in promoting each division of the company. In the eight months ending January 31st, for example, Pittman told Wall Street analysts, AOL had sold eight hundred thousand new subscriptions to Time Inc.'s different magazines. The company is in various businesses, Levin said at a conference earlier this month, but one word united them: \"subscriptions\"-a total of a hundred and thirty million subscribers.\n\nTurner, however, is afraid that when journalistic divisions like CNN shrink corporate executives may try to \"avoid doing stories that are critical of the big companies, like the oil companies and the automobile companies. It's not easy to do stories that are critical of G.E.-you know, nuclear-power-plant stories. When was the last time you saw stories on TV critical of G.E. or DuPont? Better to stay away from the corporations-they're the sponsors. That's the danger.\" Turner, to be sure, does not talk about the embarrassments of his own tenure, including CNN's unceasing coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder case and trial.\n\nAt another of his Harvard appearances-a session in which he was questioned by Jones and several others for an hour and then stayed for an hour more as the six finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting discussed their stories-Turner said, \"I've already been fired, and I probably will be again shortly.\" One of the Shorenstein Fellows rose and condescendingly suggested that Turner might follow the example of Henry Ford, who also left his job but who set up the Ford Foundation, which is \"one of the most influential forces for the framing of issues in the country. You have a life and a future and can use your contacts-\"\n\n\"I am,\" Turner interrupted, and he mentioned his gift to the U.N. Foundation. \"No other individual in the world is giving as much to the poor world as I am. I'm spending fifty million dollars in the United States, mostly on environmental and family-planning causes. Ahhhhhhhh . . . I mean, family planning is under attack. You know, pro-lifers have got control of the White House. Roe v. Wade is hanging on by a thread. A woman's right to choose? They want to take that away. We're fighting global warming.\" He mentioned the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the dues payment to the U.N. \"And let me tell you what else I'm doing. I'm very close to making an announcement of a personal partnership through our foundation with public broadcasting to fund important documentaries that Turner Broadcasting has dropped. . . . And I've been trying desperately to get my network. It won't be NBC, but it will start with an N-NTV. The good news? I'm gonna get my network. The bad news? It's in Russia! I'm gonna try and help freedom of the press. I mean, I am doing plenty, Bubba!\"\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether Turner will own a network in Russia. In early April, he announced a plan to purchase part of the network founded by the Russian press baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky. This pleased independent Russian journalists like Masha Lipman, the deputy editor of the magazine Itogi , who says, \"It will be much more difficult for the Russian authorities to play dirty jokes\" on Turner. But the hard questions, she says, are two: Who will control the journalistic enterprise-Turner or the Russian authorities? And will Turner receive real guarantees of editorial freedom? Turner's longtime colleague Bob Wussler says that Gazprom, the state-dominated monopoly that has asserted control over the TV network, told him and Turner, \"You go do a deal with Gusinsky and come back and we'll do a deal with you.\" And even though President Putin stopped short of offering what Wussler calls \"a ringing endorsement\" of press freedom when Turner asked for it, Wussler feels that \"Putin is a politician and can say just so much. We took it as a good sign.\" Last week, however, Turner was struggling to invent a formula to satisfy Gusinsky, Gazprom, and the journalists themselves. On the surface, the deal is consistent with Turner's world-diplomacy principle-\"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\" But it may also suggest a certain naïveté.\n\nTurner's ability to give his money away has diminished as his principal stock holding-AOL Time Warner-has declined by more than thirty per cent since the merger announcement, reducing his net worth by about two billion dollars. It is possible, he tells me, that he will end his association with the company entirely. He hasn't quite accepted the idea that his business career is largely over, but he believes that his primary mission now is to help save the world, and perhaps himself.\n\n\"For some reason, he has a guilty conscience,\" Jane Fonda told me. \"He went much further than his father thought he would. So what's left? To be a good guy. He knows he will go down in history. He won't go down as a greedy corporate mogul. Although he claims to be an atheist, at the end of every speech he says, 'God bless you.' He wants to get into Heaven.\" Fonda told me of a family outing in 1992 on the occasion of the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. They went to a matinée of a film about Columbus and in the darkened theatre someone screamed out a litany of Columbus's supposed sins. There was a silence, until Turner blurted, \"I never did that!\" Fonda reached over and soothed her husband by patting his knee and said, \"It's O.K., honey. I know you didn't.\" She now says, \"I did that a lot.\" Turner concedes, \"I wish I didn't apologize as much as I do.\"\n\nOver breakfast at the Charles Hotel, in Cambridge, I asked Turner why he felt so burdened. \"It's the position you're in,\" he said. \"Because I was at CNN, because I had commitments, because I did the Goodwill Games, because I was concerned, because I did all those documentaries, I developed a self-imposed sense of responsibility. If Gandhi and Martin Luther King could make the kind of sacrifices with their lives that they did, and that our parents did fighting in World War I and World War II, why couldn't I make sacrifices, too?\" At that, Turner looked up from his hearty chipped-beef-and-biscuit breakfast, in the middle of the hotel dining room, and, as people at nearby tables leaned forward to listen, he performed from memory parts of Thomas Macaulay's \"Horatius\":\n\nLink copied\n\nAnd how can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods. . . .\n\nHaul down the bridge, Sir Consul With all the speed ye may; I, with two more to help me, Will hold the foe in play. In yon straight path a thousand May well be stopped by three. Now who will stand on either hand, And keep the bridge with me?\n\n\"Pretty cool, huh,\" Turner said, grinning; he had, in the longer version that he recited, got almost every word right. \"If Horatius could do it, I can do it. He saved Rome. . . . He stopped the Etruscans.\" His smile widened, and he couldn't resist a final bow, with a loud \"heh-heh-heh.\" Then he leaned over and whispered, as if to a co-conspirator, \"I know a lot . My knowledge is my burden. If I didn't know so much, I could just go through life as a dilettante.\" He stood up and, watched by everyone in the room, walked briskly to the door.♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Lost Tycoon\n\nEarly last year, Ted Turner seemed invincible. He was the largest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, owning around four per cent of the soon-to-be-merged companies; his celebrated name was on the door of a major division, Turner Broadcasting System; and his dimpled chin, gap-toothed smile, and pencil-thin Gable-esque mustache were recognizable everywhere. His life is documented by the framed magazine covers that crowd the walls of his Atlanta office: Turner in 1976, launching the first \"Superstation,\" by transforming a weak local television signal into a robust cable network; Turner in 1977, skippering his boat, Courageous, to victory in the America's Cup; Turner pioneering the purchase of professional sports teams as cheap and reliable programming; Turner inventing the twenty-four-hour Cable News Network; Turner buying Hollywood film libraries to create new cable-television networks; Turner as Time's Man of the Year.\n\nTed Turner's business successes didn't end when, in 1996, Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner. His influence at the world's largest media company was pervasive; he played the role of crazy-uncle-in-the-basement whose large appetite for cost-cutting has to be appeased, and in the process he helped revive the company's stock. But when, in January of 2000, Time Warner and Turner agreed to join with the Internet company America Online, Turner was not invited to participate in the talks about how the merged company would function.\n\nLess than four months later, Ted Turner was fired. The news, Turner says, was delivered during a telephone call from Gerald Levin, the C.E.O. of Time Warner, who told Turner what Turner had often told others: the company was going to reorganize. Turner Broadcasting would no longer report to Turner but, rather, to Robert Pittman, the chief operating officer of AOL. \"You can't report to Pittman, so you have to have a more senior role,\" Levin remembers telling Turner. As Turner recalls, Levin went on to say, \"Sorry, Ted, but you lose your vice-chairman title as well.\" According to Levin, Turner offered to give up his vice-chairmanship in order to keep running the Turner Broadcasting division, which included CNN, TNT, Turner Classic Movies, the TBS Superstation, the Cartoon Network, the New Line Cinema studio, the Atlanta Braves baseball team, the Atlanta Hawks basketball team, the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team, and Time Warner's HBO. \"I didn't fire Ted,\" Levin insists today. \"I said, 'This is the way we need to run the company.'\"\n\nTurner protested, in a series of calls first to Levin, then to Steve Case, the C.E.O. of AOL, who was to be the chairman of the new company, demanding that he not be deprived of supervision of CNN and the other cable networks that he had started. He thought that he would prevail, and in early May-perhaps because he, like Levin, hates confrontation, or perhaps because making speeches has become his accustomed mode of communication and he had now spoken-Turner got on his plane and headed for New Mexico, where he owns a five-hundred-and-eighty-thousand-acre ranch, and where he had invited some friends to join him. Turner is America's largest individual landowner, with nearly two million acres, or the rough equivalent of the land area of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. He owns twenty-two properties, in nine states and Argentina, and he spends about half his time at one or another of them.\n\nTurner didn't see that his travels often slowed decision-making at Turner Broadcasting. Although he entrusted most matters to a deputy, Terence F. McGuirk, he expected to approve major projects himself. AOL and Time Warner executives, however, were impatient with the peripatetic Turner. He is sixty-two, and even his friends wanted him to slow down. Jane Fonda, his former wife, thinks that she knows why he is so restless: \"I say this with all the love in the world. . . . He has been severely, hauntingly traumatized. He always thinks something is about to be pulled out from him. He has no belief in permanency and stability. It's one reason why I'm not with him. Older age is about slowing down and growing vertically, not horizontally. That's not Ted.\"\n\nSomething was \"pulled out\" from Turner while he was in New Mexico, as he learned from a five-page fax that he received there. The fax, a press release issued by AOL Time Warner, announced a new management team for the company, awarding Turner one of two vice-chairmanships and \"the additional title of Senior Advisor.\" The fax did not say that he had lost much of his authority, or that his five-year contract to manage Turner Broadcasting had been abrogated a year early. John Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media and an old friend of Turner's, who was a guest at the ranch, recalls that when the fax arrived \"Ted went white. He was very upset. He thought it was extremely bad behavior for them to do it that way.\" Malone told Turner, \"You can sue, but you won't get your job back. You'll just get money.\"\n\nTurner's bosses tried to defuse the publicity with praise. At a press luncheon for CNN's twentieth anniversary, four weeks after the announcement, Case told reporters, \"Ted Turner has been a hero of mine for twenty-five years, and he and I are basically going to be joined at the hip.\" Turner can be seduced with kind words, with pleas to work for the good of the team, but he wasn't this time. \"'Vice-chairman' is usually a title you give to somebody you can't figure out what else to do with,\" he says. He likened himself to a monarch.\n\nTurner says that last year was one of the most miserable of his life. His marriage to Fonda ended, after eight years, and this, too, was announced in January. In addition, he smashed his foot in a skiing accident; his beloved black Labrador, Chief, contracted coonhound disease and was temporarily paralyzed; his back hurt and he thought that he needed surgery; and two of his grandchildren were diagnosed with Hurler's syndrome, a rare and sometimes lethal enzyme deficiency. Most adults have the support of a spouse and family, friends, and a job; Turner didn't have a spouse, had never had intimate friends, and no longer ran his own company. \"I felt like Job,\" Turner told me, adding, not for the first time, that he had felt \"suicidal.\"\n\nYet Turner has, in the past several years, been commanding more attention outside his company, making a new identity for himself as a philanthropist-\"I want to be Jiminy Cricket for America,\" he has said. In 1997, before it was fashionable for billionaires to make such gifts, he pledged a billion dollars to the United Nations. The Turner Foundation, which he controls, awarded fifty million dollars last year to environmental causes. (Turner is a devoted environmentalist-he can name every species of bird and animal on his ranches-and during the oil embargo of 1973 he sold his Cadillac and switched to more fuel-efficient cars; recently, he exchanged his Ford Taurus for a hybrid electric-and-gas Toyota Prius, which averages about fifty miles a gallon.) Last year, Turner started a foundation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, whose goal is to curb the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and he has pledged two hundred and fifty million dollars over the next five years. In December, to solve a long-running dispute between what the United States owed the United Nations and what Congress was willing to pay, Turner joined Richard C. Holbrooke, then the Ambassador to the U.N., to shape an extraordinary compromise: Turner would contribute the thirty-four-million-dollar difference, and the U.N. would adjust its future dues formula.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner calls himself \"a do-gooder.\" He says so in a loud voice, and it gets louder as he gets excited. Turner is uninhibited, and is usually blissfully unaware of others; for one thing, he is hard of hearing and is too vain to use a hearing aid. \"Half the people alive today are already living in what we would consider intolerable conditions,\" he declares. \"One-sixth don't have access to clean drinking water; one-fifth live on less than a dollar a day; half the women in the world don't have equal rights with men; the forests are shrinking; the temperature's rising, and the oceans are rising, because of the melting of the ice cap.\" He sounds like a billionaire Jeremiah. In a hundred years, he believes, New York will be under water and it will be \"so hot the trees are going to die.\" He continues, \"It will be the biggest catastrophe the world has ever seen-unless we have nuclear war.\" He is outraged that the United States and others don't do more to alleviate these horrors and to combat the defense and foreign policies of George W. Bush. \"The new Administration attempts to make enemies out of the Russians, the North Koreans, and the Chinese to justify the gigantic military buildup it wants to make in peacetime,\" he says. \"The economy of North Korea is smaller than the economy of Detroit!\" And he is disturbed by the world's exploding population; although he has five children, he once declared, \"If I was doing it over again, I wouldn't have had that many, but I can't shoot them now that they're here.\"\n\nTurner's contradictions are as clear as his views. He successfully opposed unionization at his company, yet he rails against élites. He has called himself \"a socialist at heart\" and a fiscal \"conservative.\" Turner speaks out on behalf of the rights of women but refuses to denounce Islamic states that suppress women's rights. He has compared Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Fox network, to Hitler, yet when he is asked if he thinks Saddam Hussein is evil he says, \"I'm not sure that I know enough to be able to answer that question.\" And though he preaches tolerance, he has uttered some intolerant words; for example, on Ash Wednesday, seeing the black smudge on the foreheads of some CNN staff members, he asked them whether they were \"Jesus freaks.\" As he frequently does when he says something unwise, Turner apologized, blithely assuming that the furor would pass. It did. A week later, Turner told me, \"That's the downside of speaking spontaneously.\"\n\nTurner has two offices, in New York and Atlanta, and they seem to capture the odd mixture of his views: in his New York office, which is nearly bare, a bust of Alexander the Great peers from a shelf, while the Atlanta office, which is vast and crammed with trophies and artifacts, features busts of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Gandhi. \"I've gone from a man of war to a man of peace,\" Turner explains. He offers the Turner principle of world diplomacy: \"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\"\n\nDespite Turner's success, people who meet him often think that he is peculiar. They hear his piercing laugh and the long \"Ahhhhhhhhh\"s he utters as he pauses between words or thoughts, which veer off in surprising directions, and they have no other explanation. A former director of Turner Broadcasting's board who counts himself a friend and a fan describes Turner as a fascinating amalgam of opposites: \"He's a mixture of a genius and a jackass. I think Ted could have run for President of the United States-if there were not the jackass side.\"\n\nThe \"jackass side\" of Turner appears because, he himself says, \"I don't have any idea what I'm going to say. I say what comes to my mind.\" Gerald Levin puts this in the best light: \"Ted is by far the most interesting person I've ever met-how he reacts to things. It's as if a child were speaking, without any social inhibitions. You don't say in business, 'I got fired.' He'll just speak out loud what may be going through someone's mind, and he'll say it to everybody. I think that's a beautiful characteristic. He's angelic. The whole world is socially constrained. I love and respect this about Ted, but for other people it may be very difficult.\"\n\nIn November of 1996, for instance, the Friars Foundation honored Turner at a lifetime-achievement black-tie dinner. After he received his award and made a short speech, the lights dimmed, and then, as various entertainers, including the comedian Alan King, prepared to roast him, Turner, who insists on getting to bed early, grabbed Fonda's arm and departed, leaving the crowd gasping and King bellowing, \"Rupert Murdoch was right-you are nuts.\"\n\nOn other occasions, humor redeems the situation. In January of 1999, Turner was invited to address the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin. Eason Jordan, who oversaw international coverage for CNN, had briefed Turner on what he shouldn't say to his audience, made up largely of Germans. Nevertheless, Jordan recalls, the CNN staff was nervous, because Turner had said, \"I'll wing it.\" And he did.\n\n\"You know, you Germans had a bad century,\" Turner declared. \"You were on the wrong side of two wars. You were the losers.\" He continued, \"I know what that's like. When I bought the Atlanta Braves, we couldn't win, either. You guys can turn it around. You can start making the right choices. If the Atlanta Braves could do it, then Germany can do it.\" The audience laughed with Turner, not at him. He left the podium to a standing ovation.\n\nTurner likens himself to Zorba the Greek: \"I lose my self-restraint and . . . just get up and dance sometimes.\" Gail Evans, a senior executive at Turner Broadcasting, says that Turner is always \"winking,\" and she recalls the time he asked her to take the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau to lunch: \"Go buy Mr. Cousteau a tuna-fish sandwich!\" Today, associates are not laughing; they speak of Turner in the past tense, offering epitaphs. \"He's the last of the revolutionary and creative minds in our business,\" CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, who joined the company in 1983, says. \"The idea of twenty-four-hour news and global news is his creation. That's changed the world. It's changed people's relations with their governments. It's meant that governments can no longer crack down with impunity on protests. And Ted's business also had a human face and a moral face and a social face. It wasn't just about making money and building an empire.\" She adds, sadly, \"He's been shunted aside.\"\n\nEven Turner talks about himself in a retrospective cadence: \"My business side is coming to a close. It's time for me to move on, anyway.\" Last May, after AOL and Time Warner announced the new management structure, Robert Pittman tried to debunk press speculation that Turner was unhappy, saying, \"I think Ted's going to have more influence than he had before.\" Now Pittman, who was born in Mississippi and has spent weekends hunting with Turner, says, \"For me, Ted has a very big role. I don't make major decisions about Turner Broadcasting without talking to Ted.\" This is not what Turner thinks. \"They tell me I have moral authority, and that's great,\" he says. He looks down at his tie, which is decorated with orange bison, and goes on to say, wistfully, \"I'm very busy. Over the last three to four years, I've created another life for myself, and even if they had offered me the chairmanship of the company I probably wouldn't have taken it. It would require all my time, and I'd have to move to New York and I don't want that. I've got this other stuff that I think is in many ways more important.\"\n\nIn March, Turner's business influence was further diminished when the parent company announced that his top lieutenants at Turner Broadcasting-Terence McGuirk, the chairman and C.E.O., and Steven J. Heyer, the president-would be replaced by Jamie Kellner, the chief executive and founder of the WB broadcast network. To achieve more of the company's much touted synergies, Turner Broadcasting would be folded into a combined broadcast-and-cable-television division, which would be run by Kellner; Kellner would move to Atlanta from Hollywood. In a press release, Turner applauded Kellner's promotion. He was pleased that the separate fiefdoms in his old company and Time Warner would be joined-he blames Levin for wanting \"to keep everybody weak, so he could be stronger\"-but sorry that AOL Time Warner was practicing what he thinks of as management by the numbers.\n\nSince Turner's dismissal, his offices, at the CNN Center, in Atlanta, and at Time Warner's headquarters, at 75 Rockefeller Plaza, have been largely idle. Friends notice that his shoulders slope more, that his hair has turned white, that his hearing is worse, that he complains about pain in his back and his foot, that he is self-conscious about his age. His energy level has decreased, along with his business authority. He is a member of the company's official executive committee, but it meets just once a month; the core corporate executive committee meets for lunch every Monday without him.\n\nLink copied\n\nStill, the needy side of Turner compels him to want to please. Before an Advertising Council dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria last November in honor of Turner and Levin, Turner stood awkwardly beside Levin in a receiving line. As they turned to enter the ballroom, Turner pointed to me and told Levin that I was writing about him. Levin said he knew, and that prompted Turner to reassure him: \"I checked first with corporate communications. I would not have done this unless I had approval.\" Such behavior does not surprise Jane Fonda. Turner is insecure, she says, noting that the man who thinks of himself as Rhett Butler is really the more vulnerable character in his favorite movie: \"He loves 'Gone with the Wind' for lots of reasons, and one of them is that he identifies with Scarlett O'Hara.\"\n\nRick Kaplan, who was fired as president of CNN/U.S. last September, recalls being taken to lunch by Turner at a Southern-kitchen restaurant, where \"you thought you were walking in with Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium.\" For the first time, Kaplan noticed, Turner talked mostly about the past: \"Whenever I had spent any time with him, he'd always talk about the future. All of a sudden, gone from his conversation were dreams for the future. And he was supposed to be there to make me feel better. Instead, I left feeling worse for him. I spent more time telling him positive, uplifting things, telling him the truth-that people revere him and it doesn't matter what his title is and it doesn't matter what anyone says his responsibilities are. Ted could sell all his stock, divest himself of every nickel he's got, and if he walked into the CNN newsroom the place would stand at attention.\"\n\nPerhaps, but in the new world of AOL Time Warner it is probably not premature to write Ted Turner's business obituary.\n\nThe first word that Robert Edward Turner III uttered was not \"mama\" or \"dada\" but \"pretty.\" It was an odd choice, since he also remembers that, growing up in the shadow of the Second World War, he yearned first to be a fighter pilot with the R.A.F., and then to conquer the world, like his first hero, Alexander the Great. Turner was born in 1938 in Cincinnati; a sister, Mary Jane, was born three years later. His father, Robert Edward (Ed) Turner, Jr., ran a successful outdoor-advertising company. Ted's mother was a dutiful wife, who tried to obey her husband's wishes. Ed Turner was a charming, gifted salesman who was on the road or at work far more than he was at home. He was propelled by the memory of his own father, a cotton farmer in Mississippi, who lost his farm in the Depression and, refusing to declare bankruptcy, became a sharecropper instead. Often, Ed Turner would warn his son that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman were Communists and that the Communists would take over America and execute anyone with more than fifty dollars in his pocket. For years, Ted never carried around more than forty-nine dollars.\n\nTed was obstreperous. He pulled ornaments off the Christmas tree, and smeared mud on a neighbor's sheets that were hanging out to dry. His father instructed him to read two books each week, and to eat every vegetable on his plate. Ed was often drunk, and would fly into a rage when Ted disobeyed; he frequently beat him, sometimes with a wire coat hanger. He would untwist it until it was straight, like a whip, and then hit his son, exclaiming, \"This hurts me more than it does you.\" When this didn't seem to tame Ted, he reversed the punishment, pulling down his pants, lying down, and ordering his son to administer the lashings. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Ted obeyed. \"It was the most painful thing I ever did in my entire life,\" he recalls, giving his father credit for understanding that \"that would be a more effective punishment than him beating me.\"\n\nApparently, it was not effective enough; when Ed Turner joined the Navy, during the Second World War, and was assigned to the Gulf Coast, the family joined him-except for young Ted, who stayed with his grandmother and was eventually sent to boarding school in Cincinnati. Ted was miserable; he was impossible to control, and was suspended. When he was about ten, the family moved to Savannah, Georgia. Intent on teaching his son obedience, Ed Turner became more formal, no longer hugging him but greeting him with a handshake. He sent Ted off to the Georgia Military Academy, outside Atlanta, and then to the military program at the McCallie School, in Chattanooga.\n\nTed read non-stop, committing poems and military history to memory, but he hated boarding school. \"I was hurt,\" he told me. \"I didn't want to go off so young. It was like a prison. You couldn't leave the campus. There was a bell when you got out of bed in the morning and a bell to go to meals, and a bell to go to bed at night.\" And, he added, \"there were no parents there-no mom, no dad.\" Yet Turner defends and even romanticizes his harsh father, saying that he deliberately instilled insecurity: \"He thought that people who were insecure worked harder, and I think that's probably true. I don't think I ever met a superachiever who wasn't insecure to some degree. A superachiever is somebody that's never satisfied.\"\n\nBy the time he was a teen-ager, Ted knew that he did not want to join his father's business. He was religious, and he decided that he was going to be a missionary. Then his sister became ill. He was fifteen when Mary Jane, who was twelve, contracted systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's tissue. She was racked with pain and constantly vomiting, and her screams filled the house. Ted regularly came home and held her hand, trying to comfort her. He prayed for her recovery; she prayed to die. After years of misery, she succumbed. Ted lost his faith. \"I was taught that God was love and God was powerful,\" he says, \"and I couldn't understand how someone so innocent should be made or allowed to suffer so.\"\n\nThe experience transformed Turner. \"I decided I wanted to be a success,\" he says. Though he wasn't much of an athlete, he became a good boxer; the same tenacity that enabled him to resist his father helped him in boxing, because, he recalls, \"I could take punishment.\" To impress his father, he took up debating and excelled at it; as a senior, he won the state high-school debating championship. He also became an accomplished sailor.\n\nEd Turner was constantly giving his son instructions: where he should work during the summers, whom he should date, how he had to save to pay his college tuition. When Ted was at home, his father even charged him room and board. Expecting his son to attend Harvard, he was displeased when a rejection letter arrived. Ted was accepted at Brown, and that mollified his father, but not for long. According to a detailed account of Ted's Brown years in Robert and Gerald Jay Goldberg's \"Citizen Turner,\" he wasn't much of a student. He gambled. He got into noisy arguments, defending the South, defending war as a means of ridding the planet of the weak, defending nationalism. He delighted in irritating liberal sensibilities. He kept a rifle in his room, and sometimes poked it out the dormitory window and fired off a round or two. He partied and drank too much. He talked about dates as if he were describing military conquests. But Ted could be charming and funny, and, as is still the case, he was hard to miss. He joined the Brown sailing team, and was named the best freshman sailor in New England.\n\nHis father, who had divorced Ted's mother in 1957 and was now remarried, tried, in his son's word, to \"micromanage\" his life, to treat college as preparation for a business career. When Ted chose to major in classics, his father wrote angrily:\n\nI am appalled, even horrified, that you have adopted Classics as a Major. As a matter of fact, I almost puked on the way home today. . . . I am a practical man, and for the life of me I cannot possibly understand why you should wish to speak Greek. With whom will you communicate in Greek? I have read, in recent years, the deliberations of Plato and Aristotle, and was interested to learn that the old bastards had minds which worked very similarly to the way our minds work today. I was amazed that they had so much time for deliberating and thinking and was interested in the kind of civilization that would permit such useless deliberation. . . . I suppose everybody has to be a snob of some sort, and I suppose you will feel that you are distinguishing yourself from the herd by becoming a Classical snob. I can see you drifting into a bar, belting down a few, turning around to a guy on the stool next to you-a contemporary billboard baron from Podunk, Iowa-and saying, \"Well, what do you think about old Leonidas?\" . . . It isn't really important what I think. It's important what you wish to do with the rest of your life. I just wish I could feel that the influence of those odd-ball professors and the ivory towers were developing you into the kind of man we can both be proud of. . . . I think you are rapidly becoming a jackass, and the sooner you get out of that filthy atmosphere, the better it will suit me.\n\nLink copied\n\nAgitated by the letter, Ted brought it to the Brown student newspaper, the Daily Herald , and, as Porter Bibb says in his biography \"Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy As It Looks,\" the paper published it anonymously.\n\nIn his junior year, Ted was expelled for smuggling a coed into his room. In fact, it was just the last straw, and, if Ed Turner was unhappy with his son's behavior, he was glad to have him come home and enter the billboard business. Despite their feuds, Ted now rarely questioned that he would work for his father. \"I liked the advertising business,\" he said. Father and son were similar in many ways. Both were persuasive and headstrong. Both viewed seduction as a game of conquest. Both were self-centered. Both were political conservatives. Both liked whiskey. Both battled moments of depression. And both had unsuccessful marriages.\n\nIn 1960, after a brief stint in the Coast Guard, Ted married Julia (Judy) Gale Nye, the daughter of a prominent sailor from Chicago, and they moved to Macon. A year later, when she gave birth to Laura Lee, Ted, intent on winning the America's Cup, was off sailing. Marriage did not stop him from carousing, and he often returned home late at night, as if in a Playboy cartoon, with lipstick on his collar and alcohol on his breath. Two years after they were married, Judy filed for divorce. Then she discovered that she was pregnant again, and the couple reconciled. In May of 1963, Robert Edward Turner IV was born. Ted soon returned to his earlier habits, and finally, after a sailing competition in which he rammed his wife's boat in order to win, Judy decided that the marriage was finished.\n\nTurner was a Barry Goldwater supporter, and he met his second wife, Jane Smith, who was a stewardess based in Atlanta, at a campaign rally. They married in June of 1964, and had three children in short order-Rhett, Beauregard, and Jennie. In 1967, Ted also got custody of the two children from his first marriage. The Turners lived in Atlanta, and Ted was not much better as a father than he was as a husband. He was \"a dictator,\" Laura, who is now close to her father, recalls. Because of the sailing season, he was rarely home for Christmas, and because of work the family took few vacations together. In the summer, because Turner refused to install air-conditioning, the family baked. But, Ted says, recalling his own father, \"I treated my children entirely differently than he did. I let them make a lot of their decisions for themselves.\" Yet he had sudden mood changes, and his temper frightened the children. They were expected to be in bed by 8 P . M . and at breakfast before eight. Good manners were required at the table. Television was limited. If they wanted soda or candy on the weekend, they collected empty bottles to earn the money.\n\nWhile Ted Turner concentrated on mastering the outdoor-advertising business, his father was trying to escape depression; he drank, smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, and took a huge assortment of pills. In 1961, Ed Turner had sought treatment, and he spent a summer at the Silver Hill psychiatric hospital, in New Canaan, Connecticut. A year after he left Silver Hill, Ed Turner made the boldest business decision of his career, paying four million dollars for the Atlanta, Richmond, and Roanoke divisions of General Outdoor Advertising. Instantly, Turner Advertising was the foremost outdoor-advertising company in the South.\n\nTed was convinced that they had scored a coup. His father, though, was strangely morose, worrying that he lacked the resources to absorb such a large company. He returned to Silver Hill, and from there placed a panicky call to a friend in the outdoor-advertising business and pressed him to buy the new divisions for the amount they had cost him. The friend, not wanting to take advantage, threw in a fifty-thousand-dollar bonus. Ed Turner still could not shake his depression. \"I don't want to hurt anybody. I just feel like I've lost my guts,\" he wrote to his wife. On March 5, 1963, Ed Turner had breakfast with his wife, went upstairs, placed a .38-calibre silver pistol in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. He was fifty-three.\n\nHis son later told Christian Williams, who wrote an early biography of him, that he and his father \"had terrible, terrible fights. It was after one of those fights-we disagreed about how the business should be run-that he blew his brains out.\" The message was clear: Ed Turner abandoned his dreams of business glory because he felt inadequate, and because his son wasn't up to the task, either. The son, who was twenty-four, had to face another message: perhaps he was responsible. For all that, Ted Turner says that he lost his \"best friend.\"\n\nIn the weeks and months after his father's suicide, Turner was distraught yet surprisingly focussed. He told his father's advisers and bankers that Ed Turner had not known what he was doing when he resold the company divisions he had just bought; that he, Ted, would sue if necessary to reclaim them; and that, in any case, he was prepared to run the entire enterprise. His ferocity and his mastery of the numbers were impressive. The bankers came through with the loans, and his father's friend sold back the divisions he had bought.\n\nSoon after that, Turner began to dream of going beyond the billboard business, of building a media empire. His first venture came five years after his father's suicide, in 1968, when he bought a Chattanooga radio station, WAPO. Within a year, he had also acquired radio stations in Jacksonville and Charleston. In 1970, he acquired his first television property, Channel 17 in Atlanta, a money-losing UHF station. He borrowed heavily to make the purchase, and the consensus was that he had been outsmarted; although he changed the station's call letters from WJRJ to WTCG, it looked as if he would lose everything. \"Working in UHF television at that time was like being in the French Foreign Legion,\" recalls Terry McGuirk, who was hired by Turner the summer after his junior year at Middlebury College, and who became Turner's protégé. The staff consisted of about thirty employees; for many, the pay was thirty dollars a week and all you could eat. The finances became even more dire when Turner acquired a second TV station, in Charlotte. McGuirk, who was dispatched to sell ads, says that the new station was costing Turner fifty thousand dollars a month. And a good deal of the time Turner was away sailing, a hobby that commanded nearly as much of his attention as business did. But he managed to motivate his tiny staff, just as he did his sailing crew.\n\nTurner charmed and wheedled to get ads, and he introduced inexpensive programming. News was alien to the man who would become identified with CNN-too negative, Turner complained-and at first it was aired only in the early-morning hours. Turner programmed \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and Three Stooges movies and every sports event he could find. Although profits were slim, he became obsessed with broadcasting. He wanted a national network, and, since he couldn't afford a broadcast network (there were none for sale, anyway), he discovered a way to get one on the cheap. In 1975, Gerald Levin, of Home Box Office, which was then a regional cable service, owned by Time Inc., that offered movies to subscribers, decided that he could transform HBO into a national pay-TV network by distributing it over the newly launched RCA satellite: all he had to do was get cable operators to invest a hundred thousand dollars in a thirty-foot dish. At the time, broadcast-TV stations like Turner's Channel 17 relied on microwave signals that bounced off transmission towers. Turner, however, had a tower that was twice the height of most other such towers, and his station already reached beyond its broadcast range, of forty miles, to five states. But a network of towers was expensive, and the signals were impeded by tall buildings and deteriorated over long distances.\n\nClockwise from top right: Turner with his first wife, Judy Nye; his second wife, Jane Smith; and his father.\n\nCable had other advantages: unlike broadcasting, which produced revenue solely from advertising, it had monthly subscription charges. But cable in those days had little programming of its own; it had started as a way to improve TV reception, and then became a way to extend television to rural communities that didn't get broadcast signals. Turner saw an opportunity. With satellites, as HBO had demonstrated, signals could be sent across the nation, and so Channel 17 could become a cable network. He renamed the new network TBS-Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nTurner was taking not only a huge business risk-he borrowed heavily-but a political risk, too, since he needed approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The broadcast networks and the local TV stations were implacably opposed. They were joined by the Hollywood studios, which complained that Turner would be paying a local price for their movies and exhibiting them nationally, and by professional sports teams, which said that Turner was stealing their product.\n\nTurner and others in the cable industry saw the broadcast networks and their allies as a cartel that had induced the government to impose regulations crippling cable's ability to compete. Cable conventions at that time were like revival meetings, with speaker after speaker fervently denouncing this satan. As a master salesman, Turner knew that Congress had long been concerned about the pervasive power of Hollywood and the three big New York-based broadcast networks, and he assured congressional leaders that he, a broadcaster, was trying to help the nascent cable industry provide consumers with more choices-and better choices, too, since his station would not, he vowed, program violent, sexually explicit movies, like Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver.\" Of course, viewers would not be receiving first-class alternative fare, since Turner was offering movies and sports in the evening and \"Lassie,\" \"The Munsters,\" and \"The Flintstones,\" among other programs, during the day. Nevertheless, the F.C.C. allowed tiny Channel 17 to become the Superstation, an overnight rival to the networks.\n\nCable was starved for programming, and TBS and HBO became its building blocks. To insure continuous baseball coverage that could not be taken off his Superstation, Turner, in 1976, bought the Atlanta Braves; although he paid a bargain price of ten million dollars, he went into debt to do it. He attended most Braves home games: he ran out onto the field to lead the fans in \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\"; sitting behind the Braves dugout, he'd spit Red Man tobacco juice into a cup and swill beer, in hot weather peeling off his shirt; when a Brave hit a home run, he'd jump over the railing and rush to the plate to greet him; he played cards with his players and insisted that they call him Ted. Ralph Roberts, the founder of Comcast Communications, which is now the nation's third-largest cable company, says of TBS, \"We thought it was the greatest thing in the world.\" Roberts was charmed by Turner; others were not. Turner would drop to the floor, histrionically, to beg for business; once, telling a roomful of Southern ladies how to woo advertisers, he explained, \"My daddy said, 'If advertisers want a blow job, you get down on your knees.' \"\n\nHe became Captain Outrageous. Celebrating his victory in the 1977 America's Cup, he swigged almost a whole bottle of aquavit that had been given to him by the Swedish team, and then, drinking champagne, pulled his shirt up to his neck and yelled at some nearby women, \"Show me your tits!\" Earlier that same year, his second as a team owner, the baseball commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, suspended him for the season, accusing him of tampering when he tried to sign a player who was under contract to another team.\n\nTurner tales became legendary. While racing in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1978, Turner coaxed the French-born Frédérique D'arragon-then, as now, a girlfriend-to wait until their boat came to the reviewing stand and then jump naked into the water. Jimmy Carter remembers that when he became President, in 1977, he invited his fellow-Georgian to state dinners. \"He was very raucous,\" Carter said. \"He was loud, and he interrupted sedate proceedings.\" Carter was amused by Turner. Dick Cavett, on the other hand, was not. During a taping of his television show, Cavett pressed him: \"You are a colorful, boisterous, sometimes inebriated playboy type. Maybe it's an act or it's created by the press, but that is your image. You wouldn't deny that, would you?\"\n\n\"I have heard that you are a little twinkle-toed TV announcer,\" Turner responded. \"Would you deny that?\"\n\nBy the late seventies, Turner was rich, and although he still behaved in unconventional ways, he had become more serious. He had great respect for Jimmy Carter, and no doubt Carter's more liberal views affected Turner's own politics. He began to liken himself to \"an ambassador for good will.\" He saw himself as a rabbit-\"a rabbit that's small and fast. All my big competitors were like a pack of wolves, and they were all chasing me, but I was fast enough to be out in front of them.\" The emblem of the rabbit was Turner's brand-new Cable News Network.\n\nReese Schonfeld, a creative and prickly executive, had discussed the cable-news-channel idea with Turner in 1978, and he served as CNN's first president. Turner, who was generous with his money but cheap in sharing credit with Schonfeld, told cable operators that CNN would do for the cable industry what Edward R. Murrow and Huntley-Brinkley had done for network news. CNN would make news the star, not overpaid anchors, and it would not be clotted with ads. Schonfeld travelled the country to sign up cable operators. And at most cable conventions there was Ted Turner, to make a speech and inspire his cable army.\n\nThe new cable network, based in Atlanta, made its official début on June 1, 1980, with three military bands striking up music and a nervous Ted Turner standing at a lectern in a blue blazer. Sporting Elvis sideburns, he began by reciting \"a little poem that was written by Ed Kessler,\" and that reflected CNN's mission: \"To act upon one's convictions while others wait, to create a positive force in a world where cynics abound, to provide information to people when it wasn't available before.\" A band played \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and when it ended Turner whooped \"Awww-riiight!\" and CNN went live.\n\nCNN's production values were initially amateurish-\"video wallpaper,\" or \"talking heads,\" network news executives sneered-and ratings were poor. Most of the work of building a staff, imposing news values, and winning clearance from local cable operators was taken on by Schonfeld. But Turner was the galvanizer, the risk-taker. He practically lived in his office, hurrying through the newsroom and rarely spending more than thirty seconds with anyone. Nick Charles, a sports reporter who was one of the first people to be hired at CNN, recalls that most of the staff worked six or seven days a week and relied on portable toilets outside, and that employees would show up in the morning and see Ted, wearing a robe or wrapped in a towel, wandering out of his office, where he slept on a Murphy bed, to retrieve coffee from the newsroom. Once, Steve Heyer remembers, he walked into Turner's office and the great man was sitting at his desk stark naked. \"Don't get up!\" someone exclaimed. Nick Charles recalls, \"He was much more than a cheerleader. He was the kind of guy you'd want to run through a wall for.\"\n\nAt first, many CNN employees were dubious. Daniel Schorr, a former CBS correspondent, who was hired early on, was worried every time he heard Turner extoll the importance of good news, as if what he wanted were more happy news. Worry spread when, in 1982, Turner, frustrated by Schonfeld's close-to-the-vest management style and ownerlike ego, abruptly fired him. Lou Dobbs, another CNN pioneer, who was a business-news anchor, remembered Turner as a drunken sailor and thought that he might not be \"the right fellow to lead the effort.\" Dobbs was afraid that Turner was more an \"eccentric\" than a \"visionary\"-until he got to know him. \"He is a natural-born leader,\" Dobbs says. \"I once asked him his definition of a leader. He said, 'A leader has the ability to create infectious enthusiasm.' \"\n\nClockwise from top left: Turner with Jane Fonda; at his ranch; and with Frédérique D'arragon.\n\nCNN started as an all-day, mostly live, and mostly domestic news service. But it strayed to cover Cuba's 1981 May Day parade and a speech by Fidel Castro, and that led to an invitation for Turner to visit the island. Turner, who had never been to a Communist country, and whose politics continued to soften, was curious about it, and the next year he accepted the invitation. For the better part of four days, the Cuban Communist and the Southern conservative hung out, smoking cigars, attending a baseball game, duck hunting, visiting schools, discussing politics, and night-clubbing. To an associate, Turner said, \"Fidel ain't a Communist. He's a dictator, just like me.\" He learned that Castro watched CNN's signal from southern Florida; ever the salesman, he persuaded Castro to tape a promotional spot. Castro, in turn, urged Turner to take his news service worldwide. \"Ted came back fired up,\" Eason Jordan remembers. International news quickly expanded-CNN sent its first signal to Asia in late 1982 and to Europe in 1985. Jordan was twenty-eight when he started running CNN's foreign-news coverage.\n\nIn the beginning, the broadcast networks refused to include CNN in their pooled coverage of White House events. Turner filed a federal lawsuit in Atlanta against the \"cartel\" and the Reagan Administration, claiming violations of the antitrust laws and of CNN's rights under the First Amendment. To build support for CNN in Congress, Turner spent thirteen thousand dollars to install a satellite dish for the House and cabled the office of each member of Congress. Because CNN had twenty-four hours of news to fill, a congressman had a much better chance of being seen there. Ted Turner would win the battle for public support; more important, in a landmark ruling in the spring of 1982, the Atlanta court declared in CNN's favor, and by the mid-eighties CNN's triumph was apparent.\n\nOne reason for Turner's success-with CNN, with the Superstation, with buying sports teams to supply cable programming-is identified by Bob Wright, the president and C.E.O. of NBC. \"He sees the obvious before most people do,\" Wright says. \"We all look at the same picture, but Ted sees what you don't see. And after he sees it, it becomes obvious to everyone.\" As the networks shrank their overseas bureaus, CNN expanded. It invested in \"flyaway\" portable satellite dishes, costing about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars each, that could be carried in a suitcase and used anywhere in the world to \"uplink\" to a satellite. Turner wanted to grow bigger still. Although Turner Broadcasting had a mere two hundred and eighty-two million dollars in revenue in 1984, and the New York banks spurned his request for credit, in 1985 Turner got junk-bond financing that enabled him to make a $5.4-billion offer for a broadcast network: CBS.\n\nKnowing that he was an underdog, Turner sought political support from Senator Jesse Helms, of North Carolina. Helms had mounted a campaign against CBS's \"liberal bias,\" and he encouraged Turner to meet with a group called Fairness in Media, which had sent letters to a million conservatives begging them to buy CBS stock and \"become Dan Rather's boss.\" Up North, many in the media expressed horror at the prospect of Turner, whom they regarded as an unsophisticated Southerner-a redneck-owning \"the Tiffany network.\" Thomas Wyman, who was the C.E.O. of CBS, questioned Turner's moral fitness to run a network and accused him of being in bed with ideological groups, although he didn't name any. Wyman and CBS, hoping to block Turner, welcomed the \"white knight\" financing of Laurence Tisch, of the Loews Corporation, and Tisch stealthily gained control of CBS.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, however, Turner was not the provincial portrayed by CBS. As he sought to build CNN overseas, he became much more of an internationalist; he was more concerned with saving the environment, eradicating poverty, and ending the Cold War. He met and became friends with Jacques Cousteau, the primatologist Jane Goodall, the civil-rights leader Andrew Young, and the environmentalist Russell Peterson. \"I was hanging around with people who cared about the future of the planet, both of the human race and of the environment,\" he says. \"And they had an impact on me.\" Although he had once been a smoker, he now refused to hire anyone who smoked. \"I figured any young person who's dumb enough to smoke is too dumb to work at CNN or TBS,\" he says. In 1985, he established the Better World Society, whose purpose was to subsidize documentaries on the dangers of environmental pollution, nuclear weapons, and the population explosion. He also began to proselytize for an end to the Cold War. After the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics, following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union withdrew from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, Turner financed and launched the Goodwill Games to foster athletic competition between the United States and the U.S.S.R. During this time, Turner even thought of running for President.\n\nBut to those who didn't know him-and even to some members of his board, who did-Turner was still often seen as Captain Outrageous. They were tired of hearing that he was going to own a network or a Hollywood studio, that he was going to make movies like \"Gone with the Wind.\" So when, in August of 1985, Turner, without fully consulting his board, bought, for a billion and a half dollars, the M-G-M film studio, its Culver City lot, and its library of more than thirty-five hundred motion pictures the consensus was that he had overpaid. The financing for his impulsive decision was arranged by Drexel Burnham's junk-bond king, Michael Milken, who was representing both Turner and the owner of M-G-M, Kirk Kerkorian. Milken reduced the amount of cash Turner needed by persuading Kerkorian to accept stock in Turner Broadcasting. The difficulty was that Turner found himself with two billion dollars' worth of debt; within three months, he was forced to sell the studio and other parts of M-G-M back to Kerkorian, for three hundred million dollars.\n\nHe kept the film library, however, and he brilliantly exploited this asset. The movies became a source of cheap television programming, and Turner created new cable networks-such as TNT (Turner Network Television), launched in 1988, and TCM (Turner Classic Movies), in 1994-to showcase them. Looking back, he is pleased with himself for having done this \"right under the networks' noses\" and for having managed to grow \"from one-thousandth the size of the networks to two and a half times bigger.\" He says, \"They laughed at me when I started with CBS. They laughed at me when I started CNN. They laughed at me when I bought the Braves. They laughed at me when I bought the Hawks. They laughed at me when I bought M-G-M. I spent a lot of time thinking, and I did not fear, because of my classical background. When Alexander the Great took control when his dad died, he was twenty years old. He took the Macedonian Army, which was the best army in the world at the time, and conquered Greece, got the Greeks to all join with him, and then marched across the Hellespont and invaded Asia. They didn't even know where the world ended at that time. And he was dead at thirty-three, thirteen years later. He kept marching. He hardly ever stopped. And he never lost a battle.\"\n\nTurner did lose battles, even if they were within the company. Kerkorian, it was revealed, had a stipulation that if Turner did not reduce his debt within six months he would have to pay Kerkorian in TBS stock, and Turner worried that Kerkorian could soon gain control of his company. On top of this, companies like Rupert Murdoch's were turning a raptor's eye on the debt-ridden Turner empire. To avoid losing everything, Turner, in 1987, looked to a consortium of thirty-one cable companies-in particular, T.C.I. and Time Inc.'s cable subsidiary-for a bailout. In return for more than five hundred million dollars in cash, Turner ceded more than one-third ownership to them; he also granted the cable executives seven of fifteen board seats and an effective veto over any expenditure exceeding two million dollars. \"In hindsight, you could say that Ted lost his company,\" Terry McGuirk says. \"But, at the time, it was in many ways Nirvana, because Ted partnered with his best customers.\" Turner, however, wanted to expand, and his new partners did not. They wanted to protect Turner's programming assets for the cable industry and keep them away from broadcast rivals. Or they wanted the assets for themselves.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner had watched as, in 1985 and 1986, Murdoch formed the Fox network, and CBS, NBC, and ABC got new owners. Increasingly frustrated, he began to spend even more time away from Atlanta. Whenever he wanted to do something bold-buy a studio or a network, for example-he confronted a veto from his board. Decisions about acquisitions were made by committee. One of the few acquisitions that the board approved, in 1991, and only after Turner wore board members down, was of Hanna-Barbera, whose animation library included more than a third of all the animated cartoons ever made in this country; with this library, Turner was able to create the now thriving Cartoon Network.\n\nWhen it came to programming decisions, Turner remained in charge. Brad Siegel, the president of Turner's Entertainment Networks, remembers that when, in 1993, he was hired to run TNT Turner involved himself in such questions as what programs provided the proper lead-ins for 8 P . M . adult dramas. \"One of the great things about Ted is that he watches everything,\" Siegel says. \"Everything we make on the entertainment side-the pilots, the movies, the specials-Ted watches everything on tape. You always got a call.\" And when the ratings were poor but the program was good-as when TNT aired a \"David Copperfield\" movie-Turner congratulated Siegel.\n\nTurner's most visible success came ten years after CNN went on the air-with its coverage of the Gulf War. Unlike the other networks, CNN made a financial commitment to cover any potential war from ground zero, Baghdad. Eason Jordan figured that the Iraqi communications system would be taken out in any allied air raid, so he recommended that CNN invest in a suitcase version of a satellite phone; this expenditure, of fifty-two thousand dollars, would be added to the extra millions that CNN was committed to spend to cover what might be the first live war. Tom Johnson, a former Los Angeles Times publisher, had taken over as president of CNN on August 1, 1990; the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait came on his second day at work. Johnson recalls going to Turner with various spending plans for war coverage. He asked Turner, \"What am I authorized to spend?\"\n\n\"You spend whatever you think it takes, pal,\" Turner said. Johnson was amazed, especially because, he recalls, \"I'm not even sure he remembered my name.\"\n\nJohnson posted people around the clock in Baghdad and Amman and Saudi Arabia and Israel and the White House and the Pentagon and the State Department. CNN, he says, spent twenty-two million dollars covering the war. CNN got permission from the Iraqi government to circumvent the Al Rashid Hotel switchboard and set up a four-wire telephone transmission from Baghdad to Amman, and then to Atlanta. When the United States destroyed the telephone system in Baghdad, only CNN had a telephone. When the Bush Administration urged the broadcast networks to pull their crews out of Iraq, they complied. Tom Johnson tells how he received calls from President Bush and other government officials, urging him to leave Baghdad, and how vexing this was. When he met with Turner and told him about these calls, and about two bureau chiefs who had been killed when he was at the Los Angeles Times , Turner was unmoved. He told Johnson, \"I will take on myself the responsibility for anybody who is killed. I'll take it off of you if it's on your conscience.\" Johnson adds, \"I, frankly, was about to order them back to Amman. I thought they'd all get killed.\"\n\nNo one got killed. And Turner was acclaimed as a different kind of businessman, one who thought about more than profit margins. When he commissioned a CNN documentary series, of more than twenty hours, on the Cold War, Rick Kaplan says, \"his attitude was, if we break even on 'The Cold War' it would still be an enormous success.\" Turner understood, in a way that many corporate leaders do not, that building a brand can be expensive.\n\nIn the late eighties, Turner's personal life became happier. Jimmy Carter remembers that he was hunting and fishing with Turner at Avalon, Turner's estate in Tallahassee, Florida, when Turner read that Jane Fonda was planning to divorce Tom Hayden, the sixties activist. Turner told Carter that he had always admired Fonda, as an actor and as an outspoken liberal. \"I think I'm going to ask her for a date,\" he said. When he called, Fonda put him off. She was not yet ready to date, she told Turner, although she was soon photographed at St. Bart's cavorting with an Italian soccer player.\n\nTurner's second marriage had ended in 1988, after twenty-four years, three children, and many dalliances. His dating patterns conformed to his travel schedule; he took up with, among others, a Playboy bunny and the female pilot of his private plane. Turner was persistent with Fonda, and finally, in late 1989, they had their first date. It was followed by many others, including an Academy Awards ceremony, a White House dinner, a Kremlin dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev. They went horseback riding at Turner's Montana ranches; later, Turner, with Fonda by his side, would point out a cabin to visitors and announce that this was where they first made love. Both were famous, opinionated, rich, and attractive. Both loved the outdoors. Both had endured difficult childhoods under severe fathers. Neither finished college. And both felt profound guilt after the suicide of a parent; Fonda's mother had slashed her own throat at the age of forty-two. \"She is fiercely focussed and full of idealism and, like all of us, full of insecurities, too. And so is he,\" the former Colorado senator Tim Wirth, who is a friend of both, says. \"She reinforced all the best qualities in him. And she said to me the sweetest thing. She said, 'You know, Ted is the only person who's apologized more than I have.' They are really good, vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe couple held hands on Larry King's CNN program. They kissed in public. Turner brought her to CNN executive meetings and they sent mash notes to each other. She got him to drink less and diet more, to spruce up his wardrobe and buy art for his houses. Turner's mood swings became less pronounced; he yelled less, and he stopped taking lithium, which he had been on for about three years because, he says, \"a quack\" psychiatrist misdiagnosed him as \"manic.\"\n\nTurner and Fonda married in December of 1991 at his Florida estate, where bride and groom wore white and were surrounded by their children; they dined on fresh quail that Fonda had shot herself, candied yams, collard greens, and corn bread. Turner hates being alone, so Fonda moved to Atlanta. For much of the next decade, she was at his side. In Montana, Turner announced that he was getting rid of his cattle and sheep and returning the land to bison, the animals that grazed there two centuries ago. Fonda became an enthusiastic hunter. Gerald Levin, who says that he is \"constitutionally opposed to killing animals,\" remembers how, on a visit to one of Turner's properties, he learned that Fonda had shot a deer and loaded it into a pickup truck. \"I was appalled,\" Levin says. \"It was Bambi in the back of the truck!\"\n\nIn Atlanta, Turner did not live in a grand style. He poked a hole in the roof of the CNN Center building and put in a spiral staircase to connect the office to what has been called a penthouse but is really a seven-hundred-square-foot efficiency apartment, with a cramped bedroom. (One wall of the bedroom is a two-hundred-gallon saltwater fish tank, on the other side of which is the living room.) The most striking features of the apartment are a terrace, largely unused, with sweeping views of downtown (for a long while, Turner says, he \"was the only downtown resident-except homeless people!\"), and a photograph-one of the few on display-of Ed Turner looking up adoringly at his son. Turner had slept in his old office for a decade; this apartment allowed him to walk to work and to order room service from the Omni Hotel. To accommodate Fonda, he converted the bedroom closet into a windowless office for her-\"a storage closet,\" Fonda called it.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I learned a lot from Jane,\" Turner says. Laura Seydel, his eldest daughter, explains that her father only reluctantly celebrated Christmas and, until he married Fonda, did not invest time in planning family gatherings. Soon Fonda and Turner and his five children and their families had reunions twice a year, and swapped Christmas presents, and attended church christenings. Laura and her husband, Rutherford Seydel II, live in Atlanta with three young children and are active in charitable activities; Seydel works as a lawyer for Turner. He and Laura think of Turner as a great man, but he was not always a great family man. After he married Fonda, however, Grandpa Turner was around more.\n\nTurner was surprised but not displeased that Fonda attracted more attention than he did when they travelled. Fonda says that Turner was never jealous of the notice she received. \"He doesn't have that kind of ego,\" she says. \"He put me on a pedestal. He loved my successes.\" Although he is not an introspective or patient man, Turner probably opened up more to Fonda than he ever had to anyone else, male or female. By most accounts, the marriage was a good one, and Turner's friends and family came to adore Fonda. Laura says, \"She's grandma to our kids. She filmed our firstborn.\" Embraced by senior female executives at Turner Broadcasting, she went on three-day all-\"girls\" trips. \"Her influence was profound,\" Jimmy Carter told me. Carter smiled as he talked about Turner. \"Ted has always been very hyper, in that he's constantly having visions of grandiose things. He was very restless . . . always dreaming. Ted told us he was taking sedation to calm himself. . . . When he and Jane got together, Ted became much more relaxed.\"\n\nIn the early nineties, Turner began worrying once more that his company was too small. The networks had persuaded the government to relax the rules that prohibited them from owning and syndicating TV programs, which is where television fortunes are made. Turner didn't own a studio, and he feared that the studios would reserve their best programs for their networks, starving Turner Broadcasting. Nor could he match the resources of NBC, now owned by G.E., in bidding for world rights to televise the Olympics, or ABC, owned by Disney, in bidding for Monday Night Football. Turner Broadcasting got smaller compared with its competitors. The usual edge of an entrepreneur like Turner-the rabbit's advantage-seemed less vital than size.\n\n\"You need to control everything,\" Turner said one day recently in his New York office, his foot up against an empty coffee table. \"You need to be like Rockefeller with Standard Oil. He had the oil fields, and he had the filling stations, and he had the pipelines and the trucks and everything to get the gas to the stations. And they broke him up as a monopoly. You want to control everything. You want to have a hospital and a funeral home, so when the people die in the hospital you move them right over to the funeral home next door. When they're born, you got 'em. When they're sick, you got 'em. When they die, you got 'em.\" He smiled and added, \"The game's over when they break you up. But in the meantime you play to win. And you know you've won when the government stops you.\"\n\nTurner set his sights once more on buying a studio or a TV network, or arranging a business partnership with one. With John Malone, he tried to buy Paramount. When Viacom won that competition, Turner and Malone explored purchasing ABC and then entered what Turner thought were serious negotiations to acquire NBC; again, some of the cable owners on his board opposed him. Turner says that Gerald Levin, of Time Warner (Time Inc. had merged with Warner Communications in 1990), which owned nineteen per cent of Turner's company, used that position to veto the five-billion-dollar purchase. Levin was straightforward; he said that the interests of separate companies often diverge. If Turner wanted a network, so did Levin, who was planning to launch his own network, WB.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to merge with Ted,\" Malone told me. \"No one wanted to turn control over to Ted.\" This was true of Rupert Murdoch, who had once gone skiing with Turner. \"He is one of the most charming people you'd ever meet,\" Turner says. \"He told me he loved CNN the way it was and if we merged with him he wouldn't change a thing.\" Turner, who detests Murdoch, says that he didn't believe him. (Murdoch declined to comment.) There was a brief courtship by Bill Gates, of Microsoft; Gates thought that the power of CNN's brand could be transformed into an instantly successful online-news site. Turner thought that Microsoft's deep pockets could be used to help finance a bid for CBS. But the talks went nowhere. (Not long after this, Microsoft became a partner in MSNBC.) Meanwhile, Time Warner was determined that, if anyone was going to take over CNN and Turner's assets, it was going to be Time Warner.\n\nWhen Turner is agitated, the people close to him try to prevent him from talking to reporters or giving a speech. Around this time, however, he was scheduled to speak at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington. Jane Fonda says that she was aware of the \"fragility\" of the relationship between Turner and Time Warner. \"One false move and it would fall apart. I didn't sleep that night. Ted slept like a baby.\" When Turner rose to speak, he startled the audience by mentioning a story on clitorectomies that CNN had aired. Suddenly, he started comparing the mutilation of women to what Gerald Levin was doing to him. He cried out, \"You talk about barbaric mutilation. Well, I'm in an angry mood. I'm angry at that, too. I'm being clitorized by Time Warner!\"\n\n\"I slid under my seat,\" Fonda says. Levin, more diplomatically, says, \"Ted is Ted. He not only says what he thinks; he gives the most amazing speeches. While I think his analogy is a little stretched, he was peeved at the time. He actually called me up, and we talked about it. It wasn't a problem.\"\n\nIt was a problem. Turner felt fenced in, as he does when he is handed a speech to read or when he's told that he can't do something. \"My inner dream is to go to the place,\" he starts to explain-and suddenly breaks into the old Roy Rogers theme song-\"where the West commences, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses. . . . Don't fence me in.\" Fences loom large in Turner's mind; he hates them, and that is one reason that his landholdings are so vast. \"I'm happiest when I'm on a horse on my ranch,\" he says. At the same time, he can't stand to be alone.\n\nThis much is clear: by 1995, after thirty-two years in business, Turner no longer felt like a nimble rabbit. In the spring and early summer of that year, Terry McGuirk, representing Turner, tried to extricate Turner Broadcasting from Time Warner. \"I spent about six months negotiating an exit from Time Warner and doing a deal with John Malone,\" McGuirk recalls. But, much as Turner admired Malone, he feared placing CNN in the hands of such a committed conservative. He was also concerned about Malone's business partnerships with Murdoch. Turner's own biases clearly infected CNN. It was an international network that slavishly covered the United Nations, from whose vocabulary, by Turner's dictate, the term \"foreign news\" was banished, that aired documentaries on subjects Turner cared about. People at CNN undoubtedly knew what the boss wanted. But CNN was not used to punishing Turner's foes, as Murdoch's newspapers sometimes did to Murdoch's foes. Turner \"never once had me pull a story,\" Tom Johnson says. Nor, says Gail Evans, the CNN executive vice-president in charge of booking guests, did he ever order executives to help a friend. \"In my twenty years here, Ted has never once asked me to book a guest,\" she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerald Levin had concluded that his company was not big enough; he saw CNN as \"the jewel\" that he could link with Time Warner's magazines. Levin also knew that he had to move fast, before Turner was bought by a competitor. After talking it over with only two members of his team-Richard Parsons, the president, and Richard Bressler, the chief financial officer-Levin phoned Turner and asked if he could fly to Montana to discuss an \"important\" matter.\n\nLink copied\n\nThis was in August of 1995, and by then, Turner says, \"I knew I was selling the company. And there was another reason I did it, too. I was a little bit tired.\" He was tired of his cable partners. Whatever differences he had with Levin, however, Turner knew that Levin cared deeply about journalism, for he was a proud defender of his magazines' independence. Turner also knew that a merger would connect Turner Broadcasting to a Hollywood studio, a giant music company, the country's largest magazine-publishing enterprise, and its foremost cable system.\n\nWhen Levin's plane landed that morning, Jane Fonda picked him up. Although Turner had weekend house guests-including his neighbors Meredith and Tom Brokaw-he and Levin went out on the porch alone and Levin consulted ten or so points he had jotted down on a piece of paper about why Turner and Time Warner were a perfect fit. Turner Broadcasting, he said, \"would be the pivot point in the center of the company,\" and Ted Turner would be a partner, not an employee. When he and Levin walked back into the house and Turner saw Brokaw, who had just arrived, he shouted, \"Hey, buddy. We just made a deal. We're going to merge.\" Brokaw remembers that Levin looked startled when Turner revealed their secret.\n\nTurner had traded a silent boss for a real one. But he still owned almost eleven per cent of the merged company, and he was not timid. He pressed Levin to sell off company airplanes and expensive American art and to curb costs at the Hollywood studio. He stepped in to stop a fifty-million-dollar sale of Warner Bros, movies to CBS, insisting that the Warner films should be offered first to its own cable networks. He won control of all new international channels, preventing Warner Bros. from spending millions to build a staff that would duplicate Turner Broadcasting's. He pushed for across-the-board budget reductions, and, as the Wall Street Journal reported, he even fired his own son, Robert E. (Teddy) Turner IV, who was a promotions manager for Turner Home Entertainment, bluntly warning him over a family dinner, \"You're toast.\"\n\nWhether by design or by accident, Levin began to use Turner for his own purposes. \"The edict from Gerry Levin was 'Let Ted be Ted,'\" a Levin confidant recalls. \"Time Warner was buttoned up and bureaucratic. Ted was a breath of fresh air, and Gerry used that to the advantage of the company.\" When they met with employees, he remembers, \"Ted would get up and say, 'I've got one suit. I don't spend my money on suits. I own ten per cent of the company and each dollar you waste, ten cents comes from me.'\" Levin remembers that he was \"very comfortable\" with Ted's saying whatever he wanted, and had no illusions that it could be any other way. Levin and many other Time Warner executives were pleasantly surprised that Turner was a team player. Within the Turner Broadcasting group, Gail Evans says, Turner didn't change the way he worked, except to occasionally say, \"I have to check with the boss.\"\n\nNo matter how many times Turner checked, however, he and Levin never grew close. They didn't communicate regularly. Turner was hurt that Levin, who is intensely private, never invited him to his home for dinner. They had business differences-Turner, for example, wanted Levin to fold the Warner Bros. television operations into Turner Broadcasting. He still resented Levin's veto of his potential purchase of NBC, believing that if he had succeeded he never would have sold his company and, he laments, \"I'd have bought Time Warner instead of going the other way.\" Levin, who then wore a thick mustache chopped at the ends, as if he'd got tired of shaving, was reclusive and weighed his words carefully; the six-foot-one Turner towered over him and was impulsive. Levin was a schemer; Turner could become so focussed on the moment that sometimes when he got off his horse he dropped the reins and the horse galloped away, leaving him stranded. \"There are probably not two more different individuals that I've ever worked with,\" Terry McGuirk says.\n\nInevitably, perhaps, after the Time Warner merger Turner and Murdoch declared war on each other. Turner said that Murdoch had to be stopped before he took over the media and used them as a weapon to advance his conservative agenda and his business interests. Turner asserts that men of good will can resolve differences between, say, Arabs and Israelis, yet he does not believe that it is possible to play Chamberlain to Murdoch's Hitler. \"How do you make peace with a mega-maniac?\" Turner said to me in a November, 1996, interview. \"Chamberlain tried to make peace. When you've got somebody like that, I don't think there's a spark of human decency in him-except he likes his family.\" Turner said that Murdoch's Fox News network would do in America what Murdoch had done in China, where he removed the BBC from his satellite system in order to gain favor with the government. Murdoch's New York Post taunted Turner, describing him as a doormat for foreign dictators, suggesting that he was wacky, and portraying Fonda as Hanoi Jane. The battle became so ferocious that executives in both camps grew concerned; after all, Fox wanted television shows from Warner Bros. and Warner Bros. needed Murdoch's satellites. Fox would need Time Warner cable systems to carry its new cable news service. In the end, business interests outweighed principles, a truce was arranged, and, though Turner has never altered his view of Murdoch, he began to focus on other things.\n\nWith McGuirk running Turner Broadcasting day to day, Turner had more time. And, with Time Warner's stock price soaring, he also had more money. In September of 1997, he was to be honored by the United Nations Association-USA, and he had the idea of giving a billion dollars-then a third of his wealth-to the United Nations. The Turners were flying to New York when Turner told his wife what he planned. \"I was extremely moved,\" Jane Fonda says, adding that she told her husband, \"Don't you think you should talk to your lawyers first?\" He did, and learned that he could not make the gift directly to the U.N.\n\nThe next day, as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalls, Turner walked into Annan's office and blurted, \"Hi, Kofi. I'm going to give you a billion dollars.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a joke,\" Annan says, shaking his head in wonderment.\n\nThat night, Turner announced that he would give a hundred million dollars a year for ten years to support such U.N. programs as the elimination of land mines, providing medicine for children, and easing the plight of refugees. He hired Tim Wirth, who eventually recruited a staff of thirty-two, to oversee the effort. Turner's only condition was that his money be used only minimally for administrative overhead. Annan remembers that Turner also said, \"All of you billionaires out there, watch out. I'm coming after you.\"\n\nTurner has written his own version of the Ten Commandments, which he keeps on typed cards in his wallet. Without prompting, he will read from a list that includes these vows: \"'I promise to care for planet earth and all living things thereon'; 'I promise to treat all persons everywhere with dignity, respect, and friendliness'; 'I promise to have no more than one or two children'; 'I reject the use of force'; 'I support the United Nations.'\" Along with his manifest generosity, Turner remains enough of a ham to seek a fitting reward: a Nobel Prize. \"I've thought about it a little bit,\" Turner said when I asked him. \"Of course I've thought of it.\"\n\nTurner is easily moved to tears. He sobbed openly when Princess Diana was killed. On a trip to China in October of 1999, with Fonda reading and CNN's Eason Jordan working, Turner put on his headphones and popped in the videotape of a popular Warner Bros. cartoon movie, \"The Iron Giant,\" the story of the friendship between a young boy and a metallic being from outer space who sacrifices himself for the sake of the planet. Jordan remembers looking over at his boss. \"Tears were streaming down his face,\" he says. \"I never saw anybody cry like that in my life.\" As the credits rolled, Turner called out, \"That's the saddest thing I've ever seen!\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAmerica and Russia still have some seven thousand nuclear weapons targeted at each other, and Turner is terrified that these-along with chemical and biological weapons-could fall into the wrong hands. He dismisses the Bush Administration's effort to build an anti-missile defense system as madness; the technology won't work, he says, and, in any case, it won't prevent weapons of mass destruction from being delivered by car, by ship, or in a suitcase. All these dangers are \"off the radar screen,\" he says. \"We have a huge job. Probably ninety-five per cent of the U.S. population doesn't know about it.\" Thus Turner's Nuclear Threat Initiative. To lead it, he has recruited former Senator Sam Nunn, who once chaired the Armed Services Committee, and who signed on only after Turner agreed to allow him a free hand. \"When he gets behind something, people know it's serious, and it's going to have the energy and resources,\" Nunn says. Most days, Turner is a fan of the cautious Nunn; some days, he worries that Nunn is fencing him in.\n\nTurner's miserable last year actually began a few years ago, when Fonda began spending more time in Atlanta and less time with him. She wanted to be with her daughter Vanessa Vadim, who had moved to Atlanta and was raising a child on her own. Fonda's daughter Lulu, whose father was a Black Panther, and whom Jane took in when she and Tom Hayden ran a California camp for troubled kids, had also moved to Atlanta. In addition, Fonda had started the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, and had taken up the cause of nurturing teen mothers. During this time (according to an E! biography of Fonda that aired last fall), Fonda started attending services at the Providence Missionary Baptist Church. Turner, who alternately describes himself as an atheist and an agnostic, told me his reaction: \"I had absolutely no warning about it. She didn't tell me she was thinking about doing it. She just came home and said, 'I've become a Christian.' Before that, she was not a religious person. That's a pretty big change for your wife of many years to tell you. That's a shock. I mean, normally that's the kind of thing your wife or husband would discuss with you before they did it or while they were thinking about it. . . . Obviously, we weren't communicating very well at that time.\"\n\n\"My becoming a Christian upset him very much-for good reason,\" Fonda says. \"He's my husband and I chose not to discuss it with him-because he would have talked me out of it. He's a debating champion. He saw it as writing on the wall. And it was about other things. He knew my daughter was having a baby and it would take me away from him. He needs someone to be there one hundred per cent of the time. He thinks that's love. It is not love. It's babysitting. I didn't want to tell you this. We went in different directions. I grew up.\" Turner's daughter Laura doesn't think religion per se was the real basis of their disagreement. She says, \"It was another male\"-Jesus. \"It took time away from him.\"\n\nThere were other differences, friends of both say, including Turner's libido and his insecurities. \"My problem is I love every woman I meet,\" Turner has said. He and Fonda visited marriage counsellors and psychiatrists, to no avail. On January 4,2000, they announced an official separation; before the announcement, Frédérique D'arragon, who is fifty-one, and has been in and out of Turner's life for more than thirty years, came back into it. She is almost a foot shorter than Turner, and prefers jeans to designer dresses. Fonda and D'arragon had lunch recently in Atlanta, and Fonda makes it clear that D'arragon will be available for Ted in ways she no longer can be: \"He needs to be taken care of. She has no children. And she's loved him a long time.\" But travelling with Ted has taken its toll on D'arragon, just as it did on Fonda. Turner admits that the persistent travel is \"driving her nuts.\"\n\nA close friend says that Turner is burdened by three things: an insecurity that can be traced back to his abusive father; a manic, restless nature; and lust. \"Each one of these is a great huge bear,\" the friend says. \"Turner must wrestle with three bears, and they sometimes overwhelm him.\" Fonda puts it another way: \"Why this guy didn't go under psychologically at age five, I don't know. It scarred him for life. It colors everything-his relationships, his anxieties . . .\"\n\nFonda and Turner insist that they still love each other; in fact, the best I have ever seen Turner look-his white hair washed and carefully combed, his thin white mustache trimmed, a chocolate-brown sports jacket nicely contrasting with pressed gray slacks, a burgundy tie, and brown Gucci loafers-was a December day in Atlanta when he and Fonda had a lunch date. Both friends and family are distressed by their split. But Fonda, despite her own notoriety as an actor and as a political activist, had lived in the shadow of three dominant husbands. By leaving Turner, she also announced her own liberation.\n\nTurner was despondent, and his sense of abandonment was heightened by the announcement, around the same time, that Time Warner was merging with AOL-more accurately, AOL was acquiring Time Warner. The price, based on the stock values of the companies on the day of the announcement, was pegged at a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars, the largest corporate marriage ever. Although Turner had been alerted to the merger discussions, he had not been invited by Gerald Levin to participate. \"Ted was not a strategic partner,\" a senior executive at Time Warner who is close to Turner told me. \"Gerry is a sole practitioner. He keeps things to himself. Ted was not in the loop. Yet Ted did not hesitate to endorse the deal.\" It was, after all, a growth strategy. Nor, according to an AOL strategist who was a party to the negotiations, was Turner's future role even a minor part of these discussions. What was talked about much more, he continued, was what a great fit CNN and AOL would be. \"You can AOL-ize CNN and do cross-promotions,\" the executives said enthusiastically. CNN, in fact, was desperately in need of promotion, for its ratings had plunged and its promotion budget had been cut.\n\nTurner would own four per cent (now just over three and a half per cent) of the new company and remain on the board, and he had won a vice-chairman title. But, while executives at the two companies respected Turner's many successes and his \"vision,\" they also found him unfathomable. One senior AOL executive who was working with Turner for the first time says, \"In meetings I've been in with him, he just sits there and in a piercing voice-louder than you would expect someone to talk-he interrupts or conveys a sense of 'Hurry up! Why am I here?' He gives off a feeling that he's in a rush, even if he's not doing anything.\"\n\nOver the next several months, as the two companies tried to get their executives working together and achieve the synergies they had touted, Turner was in Atlanta or New York no more than four or five days a month. He was not involved in budget details, as Terry McGuirk was, and soon McGuirk, an original Turner loyalist, signalled that he \"wanted out from under Ted,\" a senior member of the AOL Time Warner team explains. McGuirk admired Turner, but, if he was to be held responsible, then he wanted the authority, too.\n\nThere was one other difficulty. In the reorganized company, Steve Case was going to be the chairman and Levin the C.E.O., and the idea was to divide the company into separate spheres, each reporting to one of two presidents. Time Warner's Richard Parsons would oversee movies, music, publishing, legal affairs, and human resources. AOL's Robert Pittman would oversee AOL, cable, the magazines, television (including HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and the WB television network), and business development. \"By a process of elimination, it made sense for Terry McGuirk to report to Bob and for Ted to take a strategic role,\" a senior AOL Time Warner strategist says.\n\nSometimes Turner made light of his diminished role. Lou Dobbs remembers being invited to Turner's Montana ranch for a weekend. While they were fishing, Dobbs, who left CNN in 1999 to start an Internet venture, Space.com-and who returned last week to, among other things, anchor \"Moneyline News Hour\"-said, \"Ted, I outrank you. I'm C.E.O. and chairman.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting,\" Turner said. \"I'm also chairman of the Turner Foundation.\"\n\n\"Ted, that's nonprofit!\"\n\n\"What do you think Space.com is?\" Turner retorted, laughing.\n\nLink copied\n\nDobbs laughs, too, when telling this story, but, like many of Turner's friends, he is angry. \"He has not been treated with the respect due him,\" Dobbs says. Jane Fonda agrees. \"The way it was handled was really shocking,\" she says. \"It makes me mad. How dare they give him a phone call!\" Surely Turner did not feel that he was treated properly when CNN cancelled a pet project of his-a multipart documentary exploring the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He recruited a producer, George Crile, but, soon after Crile started work, Turner told him that he was encountering budget opposition at CNN. They would have to scale the project back to three hours. By October, 2000, it was down to a single hour. \"There's a lot of pressure to make the budgets,\" Turner explained, disappointed. In fact, he is so agitated by the budgeting strictures at CNN that, in December, he told me, \"I am going to produce, myself, ten hours on nuclear proliferation and chemical and biological warfare. I'll give first crack to CNN, and if they don't want it I'll give it to PBS.\" (By March, CNN's founder had given up on CNN documentaries. Together with former associates like Pat Mitchell, who is the president of PBS, and Robert Wussler, who had been a top Turner Broadcasting executive, he plans to team up with Bill Moyers for a series of PBS documentaries on world issues; the Turner Foundation will provide half the financing. \"Over the next few years I would hope we would do one hundred hours,\" Wussler says.)\n\nWhen he cut the Crile project from three hours to one, Tom Johnson says, \"Ted wasn't happy. I don't think he's happy with me. Ted knows I'm in a new world today.\" Turner was reminded of this \"new world\" when he invited me to sit in on a CNN executive-committee meeting on December 19th, and the invitation was rescinded. \"He invited you to a meeting that is not his meeting,\" an AOL Time Warner executive explained.\n\nThen, this past January, although Turner calls CNN \"the most profitable news operation in the world\"-it earned three hundred million dollars the previous year-its staff, of more than four thousand, was reduced by nearly ten per cent. Those who are gone include such Turner stalwarts as Elsa Klensch, Barbara Pyle, Nick Charles, Larry Woods, Gene Randall, and the Atlanta-based Turner Environment Division, with its show \"People Count,\" which Fonda sometimes hosted. On CNN evening programs, talk replaced news reports-often the shouting-head format that CNN inaugurated with \"Crossfire\" and which Fox News and MSNBC had copied and extended. \"Basically, the Fox prime-time schedule is just talk radio,\" Rick Kaplan, the former CNN/U.S. president, says.\n\nTom Johnson, who is worried about the future of CNN, says that Bob Pittman assured him that he and his colleagues in New York believed in CNN's mission. But Pittman's definition of CNN's mission may not match Johnson's or Turner's. Daily journalism is an inherently wasteful process: it involves waiting for calls to be returned, for airlines to fly, keeping forty-two bureaus functioning, chasing stories that don't pan out, and sometimes working for days on a single story. Will stockholders think this productive? As late as December, a longtime Turner executive predicted, \"Ted will protect us.\"\n\nLess than three months later, Turner was unable to protect two longtime lieutenants-Terry McGuirk and Steve Heyer. Turner says McGuirk and Heyer chafed at AOL Time Warner's demand that Turner Broadcasting's \"operating profits\" (EBITDA, which are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) grow by thirty-nine per cent in 2001-which Turner says is nearly double the actual profit-growth average of the company over the past five years. \"They were unhappy mainly that the financial goals they were given were unachievable without really hurting the company,\" Turner says.\n\nAOL Time Warner executives insist that the true profit-growth target for the Turner Broadcasting division is half that, and that Turner's percentage does not reflect significant accounting changes. (Nonsense, senior executives at Turner Broadcasting say, claiming that their operating profits in 2000 were just under a billion dollars and that their company-imposed goal for 2001 is nearly $1.4 billion; the growth target that AOL Time Warner presented to Wall Street for the entire company in 2001 is thirty-one per cent.) Associates say Pittman is disturbed that CNN has lost market share to Fox News and MSNBC; CNN's prime-time ratings for the first quarter of 2001 were down five per cent from last year, while Fox News's climbed by a hundred and twenty-six per cent and MSNBC's by seventeen per cent. Turner is particularly worried about Fox News, which is in fewer homes but has talk-show hosts like the conservative Bill O'Reilly, who is now reaching a larger audience than Larry King, CNN's ratings champion.\n\nTurner says that he is uncomfortable with what he believes are arbitrary budget goals-what he called the company's new preoccupation with \"short-term fluctuations\" in its stock price-saying, \"I never ran the company by the numbers.\" Pittman denies that the company is being run strictly by the numbers. \"I think CNN is one of the great assets in the world,\" he says. \"But it takes a long time to build a franchise based on reliability and trust. They got it. That's something you can't replace overnight. That's the core, the value.\" And, Pittman adds, \"everyone agreed on\" a growth-target number, including, he implies, McGuirk. McGuirk, asked about the growth target, refuses to comment. He does say, \"The numbers are given to us, not negotiated.\"\n\nTed Turner today gets more notice outside his company than in it. When Fidel Castro came to New York last year for a three-day summit meeting at the U.N., he wanted to spend one night having dinner with Turner, who flew in from Montana for the occasion. The dinner stretched past midnight, and Castro was in the middle of a long-winded story when Turner raised his hand and exclaimed, \"Fidel, this story is never going to end, is it? I got to go!\" Castro laughed as Turner exited. Turner was the first Western businessman to have a private audience with Russia's new President, Vladimir Putin, who, Turner remembers, used to drive him when Turner visited St. Petersburg and Putin was a deputy to the city's mayor. \"I learned the value of being nice to everyone,\" Turner says, jokingly. In a trip arranged by George Crile, last May, Turner was also among the few private citizens to visit a nuclear command center outside Moscow. General Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces, cautioned, \"Don't touch any buttons!\" There was a PowerPoint presentation, in English, delineating Russia's various nuclear forces. Turner learned that each of seven thousand warheads could obliterate everything within a one-to-two-mile radius before the radiation and the fires spread. Turner sat mute, Eason Jordan recalls, for an hour and a half, transfixed by what he heard and saw. \"It was the only time I ever saw him speechless,\" Jordan says.\n\nYakovlev and Putin, like Castro, watch CNN. \"The Carter Center has programs in sixty-five different nations,\" Jimmy Carter says. \"We deal with leaders of nations who have a human-rights problem or conflict. . . . We go to those countries, and they quite often do not have a U.S. embassy in them. Invariably, in the offices there will be a TV station tuned to CNN.\" They know about Turner, and they know, Carter adds, that Turner is a true citizen of the world, a man who speaks up for what he believes even when it offends his government. Carter describes Turner as a personal \"hero.\" Kofi Annan sees this in Turner's appeal. \"He and Castro have a similar quality,\" Annan says. \"They are folk heroes of a sort. You can have one hundred heads of state here, and most people will gravitate toward Castro. You can have one hundred media heads here, and people will gravitate toward Ted.\"\n\nIn mid-March, Turner made a two-day visit to Harvard. An evening appearance at the Kennedy School of Government drew a large audience, and he was introduced by Alex S. Jones, the director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, who said, \"Ted Turner changed America.\" Turner jumped up on the low platform, pumped Jones's hand, and started talking, with Jones still at his side. Turner used no notes. He wore a blue corduroy jacket and gray slacks. Perhaps it was the way he jumped up and, in his joltingly loud voice, started talking quickly, or the way he suddenly paused and drawled, \"Ahhhhhhhhhh\"; or perhaps it was the way he seemed to lapse into self-pity when he said, \"I'm just trying to do the best I can,\" or the way he raced from subject to subject, sometimes letting thoughts collide-how he was rejected by Harvard when he applied, and how he'd given Jane Fonda a hundred million dollars, and how, just recently, she bestowed more than twelve million of that sum on Harvard's School of Education for the study of gender and education, and how he wasn't a journalist but had related to the species since he sold newspapers as a boy-perhaps it was these quirks that caused the audience, as often happens when Turner speaks, to giggle. Michael Baumgartner, a first-year graduate student, initially thought Turner sounded drunk. Watching Turner speak is like watching live TV, with the audience wondering what will happen next.\n\nLink copied\n\nBut although at first people seemed to be laughing at Turner, the feeling in the room soon changed. On being told that President Bush earlier that day had abandoned a campaign pledge to establish \"mandatory reduction targets\" for carbon-dioxide emissions by power plants, Turner was momentarily silenced. \"That's heartbreaking news,\" he said finally. \"I mean, I can't take any more bad news. I've lost my job and my wife this year!\" Turner went on to talk about the environment, and about curbing nuclear weapons, and about his commitment to news. When he finished, students clamored to shake his hand.\n\nThat night, Turner was discreet about CNN. Asked about its future, he said, \"Well, I hope it's a bright one.\" But, while Turner thinks CNN has programmed \"too much\" talk, he has no idea how to cure its ratings woes: \"Quite frankly, I'm not sure I have the answers.\" Privately, he is concerned about a general dumbing down that is taking place in the media, putting \"DiSiprio\"-he means Leonardo DiCaprio-\"on the cover of Time . Obviously, it should be on the cover of People or Entertainment Weekly! \"\n\nBy the next morning, the man who confesses to a congenital inability to police a secret was no longer restrained. Turner did not criticize the recent round of cutbacks at CNN, but he did criticize the parent company's growth target. This was impossible to achieve, Turner said, without doing harm to CNN's journalism. \"I always wanted CNN to be the New York Times of the television business,\" he said, a little sadly.\n\nAlthough the AOL Time Warner merger took effect only in January, there have already been some successes. As the largest individual shareholder in the conglomerate, Turner is enthusiastic about a new emphasis on coördination and synergy. Of Gerald Levin's management over the past five years, Turner bluntly says, \"The Time Warner divisions did not coöperate the way they should have. . . . I think he did a pretty marginal job of running the company.\" Now, with roughly forty per cent of Americans using AOL to reach the Internet, AOL is vital in promoting each division of the company. In the eight months ending January 31st, for example, Pittman told Wall Street analysts, AOL had sold eight hundred thousand new subscriptions to Time Inc.'s different magazines. The company is in various businesses, Levin said at a conference earlier this month, but one word united them: \"subscriptions\"-a total of a hundred and thirty million subscribers.\n\nTurner, however, is afraid that when journalistic divisions like CNN shrink corporate executives may try to \"avoid doing stories that are critical of the big companies, like the oil companies and the automobile companies. It's not easy to do stories that are critical of G.E.-you know, nuclear-power-plant stories. When was the last time you saw stories on TV critical of G.E. or DuPont? Better to stay away from the corporations-they're the sponsors. That's the danger.\" Turner, to be sure, does not talk about the embarrassments of his own tenure, including CNN's unceasing coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder case and trial.\n\nAt another of his Harvard appearances-a session in which he was questioned by Jones and several others for an hour and then stayed for an hour more as the six finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting discussed their stories-Turner said, \"I've already been fired, and I probably will be again shortly.\" One of the Shorenstein Fellows rose and condescendingly suggested that Turner might follow the example of Henry Ford, who also left his job but who set up the Ford Foundation, which is \"one of the most influential forces for the framing of issues in the country. You have a life and a future and can use your contacts-\"\n\n\"I am,\" Turner interrupted, and he mentioned his gift to the U.N. Foundation. \"No other individual in the world is giving as much to the poor world as I am. I'm spending fifty million dollars in the United States, mostly on environmental and family-planning causes. Ahhhhhhhh . . . I mean, family planning is under attack. You know, pro-lifers have got control of the White House. Roe v. Wade is hanging on by a thread. A woman's right to choose? They want to take that away. We're fighting global warming.\" He mentioned the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the dues payment to the U.N. \"And let me tell you what else I'm doing. I'm very close to making an announcement of a personal partnership through our foundation with public broadcasting to fund important documentaries that Turner Broadcasting has dropped. . . . And I've been trying desperately to get my network. It won't be NBC, but it will start with an N-NTV. The good news? I'm gonna get my network. The bad news? It's in Russia! I'm gonna try and help freedom of the press. I mean, I am doing plenty, Bubba!\"\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether Turner will own a network in Russia. In early April, he announced a plan to purchase part of the network founded by the Russian press baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky. This pleased independent Russian journalists like Masha Lipman, the deputy editor of the magazine Itogi , who says, \"It will be much more difficult for the Russian authorities to play dirty jokes\" on Turner. But the hard questions, she says, are two: Who will control the journalistic enterprise-Turner or the Russian authorities? And will Turner receive real guarantees of editorial freedom? Turner's longtime colleague Bob Wussler says that Gazprom, the state-dominated monopoly that has asserted control over the TV network, told him and Turner, \"You go do a deal with Gusinsky and come back and we'll do a deal with you.\" And even though President Putin stopped short of offering what Wussler calls \"a ringing endorsement\" of press freedom when Turner asked for it, Wussler feels that \"Putin is a politician and can say just so much. We took it as a good sign.\" Last week, however, Turner was struggling to invent a formula to satisfy Gusinsky, Gazprom, and the journalists themselves. On the surface, the deal is consistent with Turner's world-diplomacy principle-\"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\" But it may also suggest a certain naïveté.\n\nTurner's ability to give his money away has diminished as his principal stock holding-AOL Time Warner-has declined by more than thirty per cent since the merger announcement, reducing his net worth by about two billion dollars. It is possible, he tells me, that he will end his association with the company entirely. He hasn't quite accepted the idea that his business career is largely over, but he believes that his primary mission now is to help save the world, and perhaps himself.\n\n\"For some reason, he has a guilty conscience,\" Jane Fonda told me. \"He went much further than his father thought he would. So what's left? To be a good guy. He knows he will go down in history. He won't go down as a greedy corporate mogul. Although he claims to be an atheist, at the end of every speech he says, 'God bless you.' He wants to get into Heaven.\" Fonda told me of a family outing in 1992 on the occasion of the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. They went to a matinée of a film about Columbus and in the darkened theatre someone screamed out a litany of Columbus's supposed sins. There was a silence, until Turner blurted, \"I never did that!\" Fonda reached over and soothed her husband by patting his knee and said, \"It's O.K., honey. I know you didn't.\" She now says, \"I did that a lot.\" Turner concedes, \"I wish I didn't apologize as much as I do.\"\n\nOver breakfast at the Charles Hotel, in Cambridge, I asked Turner why he felt so burdened. \"It's the position you're in,\" he said. \"Because I was at CNN, because I had commitments, because I did the Goodwill Games, because I was concerned, because I did all those documentaries, I developed a self-imposed sense of responsibility. If Gandhi and Martin Luther King could make the kind of sacrifices with their lives that they did, and that our parents did fighting in World War I and World War II, why couldn't I make sacrifices, too?\" At that, Turner looked up from his hearty chipped-beef-and-biscuit breakfast, in the middle of the hotel dining room, and, as people at nearby tables leaned forward to listen, he performed from memory parts of Thomas Macaulay's \"Horatius\":\n\nLink copied\n\nAnd how can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods. . . .\n\nHaul down the bridge, Sir Consul With all the speed ye may; I, with two more to help me, Will hold the foe in play. In yon straight path a thousand May well be stopped by three. Now who will stand on either hand, And keep the bridge with me?\n\n\"Pretty cool, huh,\" Turner said, grinning; he had, in the longer version that he recited, got almost every word right. \"If Horatius could do it, I can do it. He saved Rome. . . . He stopped the Etruscans.\" His smile widened, and he couldn't resist a final bow, with a loud \"heh-heh-heh.\" Then he leaned over and whispered, as if to a co-conspirator, \"I know a lot . My knowledge is my burden. If I didn't know so much, I could just go through life as a dilettante.\" He stood up and, watched by everyone in the room, walked briskly to the door.♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Lost Tycoon\n\nEarly last year, Ted Turner seemed invincible. He was the largest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, owning around four per cent of the soon-to-be-merged companies; his celebrated name was on the door of a major division, Turner Broadcasting System; and his dimpled chin, gap-toothed smile, and pencil-thin Gable-esque mustache were recognizable everywhere. His life is documented by the framed magazine covers that crowd the walls of his Atlanta office: Turner in 1976, launching the first \"Superstation,\" by transforming a weak local television signal into a robust cable network; Turner in 1977, skippering his boat, Courageous, to victory in the America's Cup; Turner pioneering the purchase of professional sports teams as cheap and reliable programming; Turner inventing the twenty-four-hour Cable News Network; Turner buying Hollywood film libraries to create new cable-television networks; Turner as Time's Man of the Year.\n\nTed Turner's business successes didn't end when, in 1996, Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner. His influence at the world's largest media company was pervasive; he played the role of crazy-uncle-in-the-basement whose large appetite for cost-cutting has to be appeased, and in the process he helped revive the company's stock. But when, in January of 2000, Time Warner and Turner agreed to join with the Internet company America Online, Turner was not invited to participate in the talks about how the merged company would function.\n\nLess than four months later, Ted Turner was fired. The news, Turner says, was delivered during a telephone call from Gerald Levin, the C.E.O. of Time Warner, who told Turner what Turner had often told others: the company was going to reorganize. Turner Broadcasting would no longer report to Turner but, rather, to Robert Pittman, the chief operating officer of AOL. \"You can't report to Pittman, so you have to have a more senior role,\" Levin remembers telling Turner. As Turner recalls, Levin went on to say, \"Sorry, Ted, but you lose your vice-chairman title as well.\" According to Levin, Turner offered to give up his vice-chairmanship in order to keep running the Turner Broadcasting division, which included CNN, TNT, Turner Classic Movies, the TBS Superstation, the Cartoon Network, the New Line Cinema studio, the Atlanta Braves baseball team, the Atlanta Hawks basketball team, the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team, and Time Warner's HBO. \"I didn't fire Ted,\" Levin insists today. \"I said, 'This is the way we need to run the company.'\"\n\nTurner protested, in a series of calls first to Levin, then to Steve Case, the C.E.O. of AOL, who was to be the chairman of the new company, demanding that he not be deprived of supervision of CNN and the other cable networks that he had started. He thought that he would prevail, and in early May-perhaps because he, like Levin, hates confrontation, or perhaps because making speeches has become his accustomed mode of communication and he had now spoken-Turner got on his plane and headed for New Mexico, where he owns a five-hundred-and-eighty-thousand-acre ranch, and where he had invited some friends to join him. Turner is America's largest individual landowner, with nearly two million acres, or the rough equivalent of the land area of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. He owns twenty-two properties, in nine states and Argentina, and he spends about half his time at one or another of them.\n\nTurner didn't see that his travels often slowed decision-making at Turner Broadcasting. Although he entrusted most matters to a deputy, Terence F. McGuirk, he expected to approve major projects himself. AOL and Time Warner executives, however, were impatient with the peripatetic Turner. He is sixty-two, and even his friends wanted him to slow down. Jane Fonda, his former wife, thinks that she knows why he is so restless: \"I say this with all the love in the world. . . . He has been severely, hauntingly traumatized. He always thinks something is about to be pulled out from him. He has no belief in permanency and stability. It's one reason why I'm not with him. Older age is about slowing down and growing vertically, not horizontally. That's not Ted.\"\n\nSomething was \"pulled out\" from Turner while he was in New Mexico, as he learned from a five-page fax that he received there. The fax, a press release issued by AOL Time Warner, announced a new management team for the company, awarding Turner one of two vice-chairmanships and \"the additional title of Senior Advisor.\" The fax did not say that he had lost much of his authority, or that his five-year contract to manage Turner Broadcasting had been abrogated a year early. John Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media and an old friend of Turner's, who was a guest at the ranch, recalls that when the fax arrived \"Ted went white. He was very upset. He thought it was extremely bad behavior for them to do it that way.\" Malone told Turner, \"You can sue, but you won't get your job back. You'll just get money.\"\n\nTurner's bosses tried to defuse the publicity with praise. At a press luncheon for CNN's twentieth anniversary, four weeks after the announcement, Case told reporters, \"Ted Turner has been a hero of mine for twenty-five years, and he and I are basically going to be joined at the hip.\" Turner can be seduced with kind words, with pleas to work for the good of the team, but he wasn't this time. \"'Vice-chairman' is usually a title you give to somebody you can't figure out what else to do with,\" he says. He likened himself to a monarch.\n\nTurner says that last year was one of the most miserable of his life. His marriage to Fonda ended, after eight years, and this, too, was announced in January. In addition, he smashed his foot in a skiing accident; his beloved black Labrador, Chief, contracted coonhound disease and was temporarily paralyzed; his back hurt and he thought that he needed surgery; and two of his grandchildren were diagnosed with Hurler's syndrome, a rare and sometimes lethal enzyme deficiency. Most adults have the support of a spouse and family, friends, and a job; Turner didn't have a spouse, had never had intimate friends, and no longer ran his own company. \"I felt like Job,\" Turner told me, adding, not for the first time, that he had felt \"suicidal.\"\n\nYet Turner has, in the past several years, been commanding more attention outside his company, making a new identity for himself as a philanthropist-\"I want to be Jiminy Cricket for America,\" he has said. In 1997, before it was fashionable for billionaires to make such gifts, he pledged a billion dollars to the United Nations. The Turner Foundation, which he controls, awarded fifty million dollars last year to environmental causes. (Turner is a devoted environmentalist-he can name every species of bird and animal on his ranches-and during the oil embargo of 1973 he sold his Cadillac and switched to more fuel-efficient cars; recently, he exchanged his Ford Taurus for a hybrid electric-and-gas Toyota Prius, which averages about fifty miles a gallon.) Last year, Turner started a foundation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, whose goal is to curb the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and he has pledged two hundred and fifty million dollars over the next five years. In December, to solve a long-running dispute between what the United States owed the United Nations and what Congress was willing to pay, Turner joined Richard C. Holbrooke, then the Ambassador to the U.N., to shape an extraordinary compromise: Turner would contribute the thirty-four-million-dollar difference, and the U.N. would adjust its future dues formula.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner calls himself \"a do-gooder.\" He says so in a loud voice, and it gets louder as he gets excited. Turner is uninhibited, and is usually blissfully unaware of others; for one thing, he is hard of hearing and is too vain to use a hearing aid. \"Half the people alive today are already living in what we would consider intolerable conditions,\" he declares. \"One-sixth don't have access to clean drinking water; one-fifth live on less than a dollar a day; half the women in the world don't have equal rights with men; the forests are shrinking; the temperature's rising, and the oceans are rising, because of the melting of the ice cap.\" He sounds like a billionaire Jeremiah. In a hundred years, he believes, New York will be under water and it will be \"so hot the trees are going to die.\" He continues, \"It will be the biggest catastrophe the world has ever seen-unless we have nuclear war.\" He is outraged that the United States and others don't do more to alleviate these horrors and to combat the defense and foreign policies of George W. Bush. \"The new Administration attempts to make enemies out of the Russians, the North Koreans, and the Chinese to justify the gigantic military buildup it wants to make in peacetime,\" he says. \"The economy of North Korea is smaller than the economy of Detroit!\" And he is disturbed by the world's exploding population; although he has five children, he once declared, \"If I was doing it over again, I wouldn't have had that many, but I can't shoot them now that they're here.\"\n\nTurner's contradictions are as clear as his views. He successfully opposed unionization at his company, yet he rails against élites. He has called himself \"a socialist at heart\" and a fiscal \"conservative.\" Turner speaks out on behalf of the rights of women but refuses to denounce Islamic states that suppress women's rights. He has compared Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Fox network, to Hitler, yet when he is asked if he thinks Saddam Hussein is evil he says, \"I'm not sure that I know enough to be able to answer that question.\" And though he preaches tolerance, he has uttered some intolerant words; for example, on Ash Wednesday, seeing the black smudge on the foreheads of some CNN staff members, he asked them whether they were \"Jesus freaks.\" As he frequently does when he says something unwise, Turner apologized, blithely assuming that the furor would pass. It did. A week later, Turner told me, \"That's the downside of speaking spontaneously.\"\n\nTurner has two offices, in New York and Atlanta, and they seem to capture the odd mixture of his views: in his New York office, which is nearly bare, a bust of Alexander the Great peers from a shelf, while the Atlanta office, which is vast and crammed with trophies and artifacts, features busts of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Gandhi. \"I've gone from a man of war to a man of peace,\" Turner explains. He offers the Turner principle of world diplomacy: \"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\"\n\nDespite Turner's success, people who meet him often think that he is peculiar. They hear his piercing laugh and the long \"Ahhhhhhhhh\"s he utters as he pauses between words or thoughts, which veer off in surprising directions, and they have no other explanation. A former director of Turner Broadcasting's board who counts himself a friend and a fan describes Turner as a fascinating amalgam of opposites: \"He's a mixture of a genius and a jackass. I think Ted could have run for President of the United States-if there were not the jackass side.\"\n\nThe \"jackass side\" of Turner appears because, he himself says, \"I don't have any idea what I'm going to say. I say what comes to my mind.\" Gerald Levin puts this in the best light: \"Ted is by far the most interesting person I've ever met-how he reacts to things. It's as if a child were speaking, without any social inhibitions. You don't say in business, 'I got fired.' He'll just speak out loud what may be going through someone's mind, and he'll say it to everybody. I think that's a beautiful characteristic. He's angelic. The whole world is socially constrained. I love and respect this about Ted, but for other people it may be very difficult.\"\n\nIn November of 1996, for instance, the Friars Foundation honored Turner at a lifetime-achievement black-tie dinner. After he received his award and made a short speech, the lights dimmed, and then, as various entertainers, including the comedian Alan King, prepared to roast him, Turner, who insists on getting to bed early, grabbed Fonda's arm and departed, leaving the crowd gasping and King bellowing, \"Rupert Murdoch was right-you are nuts.\"\n\nOn other occasions, humor redeems the situation. In January of 1999, Turner was invited to address the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin. Eason Jordan, who oversaw international coverage for CNN, had briefed Turner on what he shouldn't say to his audience, made up largely of Germans. Nevertheless, Jordan recalls, the CNN staff was nervous, because Turner had said, \"I'll wing it.\" And he did.\n\n\"You know, you Germans had a bad century,\" Turner declared. \"You were on the wrong side of two wars. You were the losers.\" He continued, \"I know what that's like. When I bought the Atlanta Braves, we couldn't win, either. You guys can turn it around. You can start making the right choices. If the Atlanta Braves could do it, then Germany can do it.\" The audience laughed with Turner, not at him. He left the podium to a standing ovation.\n\nTurner likens himself to Zorba the Greek: \"I lose my self-restraint and . . . just get up and dance sometimes.\" Gail Evans, a senior executive at Turner Broadcasting, says that Turner is always \"winking,\" and she recalls the time he asked her to take the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau to lunch: \"Go buy Mr. Cousteau a tuna-fish sandwich!\" Today, associates are not laughing; they speak of Turner in the past tense, offering epitaphs. \"He's the last of the revolutionary and creative minds in our business,\" CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, who joined the company in 1983, says. \"The idea of twenty-four-hour news and global news is his creation. That's changed the world. It's changed people's relations with their governments. It's meant that governments can no longer crack down with impunity on protests. And Ted's business also had a human face and a moral face and a social face. It wasn't just about making money and building an empire.\" She adds, sadly, \"He's been shunted aside.\"\n\nEven Turner talks about himself in a retrospective cadence: \"My business side is coming to a close. It's time for me to move on, anyway.\" Last May, after AOL and Time Warner announced the new management structure, Robert Pittman tried to debunk press speculation that Turner was unhappy, saying, \"I think Ted's going to have more influence than he had before.\" Now Pittman, who was born in Mississippi and has spent weekends hunting with Turner, says, \"For me, Ted has a very big role. I don't make major decisions about Turner Broadcasting without talking to Ted.\" This is not what Turner thinks. \"They tell me I have moral authority, and that's great,\" he says. He looks down at his tie, which is decorated with orange bison, and goes on to say, wistfully, \"I'm very busy. Over the last three to four years, I've created another life for myself, and even if they had offered me the chairmanship of the company I probably wouldn't have taken it. It would require all my time, and I'd have to move to New York and I don't want that. I've got this other stuff that I think is in many ways more important.\"\n\nIn March, Turner's business influence was further diminished when the parent company announced that his top lieutenants at Turner Broadcasting-Terence McGuirk, the chairman and C.E.O., and Steven J. Heyer, the president-would be replaced by Jamie Kellner, the chief executive and founder of the WB broadcast network. To achieve more of the company's much touted synergies, Turner Broadcasting would be folded into a combined broadcast-and-cable-television division, which would be run by Kellner; Kellner would move to Atlanta from Hollywood. In a press release, Turner applauded Kellner's promotion. He was pleased that the separate fiefdoms in his old company and Time Warner would be joined-he blames Levin for wanting \"to keep everybody weak, so he could be stronger\"-but sorry that AOL Time Warner was practicing what he thinks of as management by the numbers.\n\nSince Turner's dismissal, his offices, at the CNN Center, in Atlanta, and at Time Warner's headquarters, at 75 Rockefeller Plaza, have been largely idle. Friends notice that his shoulders slope more, that his hair has turned white, that his hearing is worse, that he complains about pain in his back and his foot, that he is self-conscious about his age. His energy level has decreased, along with his business authority. He is a member of the company's official executive committee, but it meets just once a month; the core corporate executive committee meets for lunch every Monday without him.\n\nLink copied\n\nStill, the needy side of Turner compels him to want to please. Before an Advertising Council dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria last November in honor of Turner and Levin, Turner stood awkwardly beside Levin in a receiving line. As they turned to enter the ballroom, Turner pointed to me and told Levin that I was writing about him. Levin said he knew, and that prompted Turner to reassure him: \"I checked first with corporate communications. I would not have done this unless I had approval.\" Such behavior does not surprise Jane Fonda. Turner is insecure, she says, noting that the man who thinks of himself as Rhett Butler is really the more vulnerable character in his favorite movie: \"He loves 'Gone with the Wind' for lots of reasons, and one of them is that he identifies with Scarlett O'Hara.\"\n\nRick Kaplan, who was fired as president of CNN/U.S. last September, recalls being taken to lunch by Turner at a Southern-kitchen restaurant, where \"you thought you were walking in with Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium.\" For the first time, Kaplan noticed, Turner talked mostly about the past: \"Whenever I had spent any time with him, he'd always talk about the future. All of a sudden, gone from his conversation were dreams for the future. And he was supposed to be there to make me feel better. Instead, I left feeling worse for him. I spent more time telling him positive, uplifting things, telling him the truth-that people revere him and it doesn't matter what his title is and it doesn't matter what anyone says his responsibilities are. Ted could sell all his stock, divest himself of every nickel he's got, and if he walked into the CNN newsroom the place would stand at attention.\"\n\nPerhaps, but in the new world of AOL Time Warner it is probably not premature to write Ted Turner's business obituary.\n\nThe first word that Robert Edward Turner III uttered was not \"mama\" or \"dada\" but \"pretty.\" It was an odd choice, since he also remembers that, growing up in the shadow of the Second World War, he yearned first to be a fighter pilot with the R.A.F., and then to conquer the world, like his first hero, Alexander the Great. Turner was born in 1938 in Cincinnati; a sister, Mary Jane, was born three years later. His father, Robert Edward (Ed) Turner, Jr., ran a successful outdoor-advertising company. Ted's mother was a dutiful wife, who tried to obey her husband's wishes. Ed Turner was a charming, gifted salesman who was on the road or at work far more than he was at home. He was propelled by the memory of his own father, a cotton farmer in Mississippi, who lost his farm in the Depression and, refusing to declare bankruptcy, became a sharecropper instead. Often, Ed Turner would warn his son that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman were Communists and that the Communists would take over America and execute anyone with more than fifty dollars in his pocket. For years, Ted never carried around more than forty-nine dollars.\n\nTed was obstreperous. He pulled ornaments off the Christmas tree, and smeared mud on a neighbor's sheets that were hanging out to dry. His father instructed him to read two books each week, and to eat every vegetable on his plate. Ed was often drunk, and would fly into a rage when Ted disobeyed; he frequently beat him, sometimes with a wire coat hanger. He would untwist it until it was straight, like a whip, and then hit his son, exclaiming, \"This hurts me more than it does you.\" When this didn't seem to tame Ted, he reversed the punishment, pulling down his pants, lying down, and ordering his son to administer the lashings. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Ted obeyed. \"It was the most painful thing I ever did in my entire life,\" he recalls, giving his father credit for understanding that \"that would be a more effective punishment than him beating me.\"\n\nApparently, it was not effective enough; when Ed Turner joined the Navy, during the Second World War, and was assigned to the Gulf Coast, the family joined him-except for young Ted, who stayed with his grandmother and was eventually sent to boarding school in Cincinnati. Ted was miserable; he was impossible to control, and was suspended. When he was about ten, the family moved to Savannah, Georgia. Intent on teaching his son obedience, Ed Turner became more formal, no longer hugging him but greeting him with a handshake. He sent Ted off to the Georgia Military Academy, outside Atlanta, and then to the military program at the McCallie School, in Chattanooga.\n\nTed read non-stop, committing poems and military history to memory, but he hated boarding school. \"I was hurt,\" he told me. \"I didn't want to go off so young. It was like a prison. You couldn't leave the campus. There was a bell when you got out of bed in the morning and a bell to go to meals, and a bell to go to bed at night.\" And, he added, \"there were no parents there-no mom, no dad.\" Yet Turner defends and even romanticizes his harsh father, saying that he deliberately instilled insecurity: \"He thought that people who were insecure worked harder, and I think that's probably true. I don't think I ever met a superachiever who wasn't insecure to some degree. A superachiever is somebody that's never satisfied.\"\n\nBy the time he was a teen-ager, Ted knew that he did not want to join his father's business. He was religious, and he decided that he was going to be a missionary. Then his sister became ill. He was fifteen when Mary Jane, who was twelve, contracted systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's tissue. She was racked with pain and constantly vomiting, and her screams filled the house. Ted regularly came home and held her hand, trying to comfort her. He prayed for her recovery; she prayed to die. After years of misery, she succumbed. Ted lost his faith. \"I was taught that God was love and God was powerful,\" he says, \"and I couldn't understand how someone so innocent should be made or allowed to suffer so.\"\n\nThe experience transformed Turner. \"I decided I wanted to be a success,\" he says. Though he wasn't much of an athlete, he became a good boxer; the same tenacity that enabled him to resist his father helped him in boxing, because, he recalls, \"I could take punishment.\" To impress his father, he took up debating and excelled at it; as a senior, he won the state high-school debating championship. He also became an accomplished sailor.\n\nEd Turner was constantly giving his son instructions: where he should work during the summers, whom he should date, how he had to save to pay his college tuition. When Ted was at home, his father even charged him room and board. Expecting his son to attend Harvard, he was displeased when a rejection letter arrived. Ted was accepted at Brown, and that mollified his father, but not for long. According to a detailed account of Ted's Brown years in Robert and Gerald Jay Goldberg's \"Citizen Turner,\" he wasn't much of a student. He gambled. He got into noisy arguments, defending the South, defending war as a means of ridding the planet of the weak, defending nationalism. He delighted in irritating liberal sensibilities. He kept a rifle in his room, and sometimes poked it out the dormitory window and fired off a round or two. He partied and drank too much. He talked about dates as if he were describing military conquests. But Ted could be charming and funny, and, as is still the case, he was hard to miss. He joined the Brown sailing team, and was named the best freshman sailor in New England.\n\nHis father, who had divorced Ted's mother in 1957 and was now remarried, tried, in his son's word, to \"micromanage\" his life, to treat college as preparation for a business career. When Ted chose to major in classics, his father wrote angrily:\n\nI am appalled, even horrified, that you have adopted Classics as a Major. As a matter of fact, I almost puked on the way home today. . . . I am a practical man, and for the life of me I cannot possibly understand why you should wish to speak Greek. With whom will you communicate in Greek? I have read, in recent years, the deliberations of Plato and Aristotle, and was interested to learn that the old bastards had minds which worked very similarly to the way our minds work today. I was amazed that they had so much time for deliberating and thinking and was interested in the kind of civilization that would permit such useless deliberation. . . . I suppose everybody has to be a snob of some sort, and I suppose you will feel that you are distinguishing yourself from the herd by becoming a Classical snob. I can see you drifting into a bar, belting down a few, turning around to a guy on the stool next to you-a contemporary billboard baron from Podunk, Iowa-and saying, \"Well, what do you think about old Leonidas?\" . . . It isn't really important what I think. It's important what you wish to do with the rest of your life. I just wish I could feel that the influence of those odd-ball professors and the ivory towers were developing you into the kind of man we can both be proud of. . . . I think you are rapidly becoming a jackass, and the sooner you get out of that filthy atmosphere, the better it will suit me.\n\nLink copied\n\nAgitated by the letter, Ted brought it to the Brown student newspaper, the Daily Herald , and, as Porter Bibb says in his biography \"Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy As It Looks,\" the paper published it anonymously.\n\nIn his junior year, Ted was expelled for smuggling a coed into his room. In fact, it was just the last straw, and, if Ed Turner was unhappy with his son's behavior, he was glad to have him come home and enter the billboard business. Despite their feuds, Ted now rarely questioned that he would work for his father. \"I liked the advertising business,\" he said. Father and son were similar in many ways. Both were persuasive and headstrong. Both viewed seduction as a game of conquest. Both were self-centered. Both were political conservatives. Both liked whiskey. Both battled moments of depression. And both had unsuccessful marriages.\n\nIn 1960, after a brief stint in the Coast Guard, Ted married Julia (Judy) Gale Nye, the daughter of a prominent sailor from Chicago, and they moved to Macon. A year later, when she gave birth to Laura Lee, Ted, intent on winning the America's Cup, was off sailing. Marriage did not stop him from carousing, and he often returned home late at night, as if in a Playboy cartoon, with lipstick on his collar and alcohol on his breath. Two years after they were married, Judy filed for divorce. Then she discovered that she was pregnant again, and the couple reconciled. In May of 1963, Robert Edward Turner IV was born. Ted soon returned to his earlier habits, and finally, after a sailing competition in which he rammed his wife's boat in order to win, Judy decided that the marriage was finished.\n\nTurner was a Barry Goldwater supporter, and he met his second wife, Jane Smith, who was a stewardess based in Atlanta, at a campaign rally. They married in June of 1964, and had three children in short order-Rhett, Beauregard, and Jennie. In 1967, Ted also got custody of the two children from his first marriage. The Turners lived in Atlanta, and Ted was not much better as a father than he was as a husband. He was \"a dictator,\" Laura, who is now close to her father, recalls. Because of the sailing season, he was rarely home for Christmas, and because of work the family took few vacations together. In the summer, because Turner refused to install air-conditioning, the family baked. But, Ted says, recalling his own father, \"I treated my children entirely differently than he did. I let them make a lot of their decisions for themselves.\" Yet he had sudden mood changes, and his temper frightened the children. They were expected to be in bed by 8 P . M . and at breakfast before eight. Good manners were required at the table. Television was limited. If they wanted soda or candy on the weekend, they collected empty bottles to earn the money.\n\nWhile Ted Turner concentrated on mastering the outdoor-advertising business, his father was trying to escape depression; he drank, smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, and took a huge assortment of pills. In 1961, Ed Turner had sought treatment, and he spent a summer at the Silver Hill psychiatric hospital, in New Canaan, Connecticut. A year after he left Silver Hill, Ed Turner made the boldest business decision of his career, paying four million dollars for the Atlanta, Richmond, and Roanoke divisions of General Outdoor Advertising. Instantly, Turner Advertising was the foremost outdoor-advertising company in the South.\n\nTed was convinced that they had scored a coup. His father, though, was strangely morose, worrying that he lacked the resources to absorb such a large company. He returned to Silver Hill, and from there placed a panicky call to a friend in the outdoor-advertising business and pressed him to buy the new divisions for the amount they had cost him. The friend, not wanting to take advantage, threw in a fifty-thousand-dollar bonus. Ed Turner still could not shake his depression. \"I don't want to hurt anybody. I just feel like I've lost my guts,\" he wrote to his wife. On March 5, 1963, Ed Turner had breakfast with his wife, went upstairs, placed a .38-calibre silver pistol in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. He was fifty-three.\n\nHis son later told Christian Williams, who wrote an early biography of him, that he and his father \"had terrible, terrible fights. It was after one of those fights-we disagreed about how the business should be run-that he blew his brains out.\" The message was clear: Ed Turner abandoned his dreams of business glory because he felt inadequate, and because his son wasn't up to the task, either. The son, who was twenty-four, had to face another message: perhaps he was responsible. For all that, Ted Turner says that he lost his \"best friend.\"\n\nIn the weeks and months after his father's suicide, Turner was distraught yet surprisingly focussed. He told his father's advisers and bankers that Ed Turner had not known what he was doing when he resold the company divisions he had just bought; that he, Ted, would sue if necessary to reclaim them; and that, in any case, he was prepared to run the entire enterprise. His ferocity and his mastery of the numbers were impressive. The bankers came through with the loans, and his father's friend sold back the divisions he had bought.\n\nSoon after that, Turner began to dream of going beyond the billboard business, of building a media empire. His first venture came five years after his father's suicide, in 1968, when he bought a Chattanooga radio station, WAPO. Within a year, he had also acquired radio stations in Jacksonville and Charleston. In 1970, he acquired his first television property, Channel 17 in Atlanta, a money-losing UHF station. He borrowed heavily to make the purchase, and the consensus was that he had been outsmarted; although he changed the station's call letters from WJRJ to WTCG, it looked as if he would lose everything. \"Working in UHF television at that time was like being in the French Foreign Legion,\" recalls Terry McGuirk, who was hired by Turner the summer after his junior year at Middlebury College, and who became Turner's protégé. The staff consisted of about thirty employees; for many, the pay was thirty dollars a week and all you could eat. The finances became even more dire when Turner acquired a second TV station, in Charlotte. McGuirk, who was dispatched to sell ads, says that the new station was costing Turner fifty thousand dollars a month. And a good deal of the time Turner was away sailing, a hobby that commanded nearly as much of his attention as business did. But he managed to motivate his tiny staff, just as he did his sailing crew.\n\nTurner charmed and wheedled to get ads, and he introduced inexpensive programming. News was alien to the man who would become identified with CNN-too negative, Turner complained-and at first it was aired only in the early-morning hours. Turner programmed \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and Three Stooges movies and every sports event he could find. Although profits were slim, he became obsessed with broadcasting. He wanted a national network, and, since he couldn't afford a broadcast network (there were none for sale, anyway), he discovered a way to get one on the cheap. In 1975, Gerald Levin, of Home Box Office, which was then a regional cable service, owned by Time Inc., that offered movies to subscribers, decided that he could transform HBO into a national pay-TV network by distributing it over the newly launched RCA satellite: all he had to do was get cable operators to invest a hundred thousand dollars in a thirty-foot dish. At the time, broadcast-TV stations like Turner's Channel 17 relied on microwave signals that bounced off transmission towers. Turner, however, had a tower that was twice the height of most other such towers, and his station already reached beyond its broadcast range, of forty miles, to five states. But a network of towers was expensive, and the signals were impeded by tall buildings and deteriorated over long distances.\n\nClockwise from top right: Turner with his first wife, Judy Nye; his second wife, Jane Smith; and his father.\n\nCable had other advantages: unlike broadcasting, which produced revenue solely from advertising, it had monthly subscription charges. But cable in those days had little programming of its own; it had started as a way to improve TV reception, and then became a way to extend television to rural communities that didn't get broadcast signals. Turner saw an opportunity. With satellites, as HBO had demonstrated, signals could be sent across the nation, and so Channel 17 could become a cable network. He renamed the new network TBS-Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nTurner was taking not only a huge business risk-he borrowed heavily-but a political risk, too, since he needed approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The broadcast networks and the local TV stations were implacably opposed. They were joined by the Hollywood studios, which complained that Turner would be paying a local price for their movies and exhibiting them nationally, and by professional sports teams, which said that Turner was stealing their product.\n\nTurner and others in the cable industry saw the broadcast networks and their allies as a cartel that had induced the government to impose regulations crippling cable's ability to compete. Cable conventions at that time were like revival meetings, with speaker after speaker fervently denouncing this satan. As a master salesman, Turner knew that Congress had long been concerned about the pervasive power of Hollywood and the three big New York-based broadcast networks, and he assured congressional leaders that he, a broadcaster, was trying to help the nascent cable industry provide consumers with more choices-and better choices, too, since his station would not, he vowed, program violent, sexually explicit movies, like Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver.\" Of course, viewers would not be receiving first-class alternative fare, since Turner was offering movies and sports in the evening and \"Lassie,\" \"The Munsters,\" and \"The Flintstones,\" among other programs, during the day. Nevertheless, the F.C.C. allowed tiny Channel 17 to become the Superstation, an overnight rival to the networks.\n\nCable was starved for programming, and TBS and HBO became its building blocks. To insure continuous baseball coverage that could not be taken off his Superstation, Turner, in 1976, bought the Atlanta Braves; although he paid a bargain price of ten million dollars, he went into debt to do it. He attended most Braves home games: he ran out onto the field to lead the fans in \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\"; sitting behind the Braves dugout, he'd spit Red Man tobacco juice into a cup and swill beer, in hot weather peeling off his shirt; when a Brave hit a home run, he'd jump over the railing and rush to the plate to greet him; he played cards with his players and insisted that they call him Ted. Ralph Roberts, the founder of Comcast Communications, which is now the nation's third-largest cable company, says of TBS, \"We thought it was the greatest thing in the world.\" Roberts was charmed by Turner; others were not. Turner would drop to the floor, histrionically, to beg for business; once, telling a roomful of Southern ladies how to woo advertisers, he explained, \"My daddy said, 'If advertisers want a blow job, you get down on your knees.' \"\n\nHe became Captain Outrageous. Celebrating his victory in the 1977 America's Cup, he swigged almost a whole bottle of aquavit that had been given to him by the Swedish team, and then, drinking champagne, pulled his shirt up to his neck and yelled at some nearby women, \"Show me your tits!\" Earlier that same year, his second as a team owner, the baseball commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, suspended him for the season, accusing him of tampering when he tried to sign a player who was under contract to another team.\n\nTurner tales became legendary. While racing in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1978, Turner coaxed the French-born Frédérique D'arragon-then, as now, a girlfriend-to wait until their boat came to the reviewing stand and then jump naked into the water. Jimmy Carter remembers that when he became President, in 1977, he invited his fellow-Georgian to state dinners. \"He was very raucous,\" Carter said. \"He was loud, and he interrupted sedate proceedings.\" Carter was amused by Turner. Dick Cavett, on the other hand, was not. During a taping of his television show, Cavett pressed him: \"You are a colorful, boisterous, sometimes inebriated playboy type. Maybe it's an act or it's created by the press, but that is your image. You wouldn't deny that, would you?\"\n\n\"I have heard that you are a little twinkle-toed TV announcer,\" Turner responded. \"Would you deny that?\"\n\nBy the late seventies, Turner was rich, and although he still behaved in unconventional ways, he had become more serious. He had great respect for Jimmy Carter, and no doubt Carter's more liberal views affected Turner's own politics. He began to liken himself to \"an ambassador for good will.\" He saw himself as a rabbit-\"a rabbit that's small and fast. All my big competitors were like a pack of wolves, and they were all chasing me, but I was fast enough to be out in front of them.\" The emblem of the rabbit was Turner's brand-new Cable News Network.\n\nReese Schonfeld, a creative and prickly executive, had discussed the cable-news-channel idea with Turner in 1978, and he served as CNN's first president. Turner, who was generous with his money but cheap in sharing credit with Schonfeld, told cable operators that CNN would do for the cable industry what Edward R. Murrow and Huntley-Brinkley had done for network news. CNN would make news the star, not overpaid anchors, and it would not be clotted with ads. Schonfeld travelled the country to sign up cable operators. And at most cable conventions there was Ted Turner, to make a speech and inspire his cable army.\n\nThe new cable network, based in Atlanta, made its official début on June 1, 1980, with three military bands striking up music and a nervous Ted Turner standing at a lectern in a blue blazer. Sporting Elvis sideburns, he began by reciting \"a little poem that was written by Ed Kessler,\" and that reflected CNN's mission: \"To act upon one's convictions while others wait, to create a positive force in a world where cynics abound, to provide information to people when it wasn't available before.\" A band played \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and when it ended Turner whooped \"Awww-riiight!\" and CNN went live.\n\nCNN's production values were initially amateurish-\"video wallpaper,\" or \"talking heads,\" network news executives sneered-and ratings were poor. Most of the work of building a staff, imposing news values, and winning clearance from local cable operators was taken on by Schonfeld. But Turner was the galvanizer, the risk-taker. He practically lived in his office, hurrying through the newsroom and rarely spending more than thirty seconds with anyone. Nick Charles, a sports reporter who was one of the first people to be hired at CNN, recalls that most of the staff worked six or seven days a week and relied on portable toilets outside, and that employees would show up in the morning and see Ted, wearing a robe or wrapped in a towel, wandering out of his office, where he slept on a Murphy bed, to retrieve coffee from the newsroom. Once, Steve Heyer remembers, he walked into Turner's office and the great man was sitting at his desk stark naked. \"Don't get up!\" someone exclaimed. Nick Charles recalls, \"He was much more than a cheerleader. He was the kind of guy you'd want to run through a wall for.\"\n\nAt first, many CNN employees were dubious. Daniel Schorr, a former CBS correspondent, who was hired early on, was worried every time he heard Turner extoll the importance of good news, as if what he wanted were more happy news. Worry spread when, in 1982, Turner, frustrated by Schonfeld's close-to-the-vest management style and ownerlike ego, abruptly fired him. Lou Dobbs, another CNN pioneer, who was a business-news anchor, remembered Turner as a drunken sailor and thought that he might not be \"the right fellow to lead the effort.\" Dobbs was afraid that Turner was more an \"eccentric\" than a \"visionary\"-until he got to know him. \"He is a natural-born leader,\" Dobbs says. \"I once asked him his definition of a leader. He said, 'A leader has the ability to create infectious enthusiasm.' \"\n\nClockwise from top left: Turner with Jane Fonda; at his ranch; and with Frédérique D'arragon.\n\nCNN started as an all-day, mostly live, and mostly domestic news service. But it strayed to cover Cuba's 1981 May Day parade and a speech by Fidel Castro, and that led to an invitation for Turner to visit the island. Turner, who had never been to a Communist country, and whose politics continued to soften, was curious about it, and the next year he accepted the invitation. For the better part of four days, the Cuban Communist and the Southern conservative hung out, smoking cigars, attending a baseball game, duck hunting, visiting schools, discussing politics, and night-clubbing. To an associate, Turner said, \"Fidel ain't a Communist. He's a dictator, just like me.\" He learned that Castro watched CNN's signal from southern Florida; ever the salesman, he persuaded Castro to tape a promotional spot. Castro, in turn, urged Turner to take his news service worldwide. \"Ted came back fired up,\" Eason Jordan remembers. International news quickly expanded-CNN sent its first signal to Asia in late 1982 and to Europe in 1985. Jordan was twenty-eight when he started running CNN's foreign-news coverage.\n\nIn the beginning, the broadcast networks refused to include CNN in their pooled coverage of White House events. Turner filed a federal lawsuit in Atlanta against the \"cartel\" and the Reagan Administration, claiming violations of the antitrust laws and of CNN's rights under the First Amendment. To build support for CNN in Congress, Turner spent thirteen thousand dollars to install a satellite dish for the House and cabled the office of each member of Congress. Because CNN had twenty-four hours of news to fill, a congressman had a much better chance of being seen there. Ted Turner would win the battle for public support; more important, in a landmark ruling in the spring of 1982, the Atlanta court declared in CNN's favor, and by the mid-eighties CNN's triumph was apparent.\n\nOne reason for Turner's success-with CNN, with the Superstation, with buying sports teams to supply cable programming-is identified by Bob Wright, the president and C.E.O. of NBC. \"He sees the obvious before most people do,\" Wright says. \"We all look at the same picture, but Ted sees what you don't see. And after he sees it, it becomes obvious to everyone.\" As the networks shrank their overseas bureaus, CNN expanded. It invested in \"flyaway\" portable satellite dishes, costing about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars each, that could be carried in a suitcase and used anywhere in the world to \"uplink\" to a satellite. Turner wanted to grow bigger still. Although Turner Broadcasting had a mere two hundred and eighty-two million dollars in revenue in 1984, and the New York banks spurned his request for credit, in 1985 Turner got junk-bond financing that enabled him to make a $5.4-billion offer for a broadcast network: CBS.\n\nKnowing that he was an underdog, Turner sought political support from Senator Jesse Helms, of North Carolina. Helms had mounted a campaign against CBS's \"liberal bias,\" and he encouraged Turner to meet with a group called Fairness in Media, which had sent letters to a million conservatives begging them to buy CBS stock and \"become Dan Rather's boss.\" Up North, many in the media expressed horror at the prospect of Turner, whom they regarded as an unsophisticated Southerner-a redneck-owning \"the Tiffany network.\" Thomas Wyman, who was the C.E.O. of CBS, questioned Turner's moral fitness to run a network and accused him of being in bed with ideological groups, although he didn't name any. Wyman and CBS, hoping to block Turner, welcomed the \"white knight\" financing of Laurence Tisch, of the Loews Corporation, and Tisch stealthily gained control of CBS.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, however, Turner was not the provincial portrayed by CBS. As he sought to build CNN overseas, he became much more of an internationalist; he was more concerned with saving the environment, eradicating poverty, and ending the Cold War. He met and became friends with Jacques Cousteau, the primatologist Jane Goodall, the civil-rights leader Andrew Young, and the environmentalist Russell Peterson. \"I was hanging around with people who cared about the future of the planet, both of the human race and of the environment,\" he says. \"And they had an impact on me.\" Although he had once been a smoker, he now refused to hire anyone who smoked. \"I figured any young person who's dumb enough to smoke is too dumb to work at CNN or TBS,\" he says. In 1985, he established the Better World Society, whose purpose was to subsidize documentaries on the dangers of environmental pollution, nuclear weapons, and the population explosion. He also began to proselytize for an end to the Cold War. After the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics, following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union withdrew from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, Turner financed and launched the Goodwill Games to foster athletic competition between the United States and the U.S.S.R. During this time, Turner even thought of running for President.\n\nBut to those who didn't know him-and even to some members of his board, who did-Turner was still often seen as Captain Outrageous. They were tired of hearing that he was going to own a network or a Hollywood studio, that he was going to make movies like \"Gone with the Wind.\" So when, in August of 1985, Turner, without fully consulting his board, bought, for a billion and a half dollars, the M-G-M film studio, its Culver City lot, and its library of more than thirty-five hundred motion pictures the consensus was that he had overpaid. The financing for his impulsive decision was arranged by Drexel Burnham's junk-bond king, Michael Milken, who was representing both Turner and the owner of M-G-M, Kirk Kerkorian. Milken reduced the amount of cash Turner needed by persuading Kerkorian to accept stock in Turner Broadcasting. The difficulty was that Turner found himself with two billion dollars' worth of debt; within three months, he was forced to sell the studio and other parts of M-G-M back to Kerkorian, for three hundred million dollars.\n\nHe kept the film library, however, and he brilliantly exploited this asset. The movies became a source of cheap television programming, and Turner created new cable networks-such as TNT (Turner Network Television), launched in 1988, and TCM (Turner Classic Movies), in 1994-to showcase them. Looking back, he is pleased with himself for having done this \"right under the networks' noses\" and for having managed to grow \"from one-thousandth the size of the networks to two and a half times bigger.\" He says, \"They laughed at me when I started with CBS. They laughed at me when I started CNN. They laughed at me when I bought the Braves. They laughed at me when I bought the Hawks. They laughed at me when I bought M-G-M. I spent a lot of time thinking, and I did not fear, because of my classical background. When Alexander the Great took control when his dad died, he was twenty years old. He took the Macedonian Army, which was the best army in the world at the time, and conquered Greece, got the Greeks to all join with him, and then marched across the Hellespont and invaded Asia. They didn't even know where the world ended at that time. And he was dead at thirty-three, thirteen years later. He kept marching. He hardly ever stopped. And he never lost a battle.\"\n\nTurner did lose battles, even if they were within the company. Kerkorian, it was revealed, had a stipulation that if Turner did not reduce his debt within six months he would have to pay Kerkorian in TBS stock, and Turner worried that Kerkorian could soon gain control of his company. On top of this, companies like Rupert Murdoch's were turning a raptor's eye on the debt-ridden Turner empire. To avoid losing everything, Turner, in 1987, looked to a consortium of thirty-one cable companies-in particular, T.C.I. and Time Inc.'s cable subsidiary-for a bailout. In return for more than five hundred million dollars in cash, Turner ceded more than one-third ownership to them; he also granted the cable executives seven of fifteen board seats and an effective veto over any expenditure exceeding two million dollars. \"In hindsight, you could say that Ted lost his company,\" Terry McGuirk says. \"But, at the time, it was in many ways Nirvana, because Ted partnered with his best customers.\" Turner, however, wanted to expand, and his new partners did not. They wanted to protect Turner's programming assets for the cable industry and keep them away from broadcast rivals. Or they wanted the assets for themselves.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner had watched as, in 1985 and 1986, Murdoch formed the Fox network, and CBS, NBC, and ABC got new owners. Increasingly frustrated, he began to spend even more time away from Atlanta. Whenever he wanted to do something bold-buy a studio or a network, for example-he confronted a veto from his board. Decisions about acquisitions were made by committee. One of the few acquisitions that the board approved, in 1991, and only after Turner wore board members down, was of Hanna-Barbera, whose animation library included more than a third of all the animated cartoons ever made in this country; with this library, Turner was able to create the now thriving Cartoon Network.\n\nWhen it came to programming decisions, Turner remained in charge. Brad Siegel, the president of Turner's Entertainment Networks, remembers that when, in 1993, he was hired to run TNT Turner involved himself in such questions as what programs provided the proper lead-ins for 8 P . M . adult dramas. \"One of the great things about Ted is that he watches everything,\" Siegel says. \"Everything we make on the entertainment side-the pilots, the movies, the specials-Ted watches everything on tape. You always got a call.\" And when the ratings were poor but the program was good-as when TNT aired a \"David Copperfield\" movie-Turner congratulated Siegel.\n\nTurner's most visible success came ten years after CNN went on the air-with its coverage of the Gulf War. Unlike the other networks, CNN made a financial commitment to cover any potential war from ground zero, Baghdad. Eason Jordan figured that the Iraqi communications system would be taken out in any allied air raid, so he recommended that CNN invest in a suitcase version of a satellite phone; this expenditure, of fifty-two thousand dollars, would be added to the extra millions that CNN was committed to spend to cover what might be the first live war. Tom Johnson, a former Los Angeles Times publisher, had taken over as president of CNN on August 1, 1990; the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait came on his second day at work. Johnson recalls going to Turner with various spending plans for war coverage. He asked Turner, \"What am I authorized to spend?\"\n\n\"You spend whatever you think it takes, pal,\" Turner said. Johnson was amazed, especially because, he recalls, \"I'm not even sure he remembered my name.\"\n\nJohnson posted people around the clock in Baghdad and Amman and Saudi Arabia and Israel and the White House and the Pentagon and the State Department. CNN, he says, spent twenty-two million dollars covering the war. CNN got permission from the Iraqi government to circumvent the Al Rashid Hotel switchboard and set up a four-wire telephone transmission from Baghdad to Amman, and then to Atlanta. When the United States destroyed the telephone system in Baghdad, only CNN had a telephone. When the Bush Administration urged the broadcast networks to pull their crews out of Iraq, they complied. Tom Johnson tells how he received calls from President Bush and other government officials, urging him to leave Baghdad, and how vexing this was. When he met with Turner and told him about these calls, and about two bureau chiefs who had been killed when he was at the Los Angeles Times , Turner was unmoved. He told Johnson, \"I will take on myself the responsibility for anybody who is killed. I'll take it off of you if it's on your conscience.\" Johnson adds, \"I, frankly, was about to order them back to Amman. I thought they'd all get killed.\"\n\nNo one got killed. And Turner was acclaimed as a different kind of businessman, one who thought about more than profit margins. When he commissioned a CNN documentary series, of more than twenty hours, on the Cold War, Rick Kaplan says, \"his attitude was, if we break even on 'The Cold War' it would still be an enormous success.\" Turner understood, in a way that many corporate leaders do not, that building a brand can be expensive.\n\nIn the late eighties, Turner's personal life became happier. Jimmy Carter remembers that he was hunting and fishing with Turner at Avalon, Turner's estate in Tallahassee, Florida, when Turner read that Jane Fonda was planning to divorce Tom Hayden, the sixties activist. Turner told Carter that he had always admired Fonda, as an actor and as an outspoken liberal. \"I think I'm going to ask her for a date,\" he said. When he called, Fonda put him off. She was not yet ready to date, she told Turner, although she was soon photographed at St. Bart's cavorting with an Italian soccer player.\n\nTurner's second marriage had ended in 1988, after twenty-four years, three children, and many dalliances. His dating patterns conformed to his travel schedule; he took up with, among others, a Playboy bunny and the female pilot of his private plane. Turner was persistent with Fonda, and finally, in late 1989, they had their first date. It was followed by many others, including an Academy Awards ceremony, a White House dinner, a Kremlin dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev. They went horseback riding at Turner's Montana ranches; later, Turner, with Fonda by his side, would point out a cabin to visitors and announce that this was where they first made love. Both were famous, opinionated, rich, and attractive. Both loved the outdoors. Both had endured difficult childhoods under severe fathers. Neither finished college. And both felt profound guilt after the suicide of a parent; Fonda's mother had slashed her own throat at the age of forty-two. \"She is fiercely focussed and full of idealism and, like all of us, full of insecurities, too. And so is he,\" the former Colorado senator Tim Wirth, who is a friend of both, says. \"She reinforced all the best qualities in him. And she said to me the sweetest thing. She said, 'You know, Ted is the only person who's apologized more than I have.' They are really good, vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe couple held hands on Larry King's CNN program. They kissed in public. Turner brought her to CNN executive meetings and they sent mash notes to each other. She got him to drink less and diet more, to spruce up his wardrobe and buy art for his houses. Turner's mood swings became less pronounced; he yelled less, and he stopped taking lithium, which he had been on for about three years because, he says, \"a quack\" psychiatrist misdiagnosed him as \"manic.\"\n\nTurner and Fonda married in December of 1991 at his Florida estate, where bride and groom wore white and were surrounded by their children; they dined on fresh quail that Fonda had shot herself, candied yams, collard greens, and corn bread. Turner hates being alone, so Fonda moved to Atlanta. For much of the next decade, she was at his side. In Montana, Turner announced that he was getting rid of his cattle and sheep and returning the land to bison, the animals that grazed there two centuries ago. Fonda became an enthusiastic hunter. Gerald Levin, who says that he is \"constitutionally opposed to killing animals,\" remembers how, on a visit to one of Turner's properties, he learned that Fonda had shot a deer and loaded it into a pickup truck. \"I was appalled,\" Levin says. \"It was Bambi in the back of the truck!\"\n\nIn Atlanta, Turner did not live in a grand style. He poked a hole in the roof of the CNN Center building and put in a spiral staircase to connect the office to what has been called a penthouse but is really a seven-hundred-square-foot efficiency apartment, with a cramped bedroom. (One wall of the bedroom is a two-hundred-gallon saltwater fish tank, on the other side of which is the living room.) The most striking features of the apartment are a terrace, largely unused, with sweeping views of downtown (for a long while, Turner says, he \"was the only downtown resident-except homeless people!\"), and a photograph-one of the few on display-of Ed Turner looking up adoringly at his son. Turner had slept in his old office for a decade; this apartment allowed him to walk to work and to order room service from the Omni Hotel. To accommodate Fonda, he converted the bedroom closet into a windowless office for her-\"a storage closet,\" Fonda called it.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I learned a lot from Jane,\" Turner says. Laura Seydel, his eldest daughter, explains that her father only reluctantly celebrated Christmas and, until he married Fonda, did not invest time in planning family gatherings. Soon Fonda and Turner and his five children and their families had reunions twice a year, and swapped Christmas presents, and attended church christenings. Laura and her husband, Rutherford Seydel II, live in Atlanta with three young children and are active in charitable activities; Seydel works as a lawyer for Turner. He and Laura think of Turner as a great man, but he was not always a great family man. After he married Fonda, however, Grandpa Turner was around more.\n\nTurner was surprised but not displeased that Fonda attracted more attention than he did when they travelled. Fonda says that Turner was never jealous of the notice she received. \"He doesn't have that kind of ego,\" she says. \"He put me on a pedestal. He loved my successes.\" Although he is not an introspective or patient man, Turner probably opened up more to Fonda than he ever had to anyone else, male or female. By most accounts, the marriage was a good one, and Turner's friends and family came to adore Fonda. Laura says, \"She's grandma to our kids. She filmed our firstborn.\" Embraced by senior female executives at Turner Broadcasting, she went on three-day all-\"girls\" trips. \"Her influence was profound,\" Jimmy Carter told me. Carter smiled as he talked about Turner. \"Ted has always been very hyper, in that he's constantly having visions of grandiose things. He was very restless . . . always dreaming. Ted told us he was taking sedation to calm himself. . . . When he and Jane got together, Ted became much more relaxed.\"\n\nIn the early nineties, Turner began worrying once more that his company was too small. The networks had persuaded the government to relax the rules that prohibited them from owning and syndicating TV programs, which is where television fortunes are made. Turner didn't own a studio, and he feared that the studios would reserve their best programs for their networks, starving Turner Broadcasting. Nor could he match the resources of NBC, now owned by G.E., in bidding for world rights to televise the Olympics, or ABC, owned by Disney, in bidding for Monday Night Football. Turner Broadcasting got smaller compared with its competitors. The usual edge of an entrepreneur like Turner-the rabbit's advantage-seemed less vital than size.\n\n\"You need to control everything,\" Turner said one day recently in his New York office, his foot up against an empty coffee table. \"You need to be like Rockefeller with Standard Oil. He had the oil fields, and he had the filling stations, and he had the pipelines and the trucks and everything to get the gas to the stations. And they broke him up as a monopoly. You want to control everything. You want to have a hospital and a funeral home, so when the people die in the hospital you move them right over to the funeral home next door. When they're born, you got 'em. When they're sick, you got 'em. When they die, you got 'em.\" He smiled and added, \"The game's over when they break you up. But in the meantime you play to win. And you know you've won when the government stops you.\"\n\nTurner set his sights once more on buying a studio or a TV network, or arranging a business partnership with one. With John Malone, he tried to buy Paramount. When Viacom won that competition, Turner and Malone explored purchasing ABC and then entered what Turner thought were serious negotiations to acquire NBC; again, some of the cable owners on his board opposed him. Turner says that Gerald Levin, of Time Warner (Time Inc. had merged with Warner Communications in 1990), which owned nineteen per cent of Turner's company, used that position to veto the five-billion-dollar purchase. Levin was straightforward; he said that the interests of separate companies often diverge. If Turner wanted a network, so did Levin, who was planning to launch his own network, WB.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to merge with Ted,\" Malone told me. \"No one wanted to turn control over to Ted.\" This was true of Rupert Murdoch, who had once gone skiing with Turner. \"He is one of the most charming people you'd ever meet,\" Turner says. \"He told me he loved CNN the way it was and if we merged with him he wouldn't change a thing.\" Turner, who detests Murdoch, says that he didn't believe him. (Murdoch declined to comment.) There was a brief courtship by Bill Gates, of Microsoft; Gates thought that the power of CNN's brand could be transformed into an instantly successful online-news site. Turner thought that Microsoft's deep pockets could be used to help finance a bid for CBS. But the talks went nowhere. (Not long after this, Microsoft became a partner in MSNBC.) Meanwhile, Time Warner was determined that, if anyone was going to take over CNN and Turner's assets, it was going to be Time Warner.\n\nWhen Turner is agitated, the people close to him try to prevent him from talking to reporters or giving a speech. Around this time, however, he was scheduled to speak at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington. Jane Fonda says that she was aware of the \"fragility\" of the relationship between Turner and Time Warner. \"One false move and it would fall apart. I didn't sleep that night. Ted slept like a baby.\" When Turner rose to speak, he startled the audience by mentioning a story on clitorectomies that CNN had aired. Suddenly, he started comparing the mutilation of women to what Gerald Levin was doing to him. He cried out, \"You talk about barbaric mutilation. Well, I'm in an angry mood. I'm angry at that, too. I'm being clitorized by Time Warner!\"\n\n\"I slid under my seat,\" Fonda says. Levin, more diplomatically, says, \"Ted is Ted. He not only says what he thinks; he gives the most amazing speeches. While I think his analogy is a little stretched, he was peeved at the time. He actually called me up, and we talked about it. It wasn't a problem.\"\n\nIt was a problem. Turner felt fenced in, as he does when he is handed a speech to read or when he's told that he can't do something. \"My inner dream is to go to the place,\" he starts to explain-and suddenly breaks into the old Roy Rogers theme song-\"where the West commences, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses. . . . Don't fence me in.\" Fences loom large in Turner's mind; he hates them, and that is one reason that his landholdings are so vast. \"I'm happiest when I'm on a horse on my ranch,\" he says. At the same time, he can't stand to be alone.\n\nThis much is clear: by 1995, after thirty-two years in business, Turner no longer felt like a nimble rabbit. In the spring and early summer of that year, Terry McGuirk, representing Turner, tried to extricate Turner Broadcasting from Time Warner. \"I spent about six months negotiating an exit from Time Warner and doing a deal with John Malone,\" McGuirk recalls. But, much as Turner admired Malone, he feared placing CNN in the hands of such a committed conservative. He was also concerned about Malone's business partnerships with Murdoch. Turner's own biases clearly infected CNN. It was an international network that slavishly covered the United Nations, from whose vocabulary, by Turner's dictate, the term \"foreign news\" was banished, that aired documentaries on subjects Turner cared about. People at CNN undoubtedly knew what the boss wanted. But CNN was not used to punishing Turner's foes, as Murdoch's newspapers sometimes did to Murdoch's foes. Turner \"never once had me pull a story,\" Tom Johnson says. Nor, says Gail Evans, the CNN executive vice-president in charge of booking guests, did he ever order executives to help a friend. \"In my twenty years here, Ted has never once asked me to book a guest,\" she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerald Levin had concluded that his company was not big enough; he saw CNN as \"the jewel\" that he could link with Time Warner's magazines. Levin also knew that he had to move fast, before Turner was bought by a competitor. After talking it over with only two members of his team-Richard Parsons, the president, and Richard Bressler, the chief financial officer-Levin phoned Turner and asked if he could fly to Montana to discuss an \"important\" matter.\n\nLink copied\n\nThis was in August of 1995, and by then, Turner says, \"I knew I was selling the company. And there was another reason I did it, too. I was a little bit tired.\" He was tired of his cable partners. Whatever differences he had with Levin, however, Turner knew that Levin cared deeply about journalism, for he was a proud defender of his magazines' independence. Turner also knew that a merger would connect Turner Broadcasting to a Hollywood studio, a giant music company, the country's largest magazine-publishing enterprise, and its foremost cable system.\n\nWhen Levin's plane landed that morning, Jane Fonda picked him up. Although Turner had weekend house guests-including his neighbors Meredith and Tom Brokaw-he and Levin went out on the porch alone and Levin consulted ten or so points he had jotted down on a piece of paper about why Turner and Time Warner were a perfect fit. Turner Broadcasting, he said, \"would be the pivot point in the center of the company,\" and Ted Turner would be a partner, not an employee. When he and Levin walked back into the house and Turner saw Brokaw, who had just arrived, he shouted, \"Hey, buddy. We just made a deal. We're going to merge.\" Brokaw remembers that Levin looked startled when Turner revealed their secret.\n\nTurner had traded a silent boss for a real one. But he still owned almost eleven per cent of the merged company, and he was not timid. He pressed Levin to sell off company airplanes and expensive American art and to curb costs at the Hollywood studio. He stepped in to stop a fifty-million-dollar sale of Warner Bros, movies to CBS, insisting that the Warner films should be offered first to its own cable networks. He won control of all new international channels, preventing Warner Bros. from spending millions to build a staff that would duplicate Turner Broadcasting's. He pushed for across-the-board budget reductions, and, as the Wall Street Journal reported, he even fired his own son, Robert E. (Teddy) Turner IV, who was a promotions manager for Turner Home Entertainment, bluntly warning him over a family dinner, \"You're toast.\"\n\nWhether by design or by accident, Levin began to use Turner for his own purposes. \"The edict from Gerry Levin was 'Let Ted be Ted,'\" a Levin confidant recalls. \"Time Warner was buttoned up and bureaucratic. Ted was a breath of fresh air, and Gerry used that to the advantage of the company.\" When they met with employees, he remembers, \"Ted would get up and say, 'I've got one suit. I don't spend my money on suits. I own ten per cent of the company and each dollar you waste, ten cents comes from me.'\" Levin remembers that he was \"very comfortable\" with Ted's saying whatever he wanted, and had no illusions that it could be any other way. Levin and many other Time Warner executives were pleasantly surprised that Turner was a team player. Within the Turner Broadcasting group, Gail Evans says, Turner didn't change the way he worked, except to occasionally say, \"I have to check with the boss.\"\n\nNo matter how many times Turner checked, however, he and Levin never grew close. They didn't communicate regularly. Turner was hurt that Levin, who is intensely private, never invited him to his home for dinner. They had business differences-Turner, for example, wanted Levin to fold the Warner Bros. television operations into Turner Broadcasting. He still resented Levin's veto of his potential purchase of NBC, believing that if he had succeeded he never would have sold his company and, he laments, \"I'd have bought Time Warner instead of going the other way.\" Levin, who then wore a thick mustache chopped at the ends, as if he'd got tired of shaving, was reclusive and weighed his words carefully; the six-foot-one Turner towered over him and was impulsive. Levin was a schemer; Turner could become so focussed on the moment that sometimes when he got off his horse he dropped the reins and the horse galloped away, leaving him stranded. \"There are probably not two more different individuals that I've ever worked with,\" Terry McGuirk says.\n\nInevitably, perhaps, after the Time Warner merger Turner and Murdoch declared war on each other. Turner said that Murdoch had to be stopped before he took over the media and used them as a weapon to advance his conservative agenda and his business interests. Turner asserts that men of good will can resolve differences between, say, Arabs and Israelis, yet he does not believe that it is possible to play Chamberlain to Murdoch's Hitler. \"How do you make peace with a mega-maniac?\" Turner said to me in a November, 1996, interview. \"Chamberlain tried to make peace. When you've got somebody like that, I don't think there's a spark of human decency in him-except he likes his family.\" Turner said that Murdoch's Fox News network would do in America what Murdoch had done in China, where he removed the BBC from his satellite system in order to gain favor with the government. Murdoch's New York Post taunted Turner, describing him as a doormat for foreign dictators, suggesting that he was wacky, and portraying Fonda as Hanoi Jane. The battle became so ferocious that executives in both camps grew concerned; after all, Fox wanted television shows from Warner Bros. and Warner Bros. needed Murdoch's satellites. Fox would need Time Warner cable systems to carry its new cable news service. In the end, business interests outweighed principles, a truce was arranged, and, though Turner has never altered his view of Murdoch, he began to focus on other things.\n\nWith McGuirk running Turner Broadcasting day to day, Turner had more time. And, with Time Warner's stock price soaring, he also had more money. In September of 1997, he was to be honored by the United Nations Association-USA, and he had the idea of giving a billion dollars-then a third of his wealth-to the United Nations. The Turners were flying to New York when Turner told his wife what he planned. \"I was extremely moved,\" Jane Fonda says, adding that she told her husband, \"Don't you think you should talk to your lawyers first?\" He did, and learned that he could not make the gift directly to the U.N.\n\nThe next day, as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalls, Turner walked into Annan's office and blurted, \"Hi, Kofi. I'm going to give you a billion dollars.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a joke,\" Annan says, shaking his head in wonderment.\n\nThat night, Turner announced that he would give a hundred million dollars a year for ten years to support such U.N. programs as the elimination of land mines, providing medicine for children, and easing the plight of refugees. He hired Tim Wirth, who eventually recruited a staff of thirty-two, to oversee the effort. Turner's only condition was that his money be used only minimally for administrative overhead. Annan remembers that Turner also said, \"All of you billionaires out there, watch out. I'm coming after you.\"\n\nTurner has written his own version of the Ten Commandments, which he keeps on typed cards in his wallet. Without prompting, he will read from a list that includes these vows: \"'I promise to care for planet earth and all living things thereon'; 'I promise to treat all persons everywhere with dignity, respect, and friendliness'; 'I promise to have no more than one or two children'; 'I reject the use of force'; 'I support the United Nations.'\" Along with his manifest generosity, Turner remains enough of a ham to seek a fitting reward: a Nobel Prize. \"I've thought about it a little bit,\" Turner said when I asked him. \"Of course I've thought of it.\"\n\nTurner is easily moved to tears. He sobbed openly when Princess Diana was killed. On a trip to China in October of 1999, with Fonda reading and CNN's Eason Jordan working, Turner put on his headphones and popped in the videotape of a popular Warner Bros. cartoon movie, \"The Iron Giant,\" the story of the friendship between a young boy and a metallic being from outer space who sacrifices himself for the sake of the planet. Jordan remembers looking over at his boss. \"Tears were streaming down his face,\" he says. \"I never saw anybody cry like that in my life.\" As the credits rolled, Turner called out, \"That's the saddest thing I've ever seen!\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAmerica and Russia still have some seven thousand nuclear weapons targeted at each other, and Turner is terrified that these-along with chemical and biological weapons-could fall into the wrong hands. He dismisses the Bush Administration's effort to build an anti-missile defense system as madness; the technology won't work, he says, and, in any case, it won't prevent weapons of mass destruction from being delivered by car, by ship, or in a suitcase. All these dangers are \"off the radar screen,\" he says. \"We have a huge job. Probably ninety-five per cent of the U.S. population doesn't know about it.\" Thus Turner's Nuclear Threat Initiative. To lead it, he has recruited former Senator Sam Nunn, who once chaired the Armed Services Committee, and who signed on only after Turner agreed to allow him a free hand. \"When he gets behind something, people know it's serious, and it's going to have the energy and resources,\" Nunn says. Most days, Turner is a fan of the cautious Nunn; some days, he worries that Nunn is fencing him in.\n\nTurner's miserable last year actually began a few years ago, when Fonda began spending more time in Atlanta and less time with him. She wanted to be with her daughter Vanessa Vadim, who had moved to Atlanta and was raising a child on her own. Fonda's daughter Lulu, whose father was a Black Panther, and whom Jane took in when she and Tom Hayden ran a California camp for troubled kids, had also moved to Atlanta. In addition, Fonda had started the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, and had taken up the cause of nurturing teen mothers. During this time (according to an E! biography of Fonda that aired last fall), Fonda started attending services at the Providence Missionary Baptist Church. Turner, who alternately describes himself as an atheist and an agnostic, told me his reaction: \"I had absolutely no warning about it. She didn't tell me she was thinking about doing it. She just came home and said, 'I've become a Christian.' Before that, she was not a religious person. That's a pretty big change for your wife of many years to tell you. That's a shock. I mean, normally that's the kind of thing your wife or husband would discuss with you before they did it or while they were thinking about it. . . . Obviously, we weren't communicating very well at that time.\"\n\n\"My becoming a Christian upset him very much-for good reason,\" Fonda says. \"He's my husband and I chose not to discuss it with him-because he would have talked me out of it. He's a debating champion. He saw it as writing on the wall. And it was about other things. He knew my daughter was having a baby and it would take me away from him. He needs someone to be there one hundred per cent of the time. He thinks that's love. It is not love. It's babysitting. I didn't want to tell you this. We went in different directions. I grew up.\" Turner's daughter Laura doesn't think religion per se was the real basis of their disagreement. She says, \"It was another male\"-Jesus. \"It took time away from him.\"\n\nThere were other differences, friends of both say, including Turner's libido and his insecurities. \"My problem is I love every woman I meet,\" Turner has said. He and Fonda visited marriage counsellors and psychiatrists, to no avail. On January 4,2000, they announced an official separation; before the announcement, Frédérique D'arragon, who is fifty-one, and has been in and out of Turner's life for more than thirty years, came back into it. She is almost a foot shorter than Turner, and prefers jeans to designer dresses. Fonda and D'arragon had lunch recently in Atlanta, and Fonda makes it clear that D'arragon will be available for Ted in ways she no longer can be: \"He needs to be taken care of. She has no children. And she's loved him a long time.\" But travelling with Ted has taken its toll on D'arragon, just as it did on Fonda. Turner admits that the persistent travel is \"driving her nuts.\"\n\nA close friend says that Turner is burdened by three things: an insecurity that can be traced back to his abusive father; a manic, restless nature; and lust. \"Each one of these is a great huge bear,\" the friend says. \"Turner must wrestle with three bears, and they sometimes overwhelm him.\" Fonda puts it another way: \"Why this guy didn't go under psychologically at age five, I don't know. It scarred him for life. It colors everything-his relationships, his anxieties . . .\"\n\nFonda and Turner insist that they still love each other; in fact, the best I have ever seen Turner look-his white hair washed and carefully combed, his thin white mustache trimmed, a chocolate-brown sports jacket nicely contrasting with pressed gray slacks, a burgundy tie, and brown Gucci loafers-was a December day in Atlanta when he and Fonda had a lunch date. Both friends and family are distressed by their split. But Fonda, despite her own notoriety as an actor and as a political activist, had lived in the shadow of three dominant husbands. By leaving Turner, she also announced her own liberation.\n\nTurner was despondent, and his sense of abandonment was heightened by the announcement, around the same time, that Time Warner was merging with AOL-more accurately, AOL was acquiring Time Warner. The price, based on the stock values of the companies on the day of the announcement, was pegged at a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars, the largest corporate marriage ever. Although Turner had been alerted to the merger discussions, he had not been invited by Gerald Levin to participate. \"Ted was not a strategic partner,\" a senior executive at Time Warner who is close to Turner told me. \"Gerry is a sole practitioner. He keeps things to himself. Ted was not in the loop. Yet Ted did not hesitate to endorse the deal.\" It was, after all, a growth strategy. Nor, according to an AOL strategist who was a party to the negotiations, was Turner's future role even a minor part of these discussions. What was talked about much more, he continued, was what a great fit CNN and AOL would be. \"You can AOL-ize CNN and do cross-promotions,\" the executives said enthusiastically. CNN, in fact, was desperately in need of promotion, for its ratings had plunged and its promotion budget had been cut.\n\nTurner would own four per cent (now just over three and a half per cent) of the new company and remain on the board, and he had won a vice-chairman title. But, while executives at the two companies respected Turner's many successes and his \"vision,\" they also found him unfathomable. One senior AOL executive who was working with Turner for the first time says, \"In meetings I've been in with him, he just sits there and in a piercing voice-louder than you would expect someone to talk-he interrupts or conveys a sense of 'Hurry up! Why am I here?' He gives off a feeling that he's in a rush, even if he's not doing anything.\"\n\nOver the next several months, as the two companies tried to get their executives working together and achieve the synergies they had touted, Turner was in Atlanta or New York no more than four or five days a month. He was not involved in budget details, as Terry McGuirk was, and soon McGuirk, an original Turner loyalist, signalled that he \"wanted out from under Ted,\" a senior member of the AOL Time Warner team explains. McGuirk admired Turner, but, if he was to be held responsible, then he wanted the authority, too.\n\nThere was one other difficulty. In the reorganized company, Steve Case was going to be the chairman and Levin the C.E.O., and the idea was to divide the company into separate spheres, each reporting to one of two presidents. Time Warner's Richard Parsons would oversee movies, music, publishing, legal affairs, and human resources. AOL's Robert Pittman would oversee AOL, cable, the magazines, television (including HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and the WB television network), and business development. \"By a process of elimination, it made sense for Terry McGuirk to report to Bob and for Ted to take a strategic role,\" a senior AOL Time Warner strategist says.\n\nSometimes Turner made light of his diminished role. Lou Dobbs remembers being invited to Turner's Montana ranch for a weekend. While they were fishing, Dobbs, who left CNN in 1999 to start an Internet venture, Space.com-and who returned last week to, among other things, anchor \"Moneyline News Hour\"-said, \"Ted, I outrank you. I'm C.E.O. and chairman.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting,\" Turner said. \"I'm also chairman of the Turner Foundation.\"\n\n\"Ted, that's nonprofit!\"\n\n\"What do you think Space.com is?\" Turner retorted, laughing.\n\nLink copied\n\nDobbs laughs, too, when telling this story, but, like many of Turner's friends, he is angry. \"He has not been treated with the respect due him,\" Dobbs says. Jane Fonda agrees. \"The way it was handled was really shocking,\" she says. \"It makes me mad. How dare they give him a phone call!\" Surely Turner did not feel that he was treated properly when CNN cancelled a pet project of his-a multipart documentary exploring the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He recruited a producer, George Crile, but, soon after Crile started work, Turner told him that he was encountering budget opposition at CNN. They would have to scale the project back to three hours. By October, 2000, it was down to a single hour. \"There's a lot of pressure to make the budgets,\" Turner explained, disappointed. In fact, he is so agitated by the budgeting strictures at CNN that, in December, he told me, \"I am going to produce, myself, ten hours on nuclear proliferation and chemical and biological warfare. I'll give first crack to CNN, and if they don't want it I'll give it to PBS.\" (By March, CNN's founder had given up on CNN documentaries. Together with former associates like Pat Mitchell, who is the president of PBS, and Robert Wussler, who had been a top Turner Broadcasting executive, he plans to team up with Bill Moyers for a series of PBS documentaries on world issues; the Turner Foundation will provide half the financing. \"Over the next few years I would hope we would do one hundred hours,\" Wussler says.)\n\nWhen he cut the Crile project from three hours to one, Tom Johnson says, \"Ted wasn't happy. I don't think he's happy with me. Ted knows I'm in a new world today.\" Turner was reminded of this \"new world\" when he invited me to sit in on a CNN executive-committee meeting on December 19th, and the invitation was rescinded. \"He invited you to a meeting that is not his meeting,\" an AOL Time Warner executive explained.\n\nThen, this past January, although Turner calls CNN \"the most profitable news operation in the world\"-it earned three hundred million dollars the previous year-its staff, of more than four thousand, was reduced by nearly ten per cent. Those who are gone include such Turner stalwarts as Elsa Klensch, Barbara Pyle, Nick Charles, Larry Woods, Gene Randall, and the Atlanta-based Turner Environment Division, with its show \"People Count,\" which Fonda sometimes hosted. On CNN evening programs, talk replaced news reports-often the shouting-head format that CNN inaugurated with \"Crossfire\" and which Fox News and MSNBC had copied and extended. \"Basically, the Fox prime-time schedule is just talk radio,\" Rick Kaplan, the former CNN/U.S. president, says.\n\nTom Johnson, who is worried about the future of CNN, says that Bob Pittman assured him that he and his colleagues in New York believed in CNN's mission. But Pittman's definition of CNN's mission may not match Johnson's or Turner's. Daily journalism is an inherently wasteful process: it involves waiting for calls to be returned, for airlines to fly, keeping forty-two bureaus functioning, chasing stories that don't pan out, and sometimes working for days on a single story. Will stockholders think this productive? As late as December, a longtime Turner executive predicted, \"Ted will protect us.\"\n\nLess than three months later, Turner was unable to protect two longtime lieutenants-Terry McGuirk and Steve Heyer. Turner says McGuirk and Heyer chafed at AOL Time Warner's demand that Turner Broadcasting's \"operating profits\" (EBITDA, which are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) grow by thirty-nine per cent in 2001-which Turner says is nearly double the actual profit-growth average of the company over the past five years. \"They were unhappy mainly that the financial goals they were given were unachievable without really hurting the company,\" Turner says.\n\nAOL Time Warner executives insist that the true profit-growth target for the Turner Broadcasting division is half that, and that Turner's percentage does not reflect significant accounting changes. (Nonsense, senior executives at Turner Broadcasting say, claiming that their operating profits in 2000 were just under a billion dollars and that their company-imposed goal for 2001 is nearly $1.4 billion; the growth target that AOL Time Warner presented to Wall Street for the entire company in 2001 is thirty-one per cent.) Associates say Pittman is disturbed that CNN has lost market share to Fox News and MSNBC; CNN's prime-time ratings for the first quarter of 2001 were down five per cent from last year, while Fox News's climbed by a hundred and twenty-six per cent and MSNBC's by seventeen per cent. Turner is particularly worried about Fox News, which is in fewer homes but has talk-show hosts like the conservative Bill O'Reilly, who is now reaching a larger audience than Larry King, CNN's ratings champion.\n\nTurner says that he is uncomfortable with what he believes are arbitrary budget goals-what he called the company's new preoccupation with \"short-term fluctuations\" in its stock price-saying, \"I never ran the company by the numbers.\" Pittman denies that the company is being run strictly by the numbers. \"I think CNN is one of the great assets in the world,\" he says. \"But it takes a long time to build a franchise based on reliability and trust. They got it. That's something you can't replace overnight. That's the core, the value.\" And, Pittman adds, \"everyone agreed on\" a growth-target number, including, he implies, McGuirk. McGuirk, asked about the growth target, refuses to comment. He does say, \"The numbers are given to us, not negotiated.\"\n\nTed Turner today gets more notice outside his company than in it. When Fidel Castro came to New York last year for a three-day summit meeting at the U.N., he wanted to spend one night having dinner with Turner, who flew in from Montana for the occasion. The dinner stretched past midnight, and Castro was in the middle of a long-winded story when Turner raised his hand and exclaimed, \"Fidel, this story is never going to end, is it? I got to go!\" Castro laughed as Turner exited. Turner was the first Western businessman to have a private audience with Russia's new President, Vladimir Putin, who, Turner remembers, used to drive him when Turner visited St. Petersburg and Putin was a deputy to the city's mayor. \"I learned the value of being nice to everyone,\" Turner says, jokingly. In a trip arranged by George Crile, last May, Turner was also among the few private citizens to visit a nuclear command center outside Moscow. General Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces, cautioned, \"Don't touch any buttons!\" There was a PowerPoint presentation, in English, delineating Russia's various nuclear forces. Turner learned that each of seven thousand warheads could obliterate everything within a one-to-two-mile radius before the radiation and the fires spread. Turner sat mute, Eason Jordan recalls, for an hour and a half, transfixed by what he heard and saw. \"It was the only time I ever saw him speechless,\" Jordan says.\n\nYakovlev and Putin, like Castro, watch CNN. \"The Carter Center has programs in sixty-five different nations,\" Jimmy Carter says. \"We deal with leaders of nations who have a human-rights problem or conflict. . . . We go to those countries, and they quite often do not have a U.S. embassy in them. Invariably, in the offices there will be a TV station tuned to CNN.\" They know about Turner, and they know, Carter adds, that Turner is a true citizen of the world, a man who speaks up for what he believes even when it offends his government. Carter describes Turner as a personal \"hero.\" Kofi Annan sees this in Turner's appeal. \"He and Castro have a similar quality,\" Annan says. \"They are folk heroes of a sort. You can have one hundred heads of state here, and most people will gravitate toward Castro. You can have one hundred media heads here, and people will gravitate toward Ted.\"\n\nIn mid-March, Turner made a two-day visit to Harvard. An evening appearance at the Kennedy School of Government drew a large audience, and he was introduced by Alex S. Jones, the director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, who said, \"Ted Turner changed America.\" Turner jumped up on the low platform, pumped Jones's hand, and started talking, with Jones still at his side. Turner used no notes. He wore a blue corduroy jacket and gray slacks. Perhaps it was the way he jumped up and, in his joltingly loud voice, started talking quickly, or the way he suddenly paused and drawled, \"Ahhhhhhhhhh\"; or perhaps it was the way he seemed to lapse into self-pity when he said, \"I'm just trying to do the best I can,\" or the way he raced from subject to subject, sometimes letting thoughts collide-how he was rejected by Harvard when he applied, and how he'd given Jane Fonda a hundred million dollars, and how, just recently, she bestowed more than twelve million of that sum on Harvard's School of Education for the study of gender and education, and how he wasn't a journalist but had related to the species since he sold newspapers as a boy-perhaps it was these quirks that caused the audience, as often happens when Turner speaks, to giggle. Michael Baumgartner, a first-year graduate student, initially thought Turner sounded drunk. Watching Turner speak is like watching live TV, with the audience wondering what will happen next.\n\nLink copied\n\nBut although at first people seemed to be laughing at Turner, the feeling in the room soon changed. On being told that President Bush earlier that day had abandoned a campaign pledge to establish \"mandatory reduction targets\" for carbon-dioxide emissions by power plants, Turner was momentarily silenced. \"That's heartbreaking news,\" he said finally. \"I mean, I can't take any more bad news. I've lost my job and my wife this year!\" Turner went on to talk about the environment, and about curbing nuclear weapons, and about his commitment to news. When he finished, students clamored to shake his hand.\n\nThat night, Turner was discreet about CNN. Asked about its future, he said, \"Well, I hope it's a bright one.\" But, while Turner thinks CNN has programmed \"too much\" talk, he has no idea how to cure its ratings woes: \"Quite frankly, I'm not sure I have the answers.\" Privately, he is concerned about a general dumbing down that is taking place in the media, putting \"DiSiprio\"-he means Leonardo DiCaprio-\"on the cover of Time . Obviously, it should be on the cover of People or Entertainment Weekly! \"\n\nBy the next morning, the man who confesses to a congenital inability to police a secret was no longer restrained. Turner did not criticize the recent round of cutbacks at CNN, but he did criticize the parent company's growth target. This was impossible to achieve, Turner said, without doing harm to CNN's journalism. \"I always wanted CNN to be the New York Times of the television business,\" he said, a little sadly.\n\nAlthough the AOL Time Warner merger took effect only in January, there have already been some successes. As the largest individual shareholder in the conglomerate, Turner is enthusiastic about a new emphasis on coördination and synergy. Of Gerald Levin's management over the past five years, Turner bluntly says, \"The Time Warner divisions did not coöperate the way they should have. . . . I think he did a pretty marginal job of running the company.\" Now, with roughly forty per cent of Americans using AOL to reach the Internet, AOL is vital in promoting each division of the company. In the eight months ending January 31st, for example, Pittman told Wall Street analysts, AOL had sold eight hundred thousand new subscriptions to Time Inc.'s different magazines. The company is in various businesses, Levin said at a conference earlier this month, but one word united them: \"subscriptions\"-a total of a hundred and thirty million subscribers.\n\nTurner, however, is afraid that when journalistic divisions like CNN shrink corporate executives may try to \"avoid doing stories that are critical of the big companies, like the oil companies and the automobile companies. It's not easy to do stories that are critical of G.E.-you know, nuclear-power-plant stories. When was the last time you saw stories on TV critical of G.E. or DuPont? Better to stay away from the corporations-they're the sponsors. That's the danger.\" Turner, to be sure, does not talk about the embarrassments of his own tenure, including CNN's unceasing coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder case and trial.\n\nAt another of his Harvard appearances-a session in which he was questioned by Jones and several others for an hour and then stayed for an hour more as the six finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting discussed their stories-Turner said, \"I've already been fired, and I probably will be again shortly.\" One of the Shorenstein Fellows rose and condescendingly suggested that Turner might follow the example of Henry Ford, who also left his job but who set up the Ford Foundation, which is \"one of the most influential forces for the framing of issues in the country. You have a life and a future and can use your contacts-\"\n\n\"I am,\" Turner interrupted, and he mentioned his gift to the U.N. Foundation. \"No other individual in the world is giving as much to the poor world as I am. I'm spending fifty million dollars in the United States, mostly on environmental and family-planning causes. Ahhhhhhhh . . . I mean, family planning is under attack. You know, pro-lifers have got control of the White House. Roe v. Wade is hanging on by a thread. A woman's right to choose? They want to take that away. We're fighting global warming.\" He mentioned the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the dues payment to the U.N. \"And let me tell you what else I'm doing. I'm very close to making an announcement of a personal partnership through our foundation with public broadcasting to fund important documentaries that Turner Broadcasting has dropped. . . . And I've been trying desperately to get my network. It won't be NBC, but it will start with an N-NTV. The good news? I'm gonna get my network. The bad news? It's in Russia! I'm gonna try and help freedom of the press. I mean, I am doing plenty, Bubba!\"\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether Turner will own a network in Russia. In early April, he announced a plan to purchase part of the network founded by the Russian press baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky. This pleased independent Russian journalists like Masha Lipman, the deputy editor of the magazine Itogi , who says, \"It will be much more difficult for the Russian authorities to play dirty jokes\" on Turner. But the hard questions, she says, are two: Who will control the journalistic enterprise-Turner or the Russian authorities? And will Turner receive real guarantees of editorial freedom? Turner's longtime colleague Bob Wussler says that Gazprom, the state-dominated monopoly that has asserted control over the TV network, told him and Turner, \"You go do a deal with Gusinsky and come back and we'll do a deal with you.\" And even though President Putin stopped short of offering what Wussler calls \"a ringing endorsement\" of press freedom when Turner asked for it, Wussler feels that \"Putin is a politician and can say just so much. We took it as a good sign.\" Last week, however, Turner was struggling to invent a formula to satisfy Gusinsky, Gazprom, and the journalists themselves. On the surface, the deal is consistent with Turner's world-diplomacy principle-\"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\" But it may also suggest a certain naïveté.\n\nTurner's ability to give his money away has diminished as his principal stock holding-AOL Time Warner-has declined by more than thirty per cent since the merger announcement, reducing his net worth by about two billion dollars. It is possible, he tells me, that he will end his association with the company entirely. He hasn't quite accepted the idea that his business career is largely over, but he believes that his primary mission now is to help save the world, and perhaps himself.\n\n\"For some reason, he has a guilty conscience,\" Jane Fonda told me. \"He went much further than his father thought he would. So what's left? To be a good guy. He knows he will go down in history. He won't go down as a greedy corporate mogul. Although he claims to be an atheist, at the end of every speech he says, 'God bless you.' He wants to get into Heaven.\" Fonda told me of a family outing in 1992 on the occasion of the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. They went to a matinée of a film about Columbus and in the darkened theatre someone screamed out a litany of Columbus's supposed sins. There was a silence, until Turner blurted, \"I never did that!\" Fonda reached over and soothed her husband by patting his knee and said, \"It's O.K., honey. I know you didn't.\" She now says, \"I did that a lot.\" Turner concedes, \"I wish I didn't apologize as much as I do.\"\n\nOver breakfast at the Charles Hotel, in Cambridge, I asked Turner why he felt so burdened. \"It's the position you're in,\" he said. \"Because I was at CNN, because I had commitments, because I did the Goodwill Games, because I was concerned, because I did all those documentaries, I developed a self-imposed sense of responsibility. If Gandhi and Martin Luther King could make the kind of sacrifices with their lives that they did, and that our parents did fighting in World War I and World War II, why couldn't I make sacrifices, too?\" At that, Turner looked up from his hearty chipped-beef-and-biscuit breakfast, in the middle of the hotel dining room, and, as people at nearby tables leaned forward to listen, he performed from memory parts of Thomas Macaulay's \"Horatius\":\n\nLink copied\n\nAnd how can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods. . . .\n\nHaul down the bridge, Sir Consul With all the speed ye may; I, with two more to help me, Will hold the foe in play. In yon straight path a thousand May well be stopped by three. Now who will stand on either hand, And keep the bridge with me?\n\n\"Pretty cool, huh,\" Turner said, grinning; he had, in the longer version that he recited, got almost every word right. \"If Horatius could do it, I can do it. He saved Rome. . . . He stopped the Etruscans.\" His smile widened, and he couldn't resist a final bow, with a loud \"heh-heh-heh.\" Then he leaned over and whispered, as if to a co-conspirator, \"I know a lot . My knowledge is my burden. If I didn't know so much, I could just go through life as a dilettante.\" He stood up and, watched by everyone in the room, walked briskly to the door.♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Booksmart flips the script on the typical teen comedy. Same goes for its costumes.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe film's costume designer explains the evolution of the high school comedy wardrobe and the inspirations for each character.\n\nby Rebecca Jennings\n\nBooksmart is not one of those teen movies where every character is a gazillionaire and wears Prada. To be fair, one of its characters is a gazillionaire, but he's sort of pathetic, and is, as is appropriate for 2019, a hypebeast.\n\nFor all the elements of the typical last-hurrah-of-high-school comedies that Booksmart expertly borrows from - its two main characters realize that in their single-minded quest to get into Ivy League schools, they've sacrificed a social life and decide that they have to go to at least one party before graduation - it also plays against some of these same stereotypes. You won't see the popular girls in school carrying tiny Chanel bags, for example, and when the leads undergo their \"makeover\" sequence, they end up in ... matching coveralls.\n\nIn short, Booksmart's costumes feel just as subversive as the film itself. In it, Molly, played by Beanie Feldstein, and Amy (Kaitlyn Devers), are the staunchly feminist and socially aware best friends, whose bedrooms are stuffed with Ruth Bader Ginsberg merch and, as its costume designer April Napier explains, wear blue throughout the film to prove their registered Democrat bonafides. Throughout the film, Amy's political patches sewn onto vintage denim and Molly's stuffy Ivy League uniform separates them from their far more chill peers.\n\nNapier designed the costumes for the film Lady Bird , which also features Feldstein and takes place at an upper-middle-class California high school; she spoke to Vox about the project and working with director Olivia Wilde, who wanted to highlight each character's sartorial identity while making it clear that none of them was a stereotype.\n\nAs Vox's film critic Alissa Wilkinson writes , \"No one in Booksmart , as it turns out, is an archetype - they're just people, doing their best. Becoming an adult often involves realizing that everything you assumed about someone was wrong, that people are much more interesting and complex than they seem.\"\n\nBelow, Napier chats about dressing the film's quirky cast of teen characters: the hypebeast, the skaters, the hot bully, and one particularly well-dressed cocaine fan, and also discusses how teen movie wardrobes have changed over the decades.\n\nRight off the bat, we see our main character, Molly (Beanie Feldstein), in a turtleneck, blazer, and tights. It's the last day of high school in Southern California, which feels hilariously out of place.\n\n[Director Olivia Wilde] made a reference that it was the last day and everyone is in short shorts and ready for summer, not paying attention to school. But she had a memory from when she first came to Los Angeles from the East Coast, where she always wore a turtleneck and a brown corduroy suit and never felt like she fit in. It was really important for us to make sure that Beanie held that same [aesthetic].\n\nShe's so East Coast-based in her looks and in her thinking: She wants to be a lawyer and the youngest woman on the Supreme Court, so we wanted to keep her very collegiate and inappropriate for the time. I ended up getting that plaid jacket on some weird website called Chadwicks of Boston, which sold very traditional clothes, and I thought, that's exactly what she should wear. That's where she would buy her clothes, on a weird website called Chadwicks of Boston. It keeps her very separate from the rest of the crew.\n\nThe other kids at Crockett High School feel so realistically dressed. How did you start that research process into what Southern California teens are wearing right now? Did you stalk Instagram?\n\nNot at all. I never tend to use Instagram as a tool, which is strange because I think a lot of people do. I tend to look at old photographs and other films, and just imagine it in my mind. I like to use things that are more vintage, real, and authentic. I tend to thrift things or do flea markets or costume stores, which I did for Kaitlyn's character [Amy], who is much more vintage-inspired and bohemian, as a lover of the planet and feminism.\n\nI think about who their influences are, the music they listen to, their intention. A costume designer is there to support the action and story and help them define their characters. We knew [Kaitlyn] should have a denim jacket because Beanie had a plaid wool jacket; I knew she should be in pants because Beanie was in a skirt. Her denim jacket we bought vintage and then thrifted on eBay and Etsy a lot of political patches. She wears a bolo tie, which I think you can never really see, but it says \"Democrat\" on it.\n\nSo much of the film riffs on and flips the script of the typical teen comedy. Were there any parts where you were aiming to do that with the costumes?\n\nIt's important to be realistic. They're all so different, there's Beanie being collegiate, there's Kaitlyn being the activist, there's Billie Lourd [Gigi], whom Olivia had said wants to be like a specter, who just shows up all the time and the continuity of her clothes doesn't matter, she can just show up in a different outfit every time - a wild child, a la Penny Lane from Almost Famous. Then there's Jared, who my assistant Katina was like, \"That guy's gotta be a hypebeast.\" We did this whole thing of him being the poor rich kid, really struggling to buy all the coolest things. We used the obsession with skate culture here in Los Angeles. Kat was friends with Cali Dewitt [the designer of Kanye's Life of Pablo merch], so he made those T-shirts and sweatshirts for us that were a spoof of his own commodification.\n\nJared is so interesting because he's so wealthy but so sad. How do you show this rich kid with embarrassing taste?\n\nIt's hard, but the actors really embraced their characters - there was Noah Galvin [George], where he wears his black turtleneck as Bob Fosse, I'm-a-Broadway-director thing, Austin Crute being so outrageous playing Alan and embracing a queer sensibility. They made it really easy. We overdid Jared so much when we shot the scene on the boat. He walked on the set and everybody was like, \"Oh my god, he looks amazing. He looks so cool,\" and we were like, \"No he doesn't! What?\" He's got layers and layers of everything that's cool which is such a sad, pathetic thing. In my mind the coolest people are like, Patti Smith, who wears the most simple, discrete thing. They don't need to it show off on their bodies because it oozes out of their pores.\n\nYou see that so well in the character of Hope, the mean hot girl.\n\nExactly, and all her stuff is thrifted as well. [Diana Silvers] has the most simple, beautiful look anyway so you want to keep her as minimal as possible.\n\nAnd that's the opposite of Gigi, who's this coked out fairy princess. How did you come up with those crazy, super girly, amazing outfits?\n\nAren't they great? Billie really is that character, she's wild and free and spontaneous. We knew that she should have a lot of sparkle and feathers and fur and be outrageous. We wanted to keep her palette very light because a lot of her scenes were shot at nighttime. I did a lot of vintage on her and rented a lot of stuff from costume houses.\n\nI went to the Ruby, a high-end designer rental place in Los Angeles. I thought about sparkle in bringing the bindi onto her forehead and this 1930s veil that she wears, which is from the vintage store Please and Thank You in Los Angeles. When she jumps off the boat, she had two stunt doubles, so all that stuff had to be multiples, so I think that dress came from Forever 21 or something. When she falls in the pool, the idea was that she would just find a fur coat from Nick's aunt's closet and be like, \"I don't give a fuck, I'll just jump in the pool with that.\"\n\nThere's such a stark difference between what the cool kids are wearing and what Amy and Molly are wearing. Amy and Molly clearly put a lot of care and intent into their outfits but the cool kids are more \"whatever.\"\n\nThey're the leads, and the story's about them being academic and focused and obsessed with doing research and being detailed in their work. It's clear to them that everything they put on their bodies makes a statement or is important to who they are intrinsically. That's why they're so different but they also work together - they represent the same things about being powerful and affecting change.\n\nWhereas everyone else is a little bit more \"whatever.\" That whole skate crew, they were fun to do but we gave them a lot of freedom, because they came in and they didn't give a fuck about anything, so we could use a lot of their own clothes. I remember Nico Hiraga [Tanner] came out of his trailer during the party scene, and we had decided he was going to wear white overalls, and he came out with them on backwards and the straps twisted around and was like, \"I just thought maybe I'd wear it this way!\" And I was like, \"Dude, do it.\" It's so important to honor the characters, specifically because those guys were cast for who they were. You have to honor that and let them inform what the character would do.\n\nThe gender presentation was done so playfully in the film, especially in the look of Ryan. She's Amy's adorable crush-worthy object, but she's also so laid back and low-key.\n\nWhen I got the script it said, \"She wore a polo shirt to prom,\" so I knew that she wasn't going to be so fashion-centric, and she was going to be really genuine to herself. The woman who plays her, [Victoria Ruesga] is sponsored by [the skate brand] Deathwish , so we got some T-shirts from them that we used.\n\nAmy and Molly's matching jumpsuits are a big part of the film. How'd you come up with the outfits themselves, and the fact that they're matching?\n\nIt came about very organically. You have to think, a) they're pulling from clothes they already have in their closet. Who would they look to as the coolest people in the world? I thought, \"Oh, Hanoi Jane, the era of Jane Fonda in the Vietnam War, and Rosie the Riveter.\" And a jumpsuit looks cool anyway, so it'd be likely that they'd both have blue jumpsuits in Amy's room.\n\nMolly has drawers that are well-labeled in Amy's room full of her own clothes because they spend so much time together, so I put them both in those outfits thinking that one or the other would wear them, and then suddenly I was like, \"Wait, you should both wear them!\" We suggested that to Olivia and she really liked that idea, because it brings them together and keeps them united but it also is their idea of what's cool and powerful and how they're just gonna kill it.\n\nThey ultimately change out of those outfits and into some sequined dresses that happened to be in the back of Ms. Fine (Jessica Williams)'s car. All three actresses have different body types and have super different styles, so how'd you make it work?\n\nI credit Olivia with this, because Olivia was like, \"They have to change.\" In the original script they fall off the boat and end up soaking wet, so they would have to change [outfits]. But they didn't go off the boat, so I was like, \"What is that gonna be?\" I was trying to think about what Ms. Fine would have in the back of her car. Well, what does every woman have in the back of her car? It was scripted as some yoga clothes, a tank top, leggings, and a weird, like, Ukranian Miss America sparkly dress, and I was like, \"Wait, that isn't gonna look better than these two jumpsuits.\" So what could we do that looks as good?\n\nJessica Williams is six foot tall and those girls are like, 5-3, so we had to think of what she would have in the back of her car, and it has to be outrageous. It's a comedy, so you have some freedom where it doesn't have to be that attached to reality. I had to push myself a little more to embrace the idea that it can also be outlandish because we're making straight-up comedy, so we came up with the idea of keeping them in the blue, to carry on that theme of them being hardcore Democrats.\n\nBut maybe Ms. Fine had in her car some old sparkly club shirts. Since they'd be shirts for Ms. Fine, they'd be so long on the girls that they'd be dresses. I think I got both of them at Jet Rag in LA. They're old '80s sequined dresses. I let Amy's just drape off of her, and with Molly's I added the collar, appliqués and a belt so it'd be more in line with her buttoned-up, collegiate look. They worked really well because they were shiny, and we got so much reflection bouncing off of them in the night shoots.\n\nYou mentioned you did a lot of research in watching old teen comedies in preparation. Have you noticed an evolution in the way the \"cool kids\" dress versus the quirky main characters?\n\nThe thing that's rough for me now is that it seems like a lot of people are influenced so much by social media. People tend to dress a lot alike more - an idea gets commodified so exponentially because there's so much access to information. I grew up in the days of yore during punk rock where you didn't have access to information.\n\nYou were really on your own to read books or watch old movies and figure out who you are, and you made a lot of mistakes along the way. I think mistakes are really important for individual development, and I feel like people right now are scared that they're going to not look cool, because there's a blog to tell you what to do, and I think it's crippling to individuality. And if there is an individual, it gets commodified so quickly.\n\nI did a movie about 10 years ago called Bad Words and I was really obsessed with that normcore look. Normcore itself began as an underground reactive idea to labels, but then it got commodified, too. How many thousands of pairs of white dad trainers are out there now? You can pay a thousand bucks for a Balenciaga pair right now. Fashion always comes from the streets - it always starts with poor individual artists and musicians who influence it, but now because there's so much media presence it happens so fast and so intensely.\n\nYou also did the costumes for Lady Bird, which takes place almost 20 years before Booksmart , but they both share this kind of laid-back, California style. I'm wondering what you'd put Lady Bird in if she were in Booksmart .\n\nI guess that would be after her being in New York and being really grounded. Maybe she'd wear some kind of 1920s Bauhaus outfit. Or she'd wear the most simple thing because she's so comfortable in her skin at this point that she doesn't care.\n\nSign up for The Goods' newsletter.

      "text": "Booksmart flips the script on the typical teen comedy. Same goes for its costumes.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe film's costume designer explains the evolution of the high school comedy wardrobe and the inspirations for each character.\n\nby Rebecca Jennings\n\nBooksmart is not one of those teen movies where every character is a gazillionaire and wears Prada. To be fair, one of its characters is a gazillionaire, but he's sort of pathetic, and is, as is appropriate for 2019, a hypebeast.\n\nFor all the elements of the typical last-hurrah-of-high-school comedies that Booksmart expertly borrows from - its two main characters realize that in their single-minded quest to get into Ivy League schools, they've sacrificed a social life and decide that they have to go to at least one party before graduation - it also plays against some of these same stereotypes. You won't see the popular girls in school carrying tiny Chanel bags, for example, and when the leads undergo their \"makeover\" sequence, they end up in ... matching coveralls.\n\nIn short, Booksmart's costumes feel just as subversive as the film itself. In it, Molly, played by Beanie Feldstein, and Amy (Kaitlyn Devers), are the staunchly feminist and socially aware best friends, whose bedrooms are stuffed with Ruth Bader Ginsberg merch and, as its costume designer April Napier explains, wear blue throughout the film to prove their registered Democrat bonafides. Throughout the film, Amy's political patches sewn onto vintage denim and Molly's stuffy Ivy League uniform separates them from their far more chill peers.\n\nNapier designed the costumes for the film Lady Bird , which also features Feldstein and takes place at an upper-middle-class California high school; she spoke to Vox about the project and working with director Olivia Wilde, who wanted to highlight each character's sartorial identity while making it clear that none of them was a stereotype.\n\nAs Vox's film critic Alissa Wilkinson writes , \"No one in Booksmart , as it turns out, is an archetype - they're just people, doing their best. Becoming an adult often involves realizing that everything you assumed about someone was wrong, that people are much more interesting and complex than they seem.\"\n\nBelow, Napier chats about dressing the film's quirky cast of teen characters: the hypebeast, the skaters, the hot bully, and one particularly well-dressed cocaine fan, and also discusses how teen movie wardrobes have changed over the decades.\n\nRight off the bat, we see our main character, Molly (Beanie Feldstein), in a turtleneck, blazer, and tights. It's the last day of high school in Southern California, which feels hilariously out of place.\n\n[Director Olivia Wilde] made a reference that it was the last day and everyone is in short shorts and ready for summer, not paying attention to school. But she had a memory from when she first came to Los Angeles from the East Coast, where she always wore a turtleneck and a brown corduroy suit and never felt like she fit in. It was really important for us to make sure that Beanie held that same [aesthetic].\n\nShe's so East Coast-based in her looks and in her thinking: She wants to be a lawyer and the youngest woman on the Supreme Court, so we wanted to keep her very collegiate and inappropriate for the time. I ended up getting that plaid jacket on some weird website called Chadwicks of Boston, which sold very traditional clothes, and I thought, that's exactly what she should wear. That's where she would buy her clothes, on a weird website called Chadwicks of Boston. It keeps her very separate from the rest of the crew.\n\nThe other kids at Crockett High School feel so realistically dressed. How did you start that research process into what Southern California teens are wearing right now? Did you stalk Instagram?\n\nNot at all. I never tend to use Instagram as a tool, which is strange because I think a lot of people do. I tend to look at old photographs and other films, and just imagine it in my mind. I like to use things that are more vintage, real, and authentic. I tend to thrift things or do flea markets or costume stores, which I did for Kaitlyn's character [Amy], who is much more vintage-inspired and bohemian, as a lover of the planet and feminism.\n\nI think about who their influences are, the music they listen to, their intention.

I mean, worldwide.\"\n\nby Eric Johnson\n\nIf you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\n\nAs the result of a now-infamous photoshoot in 2017, in which she held up a Halloween mask that resembled a beheaded Donald Trump, Kathy Griffin's life has changed forever. In addition to destroying job prospects and alienating her from longtime TV pal Anderson Cooper, the controversy has also forced Griffin to learn a lot about bots and coordinated harassment campaigns on social media.\n\n\"I had to educate myself about all these Trumpers and the subgroups and the rise of Nazism among young people,\" Griffin said on the latest episode of Recode Decode . \"Because I'm from Oak Park, Illinois, and it was this really big deal ... when the Nazis marched in Skokie .\"\n\nGriffin told Recode's Kara Swisher that while she was being threatened by people who ostensibly supported President Trump (\"Their favorite method is, they would say, 'I want to shoot you in the cunt, cut your head off and then stuff your head up your cunt,'\" she recalled) she was not contacted by anyone from Twitter's safety team.\n\n\"He should resign,\" Griffin said of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. \"The first order of business, he needs to resign ... Remember when he was covering Ferguson? I remember thinking, he's like this forward-thinking guy and he's going to document the riots in Ferguson, and that's good for him. Next thing you know, he's not banning any of these Nazis or super-far-right QAnon folks and stuff. I don't believe they don't have the capability.\"\n\nMore generally, she said social media companies are \"complicit\" in fraudulent elections around the world and said that if CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to join her for dinner - as he did with families around America in 2017 - she'd say, \"Get the fuck out, you fucking cheater.\n\n\"First of all, we have to get more people in elected positions that know what social media is, that know how it works,\" Griffin said. \"They don't know the questions to ask and I thought Zuckerberg's testimony was frightening.\"\n\nYou can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Google Podcasts , Pocket Casts , and Overcast .\n\nBelow, we've shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara's conversation with Kathy.\n\nKathy Griffin: Woo! Kara Swisher - Your headliner, Kara Swisher, is here.\n\nSit down, sit down.\n\nAll right, I just started with my funnies.\n\nAll right, listen, we have a lot to talk about. We were just talking about ...\n\nNo shit.\n\nNo shit. I don't know where to begin. Why don't you explain the photo? Just talk about the photo.\n\nOkay. So one of the things that I'm very open about is I'm 58 years and proud of it, 58, look at this body! Look at me! I'm a role model. All right so, I've been canned from Bravo because of the piece of shit Andy Cohen with his no talent.\n\nRight.\n\nNo, if you could name a skill set, I'm all ears.\n\nAll right, okay.\n\nI thought so. But I've been dealing with ageism in my industry for a long time. And since I was about 40, they've been trying to put me out to pasture. I don't have a big Lorne Michaels type or a Judd Apatow type to have my back or a studio or anything. Sometimes when you're out of work, you'll do little silly things like that. I've done it before. I'll just take some wacky pictures, put them up on my social media and try to make you guys laugh. That day I worked with a shooter named Tyler Shields and he had taken some other photos of me before that were good. He's a good shooter. But I'm a little pissed at him because he won't give me the copyright and that picture changed my life irrevocably.\n\nBut he came over, just him and a couple of bros. The very last photo, we had taken a bunch of silly ones which never saw the light of day and the very last photo, we did collaborate and say, \"Let's do a photo that shames Trump in some way.\" And I did it in response to, even though I can't stand Megyn Kelly, but I also didn't like when Trump said \"there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\" So the inspiration was as deep as this, \"see if you can can handle it.\"\n\nI just thought, all right, let's see how he likes it when there's blood coming out of his wherever. And so it was a Halloween mask and it was one of my styrofoam wig heads. Because the mask kept folding, like his balls I assume. Oh, they're dragging on the floor, he trips on them every morning. But anyway, sorry, we'll stay on topic.\n\nAll right. Thank you for that vision though, go ahead.\n\nGod, poor Stormy, can you imagine?\n\nYeah, okay.\n\nWhat she's seen. Anyway, so took the photo to be like subversive, I'd say, more than funny. Look, if people think it's a joke and it makes them laugh, that's fine. But I kinda felt like it was a little more of a, just like a middle finger.\n\nRight, yep.\n\nWhat happened was, took the photo and I was so naïve that the photographer for some reason gave it to TMZ. So if you guys don't know this, TMZ is a guilty pleasure blog, run by a self-loathing gay man named Harvey Levin. And his big gig is that he has a fucking vault and everybody in Hollywood is scared of his vault. Well, I say open the fucking vault, all right, I got nothing to hide. So I'm not afraid of those guys anymore, but I will say in my business, people think that TMZ is the news. They pretty much think it's the Post. The Washington one, all right? Denver Post. But anyway, it started with the photo and I believe the title was ...\n\nDid you think at all there was any possibility because of the headless ...\n\nNot for a minute. I thought, this will be on a gay blog for two days. I really thought, I was clearly ... I actually purposely did a stoic look on my face because normally I'm very animated. I purposely wore this high collar thing. And I was holding up a Halloween mask. By the way, if it had been a full body dummy, that probably would have been fine.\n\nSo then Harvey Levin was started with the, \"Kathy Griffin has joined ISIS and severed the president's head.\" Which, I'm not a surgeon but I don't think that's feasible. That he would then go back to work. \"Work.\" So it spread like wildfire and I love that whole AMI flipping. So then all those other publications picked it up very, very rapidly.\n\nBut you were in ISIS, that you were in ISIS. But it was a lark, this was ... You didn't think possibly tasteless, you weren't worried that he was actually president and there had been threats and things like that.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then there were the Al Qaeda beheadings or anything like that. You weren't ...\n\nNo, but I will tell you I did a tragic apology video, which I still kept up. Because my good pal, Rosie O'Donnell, who is the preeminent expert at being trolled by Donald Trump, he's been after her for, what, 13 years. And she called me and she said, \"What if Daniel Pearl's mother saw this?\" And that's why I did the apology video. When then all my comedian friends called me and they said, \"Why did you apologize?\"\n\nI just want to be clear, everyone turned on me, left, right, and center. The right wing had a field day and they still are. That photo's in the new NRA ad, it's in the new National GOP ad, it was in several local GOP races during the midterms.\n\nIt's been manipulated, it shows up at every rally. People make a lot of more Trumps holding my head, stuff like that. So in the way that it went more than viral is not something I could have seen because I wasn't aware they had that apparatus ready to go. Trump's calling ...\n\nYou called it a wood chipper.\n\nI call it the wood chipper because it's really no different than what they did to Little Marco and Lyin' Ted and stuff. I was sort of the first celebrity. The reason I ...\n\nWell, Rosie O'Donnell, right? The names.\n\nYes, but she didn't have to go under federal investigation by two federal agencies. So what happened was the next day I got a call from my attorney and he said the Secret Service has opened a file on you, and the U.S. Attorney's office. The part that I want to tell people, because I want people to know their rights and there's a lot of mythology about what they can and can't do. But they wanted me to go downtown to the jail downtown in a jumpsuit and cuffs and they wanted video of a perp walk. Over my dead body would that happen.\n\nBecause by the way, I did show that photo to my lawyers before I posted it. I'm not stupid, I work in the First Amendment, it's my commodity. And my lawyers - rightly so - said, \"Yeah, it's well within the bounds of the First Amendment.\" So A) I didn't break the law, B) I didn't violate the First Amendment.\n\nSo I didn't know what they had in mind, but the investigation, I think, was to intimidate me. And my entire tour, the rest of my tour was canceled within 12 hours. And TMZ was reporting the tour cancellations in real time, which was odd. And then I just became toxic and everybody became scared of me and stuff like that.\n\nSo you had checked with your lawyers that this was okay to publish.\n\nYeah, I sent it to him and I said, \"Can I post this?\" And he said, \"Yes.\"\n\nDid any time you think that it was tasteless or something like that, just because he's the president, whatever you think of him as the president?\n\nNo, because it's him.\n\nRight.\n\nThe reason I did something so extreme with him ... First of all, I've known this moron for 25 years. One time he hired me to roast him. So he acts like he doesn't know my shtick, he does.\n\nOkay. What did you say at the time, during that roast?\n\nOh, well first of all, like a typical bully, when I saw him at that fakakta golf course that we're all paying for, Bedminster, whatever it's called, and the only reason I did it is because Liza was gonna sing. And you can't leave Liza alone with Donald Trump, I mean, even you know that, Kara. It's not safe. And she was on her happy pills that day, so I just wanted to keep an eye on her. And so when Trump approached me like every other bully, he had hired me to roast him and comes toward me with the fucking gut hanging out and his balls are filling his pleats. He's so gross.\n\nAnyway, he comes up and he's like, \"Uh-oh, there she is, don't make any jokes about the hair.\" So of course, I made as many jokes as I could - but I did touch his hair, though, that day. And he didn't feel it, which I thought was incredible. I touched it and he had no reaction to it. So I did it a second time, and he still didn't even feel it. So it's like a shellacked sculpture: Billy Ray Cyrus meets combover.\n\nBelieve it or not, when I knew him during the NBC days, I don't mean to defend Hollywood but honestly, nobody took him seriously. I mean, I would see him just on roundabouts, if I was promoting My Life on the D-List or one of the specials and he'd be doing The Apprentice . Or I'd see around New York in some way and he would show up at the opening of an envelope. There was an envelope opening one time. I actually spent quite a bit of time with him.\n\nOne time, there was a roast for Larry King, it was like his 120th birthday party, I think. And so there was a dais and as you know, the weirdest thing about a dais is the audience is watching you eat dinner prior to the little roasts. And I was in between the Donald and Gilbert Gottfried, I have never been more in love with Gilbert in my life. Because Trump just, it was just that like wah, wah, wah, the Charlie Brown teacher, and he kept saying non-sequentorial shit that made no sense. And I knew he was stupid, but I didn't know he was Britney Spears stupid. Like happy to be stupid. Oh Britney's like fine with it.\n\nAnd so the reason I wanted to do something really dramatic with the photo is truly, I remember watching every day of the Watergate hearings and I truly never thought in my lifetime anything like this could happen. And now I believe it's worse.\n\nAll right, so you put the photo out ...\n\nI said to the photographer, I didn't have a publicist ...\n\nBut there one other thought, because at one point Hillary Clinton decided it was Perseus and Medusa.\n\nThat hurt. So Hillary Clinton, who I worship, she puts in her audiobook, she goes, \"And all the fuss about Kathy Griffin, it was obviously a send-up of Perseus and Medusa.\" Which I've never heard of. I just need you guys to back me up when in the other interviews, I go, \"It was a send-up of Perseus and Medusa.\" Is that like a Greek story?\n\nYes.\n\nSounds Greek. Does somebody's head get cut off?\n\nMedusa's, yes.\n\nShe's a woman.\n\nYes.\n\nOh, it would have been a send-up. I get it now, I'm the woman.\n\nYes, got it. She had snakes on her hair.\n\nI have curly hair.\n\nIf you put her face in front of people, they turn to stone. You don't ... Okay, all right.\n\nThere's a lot of people I'd like to turn to stone. But ...\n\nSo in the 24 hours, the idea was that you were inciting violence, suggesting assassination.\n\nYes.\n\nIn 24 hours, suddenly all the virality went into it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo you were canceled by the internet, essentially.\n\nYeah, and also everybody felt the need to make a grand statement. So CNN was first in line. And then actually on the ticker it said, \"CNN fires ISIS member Kathy Griffin from the New Year's Eve broadcast.\"\n\nSo just to be clear, you're not a member of ISIS, right?\n\nI worked at the gift shop for a week. First of all, they get up too early. They're on those jungle bars at 6:00 am. That is not my gig. By the way, it's taken me a long time to even be able to make that joke because I've had so many people confront me on the street and they're convinced I'm in ISIS. And they're tying me in with pedophiles and something, QAnon?\n\nQAnon.\n\nYeah, okay, am I Q? Are you Q?\n\nNo.\n\nWho's Q?\n\nSomeone.\n\nAll right, there's not really a Q, right?\n\nI don't even want to go into it.\n\nOkay. But that's my role now, I have to know all this shit. I had to learn all the Nazis, now I know all the fucking Nazis, the Proud Boys, they all come at me. And some guy named Charlie Kirk, who's got fans that are like cult members. And they don't play.\n\nSo online, the death threats were immediate. But then because ...\n\nThe death threats range from ...\n\nThey range from, well, the most popular one was, we want to cut your head off, we want to stuff it up your pussy and then cut you in the middle. That was their most popular way of wanting to kill me. And it was graphic. So the way the tour got canceled was, people started calling these theaters, and I really don't blame the theater owners.\n\nAnd putting death threats in ...\n\nBecause when you're normally doing Mamma Mia or Blue Man Group , you're not used to someone saying, \"I don't want to go see this ISIS member do comedy.\" So I later found out that they were all robocalls, which was devastating to me.\n\nSo when I talk about the Trump woodchipper, I've just learned so much. I have a weird feeling I might show up in some of that David Pecker stuff. Because now that AMI has OK and Life and Style, I wouldn't be surprised if there was an email from Don Jr. saying ... Don Jr. said on Good Morning America , \"Our family just doesn't want to ruin Kathy Griffin's career, we want to decimate her.\" And he's Eddie Munster from the show The Munsters .\n\nI have a lot of respect for him and his girlfriend. So the reason I tell the story is, it is in fact historic. So I did a lot of research on this because I didn't want to be spouting off, but I am actually the first person that has had a sitting United States president use the full power of the Oval, the first family, the Department of Justice, and the entire right-wing media to try to ruin a private citizen. And I happen to think being a 58-year-old female comedian with a big mouth and everything antithetical to what he believes in is why he sort of chose me. And I also didn't have an infrastructure in place to really protect me. So it's been a long slog.\n\nSo instantly, you got the death threats?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd we'll get to the social media companies in a minute and what they do.\n\nYes, fuck them.\n\nYou have an issue with Jack Dorsey.\n\nIf Jack Dorsey's here, I'm going to slap him in the face.\n\nOkay. All right, he's not.\n\nHe's not a god, calm down. Elon Musk is crazy too, so don't be like falling into that fucking cult. Elon Musk, that fucking guy's nuts.\n\nAll right, speaking of which, you're investigated ...\n\nHe went out with a girlfriend of mine and he parked outside her house for four fucking days.\n\nOkay.\n\nRight, that guy's gonna send you to Mars in four years? Don't count on it. He said that, SpaceX, we're going to Mars in four years. You know how much oxygen, 0.1 percent.\n\nRight, okay.\n\nSo what do you do when you get to Mars? You don't breathe, Elon. How do you deal with these people?\n\nI've interviewed him many times, he says he wants to die on Mars, just not on landing.\n\nFine. He can do it in four hours, according to him.\n\nOkay. They investigated you, they put you on the do-not-fly list.\n\nI was on the no-fly list for two months. The Department of Justice called ...\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they thought ...\n\nCredible threat to the president.\n\nYes. I have a very good ... I got Bloomed by that piece of shit, Lisa Bloom. So I had a disastrous press conference and she's horrible and I'm also allowed to say that, because it's only my opinion. She is bad and a fake feminist. All right, so then I had to call my actual First Amendment attorney who I've been with for years, who actually was at a funeral and didn't pick up his phone that day. So that's kind of how it went down, so that's how I got Bloomed. But his name is Alan Isaacman and he won the landmark Supreme Court case, Jerry Falwell vs. Hustler magazine. So my theory has been, if you can get Larry Flynt off, you can handle me.\n\nAnd he did a very good job and he was very effective. Because the DOJ called his office every single day. \"Is she coming in? Is she coming in today? Is she coming in?\" And I just thought that sounded far and above what they would typically do, certainly to a comedian. So he had to negotiate that I wouldn't go downtown and do the perp walk but I was interrogated under oath, in his office. And what they were considering, they took two months to consider whether or not to charge me with conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States.\n\nWow.\n\nWhich holds a lifetime sentence. So prior to my interrogation, my lawyer said, it wasn't a situation where if I fuck up he can go, \"I need a moment with my client.\" It wasn't like that. And so he said, I'll never forget him saying. \"I love ya, kid, but you fuck up and you leave in cuffs.\" So it was a very serious matter and we had practiced and done murder rooms and all that stuff.\n\nRight, so you're on the do-not-fly, so you couldn't go anywhere.\n\nCouldn't go anywhere. And I make my living by touring, so that was bad.\n\nThat was bad. And other celebrities had insulted the president, Michelle Wolf did and got in trouble.\n\nYeah, she did the White House Correspondents dinner, which I attended, by the way, and she was hilarious. So that was Matt Schlapp and his beard wife making that bullshit up.\n\nOkay.\n\nCould you imagine fucking Matt Schlapp while he looks at Channing Tatum on a video? No, he's super straight, he loves vagina. All right, so that's the crowd Trump runs with, so fuck him.\n\nI actually was at the White House Correspondents dinner, Michelle did really well and I saw Matt and his wife Mercedes leaving and they started tweeting that the whole room, there's this mass exodus. And that just wasn't true. So now that it's happened to me, I'm determined that it won't happen to anybody else.\n\nOther male celebrities, Johnny Depp, Snoop Dogg.\n\nMorrissey.\n\nMorrissey.\n\nYeah, Peter Fonda.\n\nRight.\n\nThey all just got ...\n\nSaid similar things, said threatening things.\n\nYes, allegedly. I mean, they were harmless, but I talked to Peter Fonda and he said he just had a 10-minute phone call with the Secret Service and that was it. I know Johnny Depp was just mysteriously photographed with his Make-A-Wish kid four days later. And he looked hammered even during the picture, I'm not gonna lie. But he had the whole team from Pirates of the Caribbean come in and make sure he could be up and working. So I think in a way, I was the perfect target for that.\n\nPerfect target, so an easy target.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo one of the things you said, there's no bad publicity ... There is bad publicity.\n\nYes, I learned that. There is such a thing as bad publicity.\n\nRight, because your previous career had been, you didn't mind trashing people.\n\nOh, I've been in Hollywood trouble, but never two federal agencies.\n\nSo Hollywood trouble would be?\n\nHollywood trouble is when I won my first enemy ... My first enemy, I got a lot of those now. When I won my first Emmy and I wanted to do a speech that was funny because I think it's funny when people thank Jesus for awards. So I won my first Emmy and I said, \"I just want to say Jesus had nothing to do with this. Suck it, Jesus, this award is my god now.\" So religious groups took out full-page ads in USA Today.\n\nYeah, I remember \"Suck it, Jesus.\"\n\nI got fired from a DirecTV commercial.\n\nRight, okay.\n\nBecause I wouldn't sign the gag order so I could talk about it.\n\nRight. Okay.\n\nI won't be gagged.\n\nSo second to that ... that's Hollywood.\n\nThat's Hollywood trouble. That's when your agents go, \"Oh, what were you thinking?\" But when you get the lawyers saying they've already opened an investigation ... I didn't have an opportunity to even clear my name or say it was a statement. And as you guys know, there's a long history of comedians doing this sort of thing. And I thought ... I didn't know that the shooter was going to give it to TMZ. I thought he was going to send it to Der Spiegel or Charlie Hebdo or something. Or a paper magazine. Once it's on TMZ, then it's on all their ancillary...\n\n... the woodchipper ...\n\n... the woodchipper, yeah.\n\n... the bots start working.\n\nThe bots start. And I didn't even know how that apparatus worked. So I was getting ... my timeline is, to this day, flooded with \"ISIS lady be bad.\" And I had to learn what bots were.\n\nAnd then there was this sort of debate over, no, no, you're just trying to make it better. These are real people. And then I started getting old-timey mail because a lot of Trump ... sacks of mail, like a cartoon. And there were all kinds of ...\n\n... those are real. Those aren't bots.\n\nThose are real people that really think I'm in ISIS. Because it's so believable. And they would say, once again, their favorite method is they would say, \"I want to shoot you in the cunt, cut your head off and then stuff your head up your cunt.\" And that was like the theme. And these are probably 70-year-old straight guys and stuff. Not exactly my demo. So they enjoy the old-timey mail. Some of them would do stickers. And a lot of them would draw me without a head and shit. So that went on.\n\nAnd then the FBI started calling me. And they have three levels of threats ...\n\nNow you're directed to the FBI because of threats.\n\nYep. I'm a big fan of the FBI, let me tell you. They protected me and they did a fantastic job. So they would call me if a threat was like - thank you. They're a government agency. Yes. I'm not anti-government. I'm not one of those at all. I think government is necessary and regulations are good.\n\nSo anyway, if you get a phone call ... If the lawyer gets a phone call, it's like kind of a threat. When they would call me personally, it was jacked up a little bit. And then, as I said in the tape on there, ironically, the day I filmed the movie, the FBI did a no-knock, which means they feel the threat is imminent. So I was sleeping in that day because I had a performance that night, and I was in my PJs. And every time the FBI comes over, they never laugh at this joke. I go \"Norm!\" Like on Cheers . \"Where everybody knows your name...\"\n\nAll right. So they came over and I was used to them saying \"look out for this or that.\" So they said that the MAGA bomber had ... he was already in custody. And they said that he had shared his list with like-minded people. And I said, \"Okay.\" And I said, \"Can you tell me how many?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"So you can't tell me who?' And they said, \"No.\"\n\nThen they suggested that I open my mailbox standing 10 feet away from it. Like the as-seen-on-TV old lady, but I would have to get two of them. So now I just stand in front of it and I go kaboom and I just open it myself.\n\nRight. Are you worried at all?\n\nYeah. I am. And on the other hand, it's been so much of a deluge. I had incidents at almost every show on the American leg of my tour.\n\nMeaning they'll get up and yell at you?\n\nOh, yeah. There was a GoFundMe for some guy that they flew into one of my Philadelphia shows - where I sold out the first one, had to add the double, hey. And he was like a QAnon guy or whatever. So he was in the second row and he starts yelling that I'm a pedophile.\n\nBy the way, you'll have to walk me through how the Trumpers then turned into calling Tom Hanks a pedophile and Sarah Silverman's a pedophile now. Not true.\n\nSo he started yelling that I was a pedophile. And then I got it down to a system where my tour manager and I have a security meeting personally with every gig that I do. And I really wanted to play what I call the great halls because I thought this material wouldn't work in 500-seaters. So here I played the Long Center, which is amazing. And in New York I played Radio City and Carnegie and sold out Carnegie in 24 hours. Very proud of that. I know, right? So I thought there is a story that people want to hear, there's just a disconnect. Which is, the fans were coming out, really, around the world. And so I'm now global if nothing else. Y'all know me.\n\nBut working ... your work in Hollywood has dried up.\n\nI don't have one single day of paid work ahead of me for the rest of my life.\n\nExcept for concerts. Except for ...\n\nI don't have any concerts coming up.\n\nRight. Because of this?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you can't get anyone to distribute this. You paid for this video that you've made?\n\nYes. Yeah. And honestly, the reason I even made it is at first I thought, even my lawyers were saying, you should document this story because it is historic and even if it sits on the shelf for 10 years or something like that. So, I wanted to just do that. And then, when no one from any of the TV or streaming services would even talk to me or ...\n\nNot Netflix, not Amazon?\n\nNone of them. No.\n\nNone of them. And what do they say to you?\n\nWhen it got to the check signers, and this is another important point, there's kind of a ... There's a couple of misleading things I want to clear up. One of them is women do have more power in show business, but to this day, there's not one female that can actually sign the check. So as powerful as Shonda Rhimes has, she still has to kick it up to the old white dinosaur to get a show greenlit. So there are still, I call them the six old white dinosaurs.\n\nOne of them used to be Leslie Moonves, but he's gone. Fuck him, all right. So, he raped his way out of the business. I have no sympathy. And they're all like that. They're all rapey and they're all gross and they're all behind the times and all that shit. So I would be trying to express, well, if the big boss doesn't want to give me the time of day, can you at least give him the stats from my tour? My tour grossed $4.4 million worldwide and I probably made about $75 million over my career.\n\nA friend of mine did a little experiment, which is he called the head of the one of the biggest free agencies in Hollywood and said, what if I could bring you ... No, his first question was, he said, \"Hey, would you like to take on Kathy Griffin?\" And this owner, who I've known for a million years, said, \"Oh, Kathy Griffin? That is a life's-too-short situation.\"\n\nSo, the same friend called the same agent a month later and said, \"What if I could bring you an actor I know, and this guy has made $75 million over his career?\" And the agent goes, \"I would call that a priority client.\" And my friend goes, \"Well, that guy is Kathy Griffin.\" And he still was like, \"Nope, nope, no, toxic, too scary.\" So, you know.\n\nSo what are you going to do? If you can't get at Amazon or Netflix or the more fast-forward ...\n\nWell, I'm hoping they'll come around and I'm hoping that whether it's the almighty dollar or they see possibilities or they see at least the historic value of the show. Although I try to make the show funny first, but there is ...\n\nIt's not all funny. There's some sad parts.\n\nIt's not all funny. Because some of that shit was really scary. And also, I feel a real need to tell people, when I was finally exonerated, I knew I could only do concerts overseas. So the cool thing is, I did really well overseas.\n\nYou're big in Belgium.\n\nThey didn't bat an eyelash. In fact, everywhere I went, and you guys know this if you've traveled, if it was a café or any place, pretty much they'd hear an American accent and be like, \"What the fuck are you guys doing? What's going on? You were the bastion of liberty.\" And so I would deal with that.\n\nBut the audiences were really hungry. And I think the fact that I know Trump sort of was like another layer. And the extent of the investigation and the extent to which they were willing to go to ... And I was obviously just a shiny object. I mean, my photo was days after Robert Mueller had been assigned. You guys have all seen it. When he's in trouble, there's some new shiny object that they'll dangle. And I was a shiny object. But this ...\n\nDo you regret doing the photo?\n\nI don't, because, No. 1, he really has it coming. He really deserves just ... he deserves what he has done to others. Probably most ... most of us probably agree that the most egregious thing is the zero tolerance kids in cages thing. But it's also moving the embassy to Jerusalem was stupid. Not to mention ... Right? I mean, that's just caused violence. There's just so many things that ...\n\nLike I said, at 58, I just thought, if you're not going to take a stand now, what the fuck you waiting for? I just wanted to get the story out there.\n\nAnd, by the way, they can take your phone and SIM card at airports in America. So that was a rumor that I also heard. So I was then put on the Interpol list. So I went overseas, my first show was in Auckland, New Zealand. And that was the first time I was detained. I was then detained at every single airport. Which is ...\n\nWhat do they do when they detain ...\n\nIt's actually really scary. They take your passport and they take your device, your phone, and they put you in a detention room, like The Breakfast Club , I guess. And I was Judd Nelson, apparently. And they don't tell you what they're doing. But their eyes would all turn into saucers.\n\nSo, to this day, I don't know what's on my passport. But it's bad. And then they call the supervisor and they take my passport and my phone and they go away. Sometimes it will be 20 minutes, sometimes I would be two hours. And you're just sitting there not knowing what's going to happen. What are you doing?\n\nI'm looking ... I'm going to read something that you wrote me. But go ahead.\n\nI thought you were bored and you're going to ...\n\nNo, I'm not bored.\n\n\"Mom, look, this is really going slowly. What are you making for dinner? Oh! Oh, I love pork chops.\"\n\nNo. I was going to ask you because I wanted ... it's sexist.\n\nOh, it's totally sexism. And ageism and misogyny.\n\nRight. One of the things you wrote. Would you mind if I read something that you texted me?\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAll right.\n\nI dare you.\n\nI asked you. Okay, well, dare me. You don't know me. I said, \"I have Amy Klobuchar right before you, so get ready for some comb talk,\" because we talked about the issues around the comb and her being a bad boss and stuff like that.\n\nYou wrote me, \"You know what? That whole thing is such Hillary Clinton-level bullshit. Big deal, she threw a binder at someone. I'd fire an assistant who brought me salad without utensils as well. Maybe that assistant would be happier working for Mark Meadows. Amy Klobuchar never pulled out her vagina in front of a worker or a subordinate, I can guarantee you that. Yashar Ali even started this nonsense campaign and got taken to the woodshed for it. But I'm saving all mine for Jack Dorsey. Fuck him and his place on the fucking spectrum. Love, your new best friend, Kathy Griffin.\"\n\nI speak freely. I speak freely.\n\nThere is so much to unpack there. Not the vagina part. But this sexism, the same thing with Amy Klobuchar. She was just talking about this, the idea that she's a bad boss and gets it 20 times more than other ...\n\nI mean, are you kidding? I don't care if she gives someone a concussion. That's nothing compared to Trump whipping his dick out and everybody else whipping their dicks out. Can you guys keep your dicks in for one second? Jesus Christ.\n\nAll right.\n\nI'm not going to let anybody see my vulva once. I know that's crazy. And I also think, knowing the Donald, he likes to be addressed as \"the Donald,\" which is the weird in itself.\n\nRight.\n\nHe's such an idiot. I think that he is the type of man that thinks and resents the audacity that I, at my age, would even dream of staying in the game. And my inner Joan Rivers, I want to basically die onstage and I don't ever really want to retire and I love what I do.\n\nAll right. Let's get to the ... I want to get to tech in just in a minute. But Anderson Cooper. Who didn't stand up for you and who did?\n\nAnderson Cooper did not.\n\nYes, I am aware of that.\n\nSo, yeah, everyone is. That one just really hurt because, I always say, I don't have a punchline for that. I mean, Zucker didn't surprise me because he's just a douchebag. He's not smart enough to run a news agency.\n\nThis is Jeff Zucker?\n\nJeff Zucker. Z-U-C-K-E-R. Although he wants it pronounced \"Zooker, like hooker.\" He said that to me once. \"It's Zooker like hooker.\" I was like, \"Okay. You got me.\"\n\nAnyway, even though I was exonerated, those two guys don't roll like that. It wouldn't be inside them, I don't think, to say, \"Oh it turns out this was kind of a smear campaign and we kind of know what this is.\" And there was a lot of manipulation of the image and all this stuff. And the Anderson thing hurt just because I really loved him as a friend and I ... nobody gave me a heads up or a call or anything like that.\n\nHave you spoken to him since?\n\nNo.\n\nNo? Not at all?\n\nBut did you see that shitfest New Years Eve? Oh. Woo-hoo-hoo, stinker! Oh my God. I watched every minute. I hate-watched it. It was a disaster! Oh, I was in heaven! Talk about chemistry.\n\nDid you think about reaching out to him again, or did you?\n\nYeah. He actually did send me one text that wasn't particularly nice. And I just wrote back. And honestly, I just said, is it okay if I reach out to your mom? Because I really was friendlier with his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt, or as I call her, Glo Vandy. You heard me. And he said yes. I just wrote her an email and I just said I appreciated her friendship. And I said, however you want to proceed is fine with me. I just really wanted to gush over her because she was a really good friend to me.\n\nDo you expect to ever have a discussion with him about that?\n\nHe's not like a talker. But ...\n\n... You have a new gay. You have Bobby from Sarasota.\n\nYeah. I got a ...\n\n... the civilian gays.\n\nThat's right. The civilian gays are on my side. I got ... A couple of days after the photo, one of the gays sent me a photo of all the gays dressed like me on Fire Island with mock heads doing a parade. And all the other gays were like, \"Hey, go girl, go.\" So I was like, oh. I almost cried. So emotional. I mean, that's ... I think that is my kinship with the LGBT community. I think we share a being on the outside looking in, liking to be subversive, having to fight harder for everything, jump higher, fight harder, that sort of thing. So I think that's kind of a natural relationship.\n\nI don't know what's going to happen. I can say none of the power gays have given me a gig or anything, but they might just be scared, too. I don't know. I'm blacklisted everywhere. So I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nSo, I want to talk about where your career's going to go last, but the tech people. You mentioned Jack Dorsey \"on the fucking spectrum.\" Talk about the tech companies. Because you have issues.\n\nWell, I do. Because I now have a little bit of understanding, but this is your area. But I was put into the beyond meme-o-sphere. I didn't know that these tech companies had agents ready. And I remember seeing that guy on 60 Minutes , Brad ...\n\nParscale.\n\nParscale. That fucker is dirty. All right? He should be in front of the grand jury. Oh, by the way, I want to be on that grand jury.\n\nOkay. I'm in charge of the grand jury. But go ahead.\n\nYou are? I was hoping?\n\nNo, no.\n\nMaybe if somebody gets sick or something. I would do it in a heartbeat.\n\nYeah. It's me and Giuliani. But go ahead.\n\nOh. So anyway, as I was taking such an online beatdown, I was also learning at the same time, some of the non-robots coming over me, like I said, I had to educate myself about all these Trumpers and the subgroups and the rise of Nazism among young people. Because I'm from Oak Park, Illinois, and it was this really big deal. I don't know if you guys remember the Nazis ...\n\nYes, the Nazis.\n\nWhen the Nazis marched in Skokie. And it was like a civic event. The whole city talked about it for years and people protested. And they never came back. So it blows my ... It makes me really sad that there's now a whole new generation getting misinformation that turns them into full-blown Nazis. And they don't care for me.\n\nAnd so you've got the Breitbart folks and tied in with that group, and I did not know that some of them have large social media presences and that their followers have no interest in legit news at all. So, that's why ...\n\nWhat do these companies do? What do you want Jack Dorsey to do?\n\nWell, first of all, he should resign. The first order of business, he needs to resign. Because I got fucked into ... remember when he was covering Ferguson? I remember thinking, he's like this forward-thinking guy and he's going to document the riots in Ferguson, and that's good for him. Next thing you know, he's not banning any of these Nazis or super-far-right QAnon folks and stuff. I don't believe they don't have the capability. But you could answer that question. Is it really, truly out of their hands?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, what the fuck?\n\nYeah. What the fuck?\n\nAre you going to call him?\n\nI can. But not right now.\n\nLet's call him and on speaker.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nCome on! (cheering)\n\nNo.\n\nGet that stick out of your ass! Let's have a little fun.\n\nNo. N-O.\n\nHe would take my call.\n\nYeah, okay. You do. You call people.\n\nI do. I called Marty Singer. He's one of the attorneys that would go after the #MeToo victims and threaten them. I also called one of the Nazis from Charlottesville, the crying one, Chris Cartwell. And I was like, \"Hey, it's Kathy Griffin, bitch. How does it feel now, mother fucker?\" And just hang up. By the way, it's very smart of me to identify myself. He's out of jail now. Shit. I didn't think of that part.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut the thing with the social media thing is, I thought Sheryl Sandberg was a hero with the Lean In and ... Although let me just say about Lean In , every time I've tried to lean in, I broke my fucking nose. So, she should have written a sequel. But anyway, I don't know what their game is, because how much money do you need? And if they were taking rubles, etc., and you can tell me, but I would suspect it's more than just Russians?\n\nRight. It's Chinese. It's all of them.\n\n... and maybe some Americans. But that is something that I fear. Because I don't see them making any moves and their testimony in front of the Senate was just really embarrassing for the Senate because they didn't know an iPhone from Google. For real. Gohmert. I don't see them signaling anything that they want to protect their users.\n\nI think ... Two things I always say is, they want all of the benefits but none of the responsibilities of running the platform.\n\nI am a living example of that.\n\nThey did not contact you when you started getting strafed on social media?\n\nNot at all. Not at all.\n\nThey never escalated you to a VIP kind of status?\n\nI don't even know what that means. I have a blue check?\n\nThey should have contacted you if you'd gotten - if you'd reported death ... you just filled in like everybody else, the death threats?\n\nYes. I fill in the thing and I send it.\n\nNo.\n\nOh, is it true ... I want to ask you this. Is it true that the way, I think it's a robot, I heard a rumor that if you follow them for a minute and then block them, it kills the mother bot. Is that true?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nOh, shit. Kara, I thought you had some bot-killing trick.\n\nNo. I don't have a bot-killing trick. But they didn't contact you when you ...\n\nNo one contacted me. No one but the FBI.\n\nNobody but the FBI?\n\nNo.\n\nNone of the social media companies. What should happen to them? Should they be subject to regulation?\n\nYeah. Well, first of all, we have to get more people in elected positions that know what social media is, that know how it works.\n\nYeah. Right.\n\nYeah. They don't know the questions to ask and I thought Zuckerberg's testimony was frightening. I mean, seriously. Those beady eyes, I know it's a joke. That's not human. So I don't necessarily think he's real.\n\nHe is.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nHe is.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you seen blood? Or is it ice?\n\nI've seen it.\n\nAll right. Remember one summer when he annoyed a bunch of people and went to their house for dinner and thought it was a big treat for them? Can you imagine? Knock knock. \"It's me, Jeff Zuckerberg.\" Okay.\n\nMark Zuckerberg.\n\nOh, sorry. Mark. I'm thinking of Jeff Zucker. I have residual anger for ... But I wouldn't even let him in. I'd be like, \"Get the fuck out, you fucking cheater.\" Because I actually think they are as complicit or, rather, responsible for manipulating worldwide elections. I mean, worldwide.\n\nSo the idea that Nazism is on the rise in Germany where, as you know, it was ... the only European country I know of where it was at least technically illegal. And Poland is now an autocracy. And even Italy is getting kleptocracy. So I blame them for all of that.\n\nI was in London a month ago where I gave a speech on the First Amendment at Oxford University. Oh, fuck off. You guys are like this, \"Went there. Yawn. Yawn.\" I didn't even go to college! That's a big deal for me. I went to...\n\nEverybody! Oxford!\n\nNow you're talking down to me. So anyway, one of the reasons I am here is, obviously, I was the first of many. But if they're stripping John Brennan of his fucking security clearance, they will stop at nothing. And my story is unique in that I did and do have the means to defend myself. But I've also met many, many people, as you know, this inaugural had more protesters actually arrested and put in jail than any other inaugural. So those folks got to show up for a trial. They've got to pay for, hopefully, legal fees because you need a lawyer in those situations.\n\nSo that's one of the reasons I want to get the message out, it really is not a showbiz story. It's all fields. And that's why I also think the ageism and sexism, misogyny tie in. I think the more younger electeds we get that can talk about unionizing indigenous women, women that are forgotten, women that have been incarcerated, getting people who have been incarcerated the right to vote when they get out, stuff like that.\n\nI don't even understand how stuff trends on Twitter. Is that manipulated? Or are those actually the top 20 things people are talking about?\n\nWell, they can push things. If they push virality, speed, and engagement, that's what they're going to get.\n\nOkay, so how does that work? Let's say that they want #MuteHillary. That's got to be some fucking group, right?\n\nWell, you can manipulate those algorithms.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nYou can use ... These are very sophisticated ...\n\nDo I have to buy an algorithm? What is that?\n\nNo. You don't have to buy an algorithm. But they're very manipulable. They don't want to take responsibility for what goes on in their process.\n\nHere's what I want to know what they have the nerve to say to you because you actually know how this shit works.\n\nRight. They tell me they're not, that it's really hard after having previous ...\n\nWait a minute. I just got an idea.\n\nWhat?\n\nLet's role play.\n\nAll right. And then we have questions.\n\nYou're going to play Kara Swisher, okay. I'm going to play Jack Dorsey. Are you ready?\n\nI just was online with him, we just did an online thing.\n\n\"Hey, I just came from a Nazi rally, how are you?\" I'm embellishing. I'm an artist. \"What's your question, you fucking dyke bitch?\" I'm playing character, I'm playing a character. \"How do you like my beard, I'm in ZZ Top.\" And then what?\n\nI would not know what to say.\n\nBut you really call these fools on the carpet.\n\nI do.\n\nDo they actually try to convince even you ...\n\nYes.\n\n... like, \"Oh, we didn't see this coming.\"\n\n\"We're trying, we didn't see this coming. We're trying really hard. Kara, don't be so mean to us.\"\n\nOh my God! Let's go through together.\n\nOkay.\n\nBecause I will kick some fucking ass on your behalf.\n\nAll right, okay. We're going to have some questions from the audience via Slido. Let's see: \"What are your general thoughts on the 2020 elections and current candidates, Kathy?\"\n\nI think that the thing that's great is that, I'm obviously a Democrat, and I think the thing that's great is, I think we have an amazing stable. And I think what's fucked up is that already social media is contributing to the right-wing notion that we have a bunch of horrible choices. And I think we have an embarrassment of riches. I personally would like to see a smart, competent female president before I die, so that's where I'm coming from. But what the good news is, I think there's many, many stars in there, many stars.\n\nAny particular favorite?\n\nI have a little hard-on for Booker/Harris, Harris/Booker, and I don't care who's who. Don't boo Cory Booker, he's a good guy. I had lunch with him.\n\nOkay, you had lunch with ... Is there a ...\n\nI feel like Booker gets a hard time.\n\nHe does.\n\nWhy? Oh, he took corporate money for two months?\n\nI don't know.\n\nGrow up!\n\nOkay. \"Is there a problem with hate speech in the US? Should it be regulated as it is in many other democratic countries?\"\n\nHonestly, I think it should be regulated on social media first. I actually think they should be the pioneers because, as you know, in anonymity, it's very different than if you yell \"fire\" in a theater, which is breaking the First Amendment. What I did is not breaking the First Amendment.\n\nDo you believe in some regulation on social media?\n\nOn social media first and, frankly, I would like to see how it works there before you impose it on people. And being a comedian, we live in fear of free speech being limited in any way, and journalists of course. I want to have them try it online first.\n\nI would like them to first get rid of bots, which they can do. The bots do gin up, you saw during the Samantha Bee/Roseanne Barr thing.\n\nYes.\n\nIt was really interesting. The bots don't care what side, they just want to create discord. They were doing the, \"Rosanne is terrible,\" and they were doing, \"Sam Bee is terrible,\" and then humans join in.\n\nHow come Americans don't get their goal? It's so transparent.\n\nWell, I think a lot of people, a very well-known reporter I know was ...\n\nWho?\n\nI'm not telling you.\n\nBret Stephens?\n\nYeah, Bret Stephens.\n\nI knew it. I don't trust Bret Stephens as far as I can throw him.\n\nIt's not Bret Stephens, but anyway.\n\nWho? Charlie Sykes?\n\nNo, I'm not telling you, it's not.\n\nOh, not David Frum. You're not believing his bullshit. \"Axis of evil,\" remember that shit? David Frum.\n\nIn any case, they were arguing with a bot and I had to text them and say, \"Hey, that's a bot you're arguing with.\"\n\nYou're a good friend.\n\nI know.\n\nThat's a call I'd like to get.\n\nI know, I will.\n\nArgue with a bot and...\n\nLet's get to: \"Kathy, are you single?\"\n\nI am single. And I've got to say, my boyfriend was a rockstar during the whole thing. And it sucks, we just broke up four months ago.\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know why. All I can say is a relationship works until it didn't. But he was a great guy and what's ironic is I referred to him quite a bit in the film because he was with me for so many things.\n\nRight, so you are single?\n\nFifty-eight. And are there any like 50-year-old, I want like a 50-year-old attorney, CPA. I want a real job, not you fucking venture capitalists with your apps. I want a dental plan.\n\nYeah, okay.\n\nI want a defined benefit plan, not bitcoin. What's the matter with these people, bitcoin. Can you imagine? Bitcoin.\n\nSo you're looking for a man.\n\nThey believed it?\n\nYou're looking for a man.\n\nI'm waiting for a man to be lucky enough to find me.\n\nAll right, okay, good. Well said. You said backstage, you're close to being fluid, right?\n\nIf it would help my career, I'd turn fluid in a heartbeat, binary fluid, oh, and bipolar is very trendy. Yes, that's my announcement, I'm bipolar and fluid.\n\nOkay, well, you're going to come to our lesbian parties now.\n\nI wouldn't miss a lesbian party!\n\nAll right, okay, all right. They'll stick by you. You can join our Militia Etheridge.\n\nI was hoping.\n\nOkay: \"Have you been able to persuade anyone from the other side's opinion by sharing your story? Should we engage with racists, misogynists, etc.?\"\n\nNo, not at all. Not at all. I have a ton of relatives that don't talk to me. I will say that my ex's parents are big Trumpers and they had news vans outside their house because his dad and he have the same name, so that didn't help.\n\nBut I will say - this is the only funny story - but the amount of people that legit think I'm in ISIS to this day is sort of funny now, but it's also shocking. But that day, my mom, my beloved mother, who I'm sorry to say is now in the throes of dementia, but I'm sure you know her and she was a national treasure.\n\nAnd she watches Fox, like my mom.\n\nShe watches ... what the fuck, right?\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nDo you ever yell at her?\n\nAll the time.\n\nRight, me too. I was like, \"I don't care how sick you are, turn it off.\" All right, so I'm a very good nurse. I'm a very good nurse. Anyway, my Mom that day calls me and it's a crazy day and I'm crying and all sorts of stuff. And she calls me and she was watching Fox, but her hearing aids weren't in because they would have hid the petals in her hair, it's an old-person thing. And her vision was really going.\n\nShe goes, \"I was watching my boyfriend, Sean Hannity, and he says you joined Al-Qaeda, and out of all the clubs you could have joined, dod damn it, why did you join Al-Qaeda?\" So my own mother thought I had joined Al-Qaeda, as she says it, and then wanted me to take up stamp collecting or a normal hobby. It took like a good week to talk my own mother out of the fact that I'm not in ISIS.\n\n\"Kara, how does this career hit that Kathy endured impact the world of tech? What are the similarities between this and the Bezos thing?\"\n\nI think Bezos managed to hit back pretty hard himself. He did, he wasn't putting up ... he is the world's richest man so he does have assets, so to speak, to do that, right?\n\nYeah. He actually inspired me because I actually wrote a thread. I have a next-door neighbor that I'm in a civil suit with and he's a Trumper and he stands at the wall, we have a shared wall.\n\nThat's where the Kardashians used to live?\n\nNo, the other side. The Kardashians were a dream. I swear to God, I know that's hard to believe.\n\nThey were neighbors.\n\nBut they were my next-door neighbors during this whole thing, which I hope if you see the film ... the stories that got cut - can I tell one story that ...\n\nAll right, hurry quickly, we only have time for one question.\n\nAll right, so get this. Kim is dumb as a box of rocks, but she's super sweet, like really sweet. One day I called her and I said, \"My mom's really depressed, can you send the kids over?\" And she did, and it was really sweet and stuff.\n\nSo the husband's crazy, I call him Pabs because he thinks he's Pablo Picasso and he writes \"Pablo\" on all his designer clothes. So anyway, he went on one of those 5150 cycles, which I'm this close to doing. That's when you go to the nut bin and just rest. He came back and I never heard from Pabs, he's not a talker. My then-boyfriend runs into the kitchen and he goes, \"Holy shit, you're not going to believe what Kanye just did.\"\n\nWell, who wouldn't react to that? So I go, \"What?\" So Pabs comes home and of course I'm not going to bother him, it's a serious day. He goes in the backyard and he goes, \"AAAAHHHH,\" like that. Loud, and then, like at level 10, he blares up fucking Enya, \"Far and away, far and away, far and away, AAAAHHHH. Far and away, AAAAHHHH, far and away, far and away.\" I can't not tell you that, that's why we need the First Amendment!\n\nAnd your other neighbor?\n\nOh, the other neighbor stands at the wall and he calls me a cunt and a bitch and, \"Oh, Trump put the heat on you, you bald dyke,\" because I had shaved my head in solidarity with my sister who had passed away from cancer two days prior to the incident. Anyway, so I wrote a thread about it and I ran it by all my very expensive lawyers and I really was inspired by the Bezos media thing. I just thought, he's a CEO of a very powerful company called KB Home and I thought, \"Boy, I thought those ...\" And his name is Jeffrey T. Mezger. Anyway, that's all covered. It's all covered.\n\nSo I thought, you know, I have so many friends that have been so much braver than I in the #MeToo and Time's Up movement, that I thought, \"Well, what am I being quiet for because this guy's so ... \" I'm about putting it out there.\n\nOkay, all right, okay. So we just had this one.\n\n\"How do you spend your future days after this career hit? The documentary sounds brilliant\" - and it is, by the way - \"but will take time. Should you go to Greece and open a club?\" I guess, like Lindsay Lohan.\n\nWell, naturally I would have Lindsay be the CFO because she is someone you can count on, and the little dancing. I spend my days working and producing and writing and pitching. I have had more meetings and I have met with every network and streaming service. I actually, like I can't believe I'm here. This is the only \"yes\" I've gotten in the year. So thank you, thank you.\n\nYou know, several dudes didn't want to interview you, but I was just good with it, I was so good with it. Anyway, next question. \"How do you feel about Meghan McCain?\"\n\nOh, you know. She's all right.\n\nShe's all right? Okay.\n\nYou know, I don't dislike her. I don't like when she goes off, \"Do you really want to be Venezuela?!\" Like, \"Okay, girl, calm down.\" She does those Fox buzzwords.\n\nOkay, all right. \"First, thank you. Question: What's the advice you give a young woman entering the workforce today?\"\n\nI give advice that is probably not welcome, but it's real. I say, first of all, in comedy in particular, don't do it unless you love it because you're going to bomb more than you do well and if you don't have a burning desire to do it, it's probably not your thing, if you're just using it as a stepping stone.\n\nBut what I also tell young women, especially women of color is, I just am honest. I'll just say, \"You're not going to get equal pay.\" These chicks that get 87 cents on the dollar, God love them. I get like a nickel on the dollar and it's been like that my whole life. I just tell them, \"You're going to have to work harder and jump higher, and you're going to have to watch the guys get paid more and they may be better, the same or lesser than you in their work capacity.\"\n\nI just think it's better to be honest about that because I'm chairman of the new Time's Not Up Yet campaign. I think Time's Up is great, but I think frankly, under this administration, it's struggling because it's hard to get movement when you've got these two movements happening, MeToo and Time's Up and then you've got this whole umbrella of complete sexism and Don Jr. like making fun of MeToo, etc.\n\nI just say, \"Know that you've got to work harder and get in there and dig in and do whatever it takes,\" and it's a lot of figuring out. Like, for me, I can't get in the front door, so I figure out a way to get in the side window.\n\nBut I would also say, educate yourself. I took over my own promotion and my tour business because the white boys at Live Nation weren't happy when I said, \"I'd like to start promoting my own shows.\" They said, \"You think you're a better promoter than us?\" I said, \"No, you have to accept that picture overnight made me a totally different type of artist. I can no longer play the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, where I used to just go and make fun of the housewives.\" The last tour had a specific message and they would put me in banner ads with Toby Keith. So I hired a DC marketing company. I started my first mailing list at the ripe age of 57, and text list. And that's really what sold out the tour. I then started ...\n\nYou are a different kind of artist now. You're not ...\n\nI'm Hanoi Jane . In the way that Hanoi Jane, that photo, is with Jane to this day, I am very cognizant that that photo will be with me.\n\nAnd your topics will change, right? Because you didn't talk about politics, you talked about housewives and- ...\n\nYeah, some guy I was banging, or whatever.\n\nRight. But you can't do that now?\n\nWell, I'm not banging anybody.\n\nOkay. Last two questions, we only have a few seconds.\n\nYet! It's early in the day.\n\nLet's see, which one, we have just one more left: \"Have you considered crowdfunding the release of your movie?\" If you can get into that very quickly, we'll do one more.\n\nCrowdfunding?\n\nCrowdfunding.\n\nNo, because I have enough money and I don't want hardworking people to give their money, you know what I mean? I also did a lot of charity stuff, like I did the tie-in with Trevor Project and American Cancer Society and Time's Up. So I would do shows where ticket sales went to those events as well. I'm actually going to start a run in LA at the Laugh Factory, which is really how I got my first big break.\n\nAnd even though I said I would never do clubs again, I'm going to do, there's five Mondays in April, and it's literally just going to be a new hour every week. The show is called Kathy Griffin, A New Hour Every Week because, if nothing else, I'm prolific. So maybe that will make the industry people go, \"Oh, she's not like these guy comics that need like two years to come up with 20 minutes.\"\n\nRight, last question here.\n\nAnd I'm doing it for free, pro bono.\n\nAll right. We really have just one second to finish.\n\nDon't yell at me.\n\nI won't yell at you. I'm not yelling at you. I'm speaking in a quiet voice.\n\nCan we call Dorsey just real quick?\n\nNo. One of the things ... I'm going to finish, one of the things in this movie, which I think is also very ... there's sad parts of it. You can feel a sadness in it. And I want you to just comment on this and then we can get going and go to our parties and finding you a date.\n\nOkay. At the lesbian party?\n\nAt the lesbian party. There's some very attractive lesbians.\n\nI'm pro lesbian. Pro, okay.\n\nWhen you said in the movie, \"I'm the girl who never learned a lesson.\"\n\nYes, \"I'm Kathy Griffin and I never learned my lesson.\"\n\nWhat does that mean? Should you learn your lesson?\n\nNo. And I'll tell you why. All the things that I've done that a bunch of old white guys told me I shouldn't have done, are the things that made me successful. That's why I proudly say, I bought my house, $10.5 million cash, because I'm friends with Suze Orman and Suze says, \"Girlfriend, if you can't pay cash, that means you can't afford it! Denied!\"\n\nShe's a lesbian, lesbian?\n\nThe ultimate, President Orman 2020, that's my dream.\n\nAll right.\n\nBut also, I just think it's important that women come out of the shadows about money and talk about how much they make because that's how you'll know what your market value is. You can't just believe the guy who's telling you.\n\nLast question, do you regret any of this?\n\nNo. It's still, should I have to deal with, like when I went to England there was a driver dude that took me from London Heathrow to the hotel. And he said he was Moroccan and that if we were in Morocco, he would cut my tongue off. This is a month ago. Of course, I thought I could talk him out of it and I said, \"Are you aware that President Trump called all of Africa shithole countries?\" He said, \"I don't believe it, he's the greatest president in the history of America.\" So that's what you're dealing with. I assume he gets his information from social media. I'm assuming that. Yeah, it was just all about ... that's my new normal. Trying to get to a hotel before this guy cuts my tongue out.\n\nOh, wow, that's a bummer, Kathy. Do you have a joke to tell?\n\nI do have a joke because, No. 1, I filmed it and then I was in such a rage because the company was CLS Empire and I called the vice president and he was really cool about it and fired the guy and all this stuff. I said, \"I am not going to be able to live with myself if I read a month from now some woman got her fucking tongue cut out.\" I filmed me reading him the riot act. It's a really fancy hotel and I'm screaming at him, \"Oh, yeah, say it again, say you want to cut my tongue off. If you can get there first, if we don't cut your dick off first, so it's going to be a fucking horse race.\" Admittedly, I look very ready for a 5150, but I'm glad I did it.\n\nKathy Griffin, everybody.\n\nKara Swisher, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Recode.net.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow the company's transition to for-profit will affect everyone.\n\nWhy you need a battery-powered house.\n\nComputing has a big energy appetite.

      "text": "Kathy Griffin says Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey should resign and she wouldn't let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg into her house\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"I actually think they are as complicit or, rather, responsible for manipulating worldwide elections. I mean, worldwide.\"\n\nby Eric Johnson\n\nIf you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\n\nAs the result of a now-infamous photoshoot in 2017, in which she held up a Halloween mask that resembled a beheaded Donald Trump, Kathy Griffin's life has changed forever. In addition to destroying job prospects and alienating her from longtime TV pal Anderson Cooper, the controversy has also forced Griffin to learn a lot about bots and coordinated harassment campaigns on social media.\n\n\"I had to educate myself about all these Trumpers and the subgroups and the rise of Nazism among young people,\" Griffin said on the latest episode of Recode Decode . \"Because I'm from Oak Park, Illinois, and it was this really big deal ... when the Nazis marched in Skokie .\"\n\nGriffin told Recode's Kara Swisher that while she was being threatened by people who ostensibly supported President Trump (\"Their favorite method is, they would say, 'I want to shoot you in the cunt, cut your head off and then stuff your head up your cunt,'\" she recalled) she was not contacted by anyone from Twitter's safety team.\n\n\"He should resign,\" Griffin said of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. \"The first order of business, he needs to resign ... Remember when he was covering Ferguson? I remember thinking, he's like this forward-thinking guy and he's going to document the riots in Ferguson, and that's good for him. Next thing you know, he's not banning any of these Nazis or super-far-right QAnon folks and stuff. I don't believe they don't have the capability.\"\n\nMore generally, she said social media companies are \"complicit\" in fraudulent elections around the world and said that if CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to join her for dinner - as he did with families around America in 2017 - she'd say, \"Get the fuck out, you fucking cheater.\n\n\"First of all, we have to get more people in elected positions that know what social media is, that know how it works,\" Griffin said. \"They don't know the questions to ask and I thought Zuckerberg's testimony was frightening.\"\n\nYou can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Google Podcasts , Pocket Casts , and Overcast .\n\nBelow, we've shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara's conversation with Kathy.\n\nKathy Griffin: Woo! Kara Swisher - Your headliner, Kara Swisher, is here.\n\nSit down, sit down.\n\nAll right, I just started with my funnies.\n\nAll right, listen, we have a lot to talk about. We were just talking about ...\n\nNo shit.\n\nNo shit. I don't know where to begin. Why don't you explain the photo? Just talk about the photo.\n\nOkay. So one of the things that I'm very open about is I'm 58 years and proud of it, 58, look at this body! Look at me! I'm a role model. All right so, I've been canned from Bravo because of the piece of shit Andy Cohen with his no talent.\n\nRight.\n\nNo, if you could name a skill set, I'm all ears.\n\nAll right, okay.\n\nI thought so. But I've been dealing with ageism in my industry for a long time. And since I was about 40, they've been trying to put me out to pasture. I don't have a big Lorne Michaels type or a Judd Apatow type to have my back or a studio or anything. Sometimes when you're out of work, you'll do little silly things like that. I've done it before. I'll just take some wacky pictures, put them up on my social media and try to make you guys laugh. That day I worked with a shooter named Tyler Shields and he had taken some other photos of me before that were good. He's a good shooter. But I'm a little pissed at him because he won't give me the copyright and that picture changed my life irrevocably.\n\nBut he came over, just him and a couple of bros. The very last photo, we had taken a bunch of silly ones which never saw the light of day and the very last photo, we did collaborate and say, \"Let's do a photo that shames Trump in some way.\" And I did it in response to, even though I can't stand Megyn Kelly, but I also didn't like when Trump said \"there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\" So the inspiration was as deep as this, \"see if you can can handle it.\"\n\nI just thought, all right, let's see how he likes it when there's blood coming out of his wherever. And so it was a Halloween mask and it was one of my styrofoam wig heads. Because the mask kept folding, like his balls I assume. Oh, they're dragging on the floor, he trips on them every morning. But anyway, sorry, we'll stay on topic.\n\nAll right. Thank you for that vision though, go ahead.\n\nGod, poor Stormy, can you imagine?\n\nYeah, okay.\n\nWhat she's seen. Anyway, so took the photo to be like subversive, I'd say, more than funny. Look, if people think it's a joke and it makes them laugh, that's fine. But I kinda felt like it was a little more of a, just like a middle finger.\n\nRight, yep.\n\nWhat happened was, took the photo and I was so naïve that the photographer for some reason gave it to TMZ. So if you guys don't know this, TMZ is a guilty pleasure blog, run by a self-loathing gay man named Harvey Levin. And his big gig is that he has a fucking vault and everybody in Hollywood is scared of his vault. Well, I say open the fucking vault, all right, I got nothing to hide. So I'm not afraid of those guys anymore, but I will say in my business, people think that TMZ is the news. They pretty much think it's the Post. The Washington one, all right? Denver Post. But anyway, it started with the photo and I believe the title was ...\n\nDid you think at all there was any possibility because of the headless ...\n\nNot for a minute. I thought, this will be on a gay blog for two days. I really thought, I was clearly ... I actually purposely did a stoic look on my face because normally I'm very animated. I purposely wore this high collar thing. And I was holding up a Halloween mask. By the way, if it had been a full body dummy, that probably would have been fine.\n\nSo then Harvey Levin was started with the, \"Kathy Griffin has joined ISIS and severed the president's head.\" Which, I'm not a surgeon but I don't think that's feasible. That he would then go back to work. \"Work.\" So it spread like wildfire and I love that whole AMI flipping. So then all those other publications picked it up very, very rapidly.\n\nBut you were in ISIS, that you were in ISIS. But it was a lark, this was ... You didn't think possibly tasteless, you weren't worried that he was actually president and there had been threats and things like that.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then there were the Al Qaeda beheadings or anything like that. You weren't ...\n\nNo, but I will tell you I did a tragic apology video, which I still kept up. Because my good pal, Rosie O'Donnell, who is the preeminent expert at being trolled by Donald Trump, he's been after her for, what, 13 years. And she called me and she said, \"What if Daniel Pearl's mother saw this?\" And that's why I did the apology video. When then all my comedian friends called me and they said, \"Why did you apologize?\"\n\nI just want to be clear, everyone turned on me, left, right, and center. The right wing had a field day and they still are. That photo's in the new NRA ad, it's in the new National GOP ad, it was in several local GOP races during the midterms.\n\nIt's been manipulated, it shows up at every rally. People make a lot of more Trumps holding my head, stuff like that. So in the way that it went more than viral is not something I could have seen because I wasn't aware they had that apparatus ready to go. Trump's calling ...\n\nYou called it a wood chipper.\n\nI call it the wood chipper because it's really no different than what they did to Little Marco and Lyin' Ted and stuff. I was sort of the first celebrity. The reason I ...\n\nWell, Rosie O'Donnell, right? The names.\n\nYes, but she didn't have to go under federal investigation by two federal agencies. So what happened was the next day I got a call from my attorney and he said the Secret Service has opened a file on you, and the U.S. Attorney's office. The part that I want to tell people, because I want people to know their rights and there's a lot of mythology about what they can and can't do. But they wanted me to go downtown to the jail downtown in a jumpsuit and cuffs and they wanted video of a perp walk. Over my dead body would that happen.\n\nBecause by the way, I did show that photo to my lawyers before I posted it. I'm not stupid, I work in the First Amendment, it's my commodity. And my lawyers - rightly so - said, \"Yeah, it's well within the bounds of the First Amendment.\" So A) I didn't break the law, B) I didn't violate the First Amendment.\n\nSo I didn't know what they had in mind, but the investigation, I think, was to intimidate me. And my entire tour, the rest of my tour was canceled within 12 hours. And TMZ was reporting the tour cancellations in real time, which was odd. And then I just became toxic and everybody became scared of me and stuff like that.\n\nSo you had checked with your lawyers that this was okay to publish.\n\nYeah, I sent it to him and I said, \"Can I post this?\" And he said, \"Yes.\"\n\nDid any time you think that it was tasteless or something like that, just because he's the president, whatever you think of him as the president?\n\nNo, because it's him.\n\nRight.\n\nThe reason I did something so extreme with him ... First of all, I've known this moron for 25 years. One time he hired me to roast him. So he acts like he doesn't know my shtick, he does.\n\nOkay. What did you say at the time, during that roast?\n\nOh, well first of all, like a typical bully, when I saw him at that fakakta golf course that we're all paying for, Bedminster, whatever it's called, and the only reason I did it is because Liza was gonna sing. And you can't leave Liza alone with Donald Trump, I mean, even you know that, Kara. It's not safe. And she was on her happy pills that day, so I just wanted to keep an eye on her. And so when Trump approached me like every other bully, he had hired me to roast him and comes toward me with the fucking gut hanging out and his balls are filling his pleats. He's so gross.\n\nAnyway, he comes up and he's like, \"Uh-oh, there she is, don't make any jokes about the hair.\" So of course, I made as many jokes as I could - but I did touch his hair, though, that day. And he didn't feel it, which I thought was incredible. I touched it and he had no reaction to it. So I did it a second time, and he still didn't even feel it. So it's like a shellacked sculpture: Billy Ray Cyrus meets combover.\n\nBelieve it or not, when I knew him during the NBC days, I don't mean to defend Hollywood but honestly, nobody took him seriously. I mean, I would see him just on roundabouts, if I was promoting My Life on the D-List or one of the specials and he'd be doing The Apprentice . Or I'd see around New York in some way and he would show up at the opening of an envelope. There was an envelope opening one time. I actually spent quite a bit of time with him.\n\nOne time, there was a roast for Larry King, it was like his 120th birthday party, I think. And so there was a dais and as you know, the weirdest thing about a dais is the audience is watching you eat dinner prior to the little roasts. And I was in between the Donald and Gilbert Gottfried, I have never been more in love with Gilbert in my life. Because Trump just, it was just that like wah, wah, wah, the Charlie Brown teacher, and he kept saying non-sequentorial shit that made no sense. And I knew he was stupid, but I didn't know he was Britney Spears stupid. Like happy to be stupid. Oh Britney's like fine with it.\n\nAnd so the reason I wanted to do something really dramatic with the photo is truly, I remember watching every day of the Watergate hearings and I truly never thought in my lifetime anything like this could happen. And now I believe it's worse.\n\nAll right, so you put the photo out ...\n\nI said to the photographer, I didn't have a publicist ...\n\nBut there one other thought, because at one point Hillary Clinton decided it was Perseus and Medusa.\n\nThat hurt. So Hillary Clinton, who I worship, she puts in her audiobook, she goes, \"And all the fuss about Kathy Griffin, it was obviously a send-up of Perseus and Medusa.\" Which I've never heard of. I just need you guys to back me up when in the other interviews, I go, \"It was a send-up of Perseus and Medusa.\" Is that like a Greek story?\n\nYes.\n\nSounds Greek. Does somebody's head get cut off?\n\nMedusa's, yes.\n\nShe's a woman.\n\nYes.\n\nOh, it would have been a send-up. I get it now, I'm the woman.\n\nYes, got it. She had snakes on her hair.\n\nI have curly hair.\n\nIf you put her face in front of people, they turn to stone. You don't ... Okay, all right.\n\nThere's a lot of people I'd like to turn to stone. But ...\n\nSo in the 24 hours, the idea was that you were inciting violence, suggesting assassination.\n\nYes.\n\nIn 24 hours, suddenly all the virality went into it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo you were canceled by the internet, essentially.\n\nYeah, and also everybody felt the need to make a grand statement. So CNN was first in line. And then actually on the ticker it said, \"CNN fires ISIS member Kathy Griffin from the New Year's Eve broadcast.\"\n\nSo just to be clear, you're not a member of ISIS, right?\n\nI worked at the gift shop for a week. First of all, they get up too early. They're on those jungle bars at 6:00 am. That is not my gig. By the way, it's taken me a long time to even be able to make that joke because I've had so many people confront me on the street and they're convinced I'm in ISIS. And they're tying me in with pedophiles and something, QAnon?\n\nQAnon.\n\nYeah, okay, am I Q? Are you Q?\n\nNo.\n\nWho's Q?\n\nSomeone.\n\nAll right, there's not really a Q, right?\n\nI don't even want to go into it.\n\nOkay. But that's my role now, I have to know all this shit. I had to learn all the Nazis, now I know all the fucking Nazis, the Proud Boys, they all come at me. And some guy named Charlie Kirk, who's got fans that are like cult members. And they don't play.\n\nSo online, the death threats were immediate. But then because ...\n\nThe death threats range from ...\n\nThey range from, well, the most popular one was, we want to cut your head off, we want to stuff it up your pussy and then cut you in the middle. That was their most popular way of wanting to kill me. And it was graphic. So the way the tour got canceled was, people started calling these theaters, and I really don't blame the theater owners.\n\nAnd putting death threats in ...\n\nBecause when you're normally doing Mamma Mia or Blue Man Group , you're not used to someone saying, \"I don't want to go see this ISIS member do comedy.\" So I later found out that they were all robocalls, which was devastating to me.\n\nSo when I talk about the Trump woodchipper, I've just learned so much. I have a weird feeling I might show up in some of that David Pecker stuff. Because now that AMI has OK and Life and Style, I wouldn't be surprised if there was an email from Don Jr. saying ... Don Jr. said on Good Morning America , \"Our family just doesn't want to ruin Kathy Griffin's career, we want to decimate her.\" And he's Eddie Munster from the show The Munsters .\n\nI have a lot of respect for him and his girlfriend. So the reason I tell the story is, it is in fact historic. So I did a lot of research on this because I didn't want to be spouting off, but I am actually the first person that has had a sitting United States president use the full power of the Oval, the first family, the Department of Justice, and the entire right-wing media to try to ruin a private citizen. And I happen to think being a 58-year-old female comedian with a big mouth and everything antithetical to what he believes in is why he sort of chose me. And I also didn't have an infrastructure in place to really protect me. So it's been a long slog.\n\nSo instantly, you got the death threats?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd we'll get to the social media companies in a minute and what they do.\n\nYes, fuck them.\n\nYou have an issue with Jack Dorsey.\n\nIf Jack Dorsey's here, I'm going to slap him in the face.\n\nOkay. All right, he's not.\n\nHe's not a god, calm down. Elon Musk is crazy too, so don't be like falling into that fucking cult. Elon Musk, that fucking guy's nuts.\n\nAll right, speaking of which, you're investigated ...\n\nHe went out with a girlfriend of mine and he parked outside her house for four fucking days.\n\nOkay.\n\nRight, that guy's gonna send you to Mars in four years? Don't count on it. He said that, SpaceX, we're going to Mars in four years. You know how much oxygen, 0.1 percent.\n\nRight, okay.\n\nSo what do you do when you get to Mars? You don't breathe, Elon. How do you deal with these people?\n\nI've interviewed him many times, he says he wants to die on Mars, just not on landing.\n\nFine. He can do it in four hours, according to him.\n\nOkay. They investigated you, they put you on the do-not-fly list.\n\nI was on the no-fly list for two months. The Department of Justice called ...\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they thought ...\n\nCredible threat to the president.\n\nYes. I have a very good ... I got Bloomed by that piece of shit, Lisa Bloom. So I had a disastrous press conference and she's horrible and I'm also allowed to say that, because it's only my opinion. She is bad and a fake feminist. All right, so then I had to call my actual First Amendment attorney who I've been with for years, who actually was at a funeral and didn't pick up his phone that day. So that's kind of how it went down, so that's how I got Bloomed. But his name is Alan Isaacman and he won the landmark Supreme Court case, Jerry Falwell vs. Hustler magazine. So my theory has been, if you can get Larry Flynt off, you can handle me.\n\nAnd he did a very good job and he was very effective. Because the DOJ called his office every single day. \"Is she coming in? Is she coming in today? Is she coming in?\" And I just thought that sounded far and above what they would typically do, certainly to a comedian. So he had to negotiate that I wouldn't go downtown and do the perp walk but I was interrogated under oath, in his office. And what they were considering, they took two months to consider whether or not to charge me with conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States.\n\nWow.\n\nWhich holds a lifetime sentence. So prior to my interrogation, my lawyer said, it wasn't a situation where if I fuck up he can go, \"I need a moment with my client.\" It wasn't like that. And so he said, I'll never forget him saying. \"I love ya, kid, but you fuck up and you leave in cuffs.\" So it was a very serious matter and we had practiced and done murder rooms and all that stuff.\n\nRight, so you're on the do-not-fly, so you couldn't go anywhere.\n\nCouldn't go anywhere. And I make my living by touring, so that was bad.\n\nThat was bad. And other celebrities had insulted the president, Michelle Wolf did and got in trouble.\n\nYeah, she did the White House Correspondents dinner, which I attended, by the way, and she was hilarious. So that was Matt Schlapp and his beard wife making that bullshit up.\n\nOkay.\n\nCould you imagine fucking Matt Schlapp while he looks at Channing Tatum on a video? No, he's super straight, he loves vagina. All right, so that's the crowd Trump runs with, so fuck him.\n\nI actually was at the White House Correspondents dinner, Michelle did really well and I saw Matt and his wife Mercedes leaving and they started tweeting that the whole room, there's this mass exodus. And that just wasn't true. So now that it's happened to me, I'm determined that it won't happen to anybody else.\n\nOther male celebrities, Johnny Depp, Snoop Dogg.\n\nMorrissey.\n\nMorrissey.\n\nYeah, Peter Fonda.\n\nRight.\n\nThey all just got ...\n\nSaid similar things, said threatening things.\n\nYes, allegedly. I mean, they were harmless, but I talked to Peter Fonda and he said he just had a 10-minute phone call with the Secret Service and that was it. I know Johnny Depp was just mysteriously photographed with his Make-A-Wish kid four days later. And he looked hammered even during the picture, I'm not gonna lie. But he had the whole team from Pirates of the Caribbean come in and make sure he could be up and working. So I think in a way, I was the perfect target for that.\n\nPerfect target, so an easy target.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo one of the things you said, there's no bad publicity ... There is bad publicity.\n\nYes, I learned that. There is such a thing as bad publicity.\n\nRight, because your previous career had been, you didn't mind trashing people.\n\nOh, I've been in Hollywood trouble, but never two federal agencies.\n\nSo Hollywood trouble would be?\n\nHollywood trouble is when I won my first enemy ... My first enemy, I got a lot of those now. When I won my first Emmy and I wanted to do a speech that was funny because I think it's funny when people thank Jesus for awards. So I won my first Emmy and I said, \"I just want to say Jesus had nothing to do with this. Suck it, Jesus, this award is my god now.\" So religious groups took out full-page ads in USA Today.\n\nYeah, I remember \"Suck it, Jesus.\"\n\nI got fired from a DirecTV commercial.\n\nRight, okay.\n\nBecause I wouldn't sign the gag order so I could talk about it.\n\nRight. Okay.\n\nI won't be gagged.\n\nSo second to that ... that's Hollywood.\n\nThat's Hollywood trouble. That's when your agents go, \"Oh, what were you thinking?\" But when you get the lawyers saying they've already opened an investigation ... I didn't have an opportunity to even clear my name or say it was a statement. And as you guys know, there's a long history of comedians doing this sort of thing. And I thought ... I didn't know that the shooter was going to give it to TMZ. I thought he was going to send it to Der Spiegel or Charlie Hebdo or something. Or a paper magazine. Once it's on TMZ, then it's on all their ancillary...\n\n... the woodchipper ...\n\n... the woodchipper, yeah.\n\n... the bots start working.\n\nThe bots start. And I didn't even know how that apparatus worked. So I was getting ... my timeline is, to this day, flooded with \"ISIS lady be bad.\" And I had to learn what bots were.\n\nAnd then there was this sort of debate over, no, no, you're just trying to make it better. These are real people. And then I started getting old-timey mail because a lot of Trump ... sacks of mail, like a cartoon. And there were all kinds of ...\n\n... those are real. Those aren't bots.\n\nThose are real people that really think I'm in ISIS. Because it's so believable. And they would say, once again, their favorite method is they would say, \"I want to shoot you in the cunt, cut your head off and then stuff your head up your cunt.\" And that was like the theme. And these are probably 70-year-old straight guys and stuff. Not exactly my demo. So they enjoy the old-timey mail. Some of them would do stickers. And a lot of them would draw me without a head and shit. So that went on.\n\nAnd then the FBI started calling me. And they have three levels of threats ...\n\nNow you're directed to the FBI because of threats.\n\nYep. I'm a big fan of the FBI, let me tell you. They protected me and they did a fantastic job. So they would call me if a threat was like - thank you. They're a government agency. Yes. I'm not anti-government. I'm not one of those at all. I think government is necessary and regulations are good.\n\nSo anyway, if you get a phone call ... If the lawyer gets a phone call, it's like kind of a threat. When they would call me personally, it was jacked up a little bit. And then, as I said in the tape on there, ironically, the day I filmed the movie, the FBI did a no-knock, which means they feel the threat is imminent. So I was sleeping in that day because I had a performance that night, and I was in my PJs. And every time the FBI comes over, they never laugh at this joke. I go \"Norm!\" Like on Cheers . \"Where everybody knows your name...\"\n\nAll right. So they came over and I was used to them saying \"look out for this or that.\" So they said that the MAGA bomber had ... he was already in custody. And they said that he had shared his list with like-minded people. And I said, \"Okay.\" And I said, \"Can you tell me how many?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"So you can't tell me who?' And they said, \"No.\"\n\nThen they suggested that I open my mailbox standing 10 feet away from it. Like the as-seen-on-TV old lady, but I would have to get two of them. So now I just stand in front of it and I go kaboom and I just open it myself.\n\nRight. Are you worried at all?\n\nYeah. I am. And on the other hand, it's been so much of a deluge. I had incidents at almost every show on the American leg of my tour.\n\nMeaning they'll get up and yell at you?\n\nOh, yeah. There was a GoFundMe for some guy that they flew into one of my Philadelphia shows - where I sold out the first one, had to add the double, hey. And he was like a QAnon guy or whatever. So he was in the second row and he starts yelling that I'm a pedophile.\n\nBy the way, you'll have to walk me through how the Trumpers then turned into calling Tom Hanks a pedophile and Sarah Silverman's a pedophile now. Not true.\n\nSo he started yelling that I was a pedophile. And then I got it down to a system where my tour manager and I have a security meeting personally with every gig that I do. And I really wanted to play what I call the great halls because I thought this material wouldn't work in 500-seaters. So here I played the Long Center, which is amazing. And in New York I played Radio City and Carnegie and sold out Carnegie in 24 hours. Very proud of that. I know, right? So I thought there is a story that people want to hear, there's just a disconnect. Which is, the fans were coming out, really, around the world. And so I'm now global if nothing else. Y'all know me.\n\nBut working ... your work in Hollywood has dried up.\n\nI don't have one single day of paid work ahead of me for the rest of my life.\n\nExcept for concerts. Except for ...\n\nI don't have any concerts coming up.\n\nRight. Because of this?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you can't get anyone to distribute this. You paid for this video that you've made?\n\nYes. Yeah. And honestly, the reason I even made it is at first I thought, even my lawyers were saying, you should document this story because it is historic and even if it sits on the shelf for 10 years or something like that. So, I wanted to just do that. And then, when no one from any of the TV or streaming services would even talk to me or ...\n\nNot Netflix, not Amazon?\n\nNone of them. No.\n\nNone of them. And what do they say to you?\n\nWhen it got to the check signers, and this is another important point, there's kind of a ... There's a couple of misleading things I want to clear up. One of them is women do have more power in show business, but to this day, there's not one female that can actually sign the check. So as powerful as Shonda Rhimes has, she still has to kick it up to the old white dinosaur to get a show greenlit. So there are still, I call them the six old white dinosaurs.\n\nOne of them used to be Leslie Moonves, but he's gone. Fuck him, all right. So, he raped his way out of the business. I have no sympathy. And they're all like that. They're all rapey and they're all gross and they're all behind the times and all that shit. So I would be trying to express, well, if the big boss doesn't want to give me the time of day, can you at least give him the stats from my tour? My tour grossed $4.4 million worldwide and I probably made about $75 million over my career.\n\nA friend of mine did a little experiment, which is he called the head of the one of the biggest free agencies in Hollywood and said, what if I could bring you ... No, his first question was, he said, \"Hey, would you like to take on Kathy Griffin?\" And this owner, who I've known for a million years, said, \"Oh, Kathy Griffin? That is a life's-too-short situation.\"\n\nSo, the same friend called the same agent a month later and said, \"What if I could bring you an actor I know, and this guy has made $75 million over his career?\" And the agent goes, \"I would call that a priority client.\" And my friend goes, \"Well, that guy is Kathy Griffin.\" And he still was like, \"Nope, nope, no, toxic, too scary.\" So, you know.\n\nSo what are you going to do? If you can't get at Amazon or Netflix or the more fast-forward ...\n\nWell, I'm hoping they'll come around and I'm hoping that whether it's the almighty dollar or they see possibilities or they see at least the historic value of the show. Although I try to make the show funny first, but there is ...\n\nIt's not all funny. There's some sad parts.\n\nIt's not all funny. Because some of that shit was really scary. And also, I feel a real need to tell people, when I was finally exonerated, I knew I could only do concerts overseas. So the cool thing is, I did really well overseas.\n\nYou're big in Belgium.\n\nThey didn't bat an eyelash. In fact, everywhere I went, and you guys know this if you've traveled, if it was a café or any place, pretty much they'd hear an American accent and be like, \"What the fuck are you guys doing? What's going on? You were the bastion of liberty.\" And so I would deal with that.\n\nBut the audiences were really hungry. And I think the fact that I know Trump sort of was like another layer. And the extent of the investigation and the extent to which they were willing to go to ... And I was obviously just a shiny object. I mean, my photo was days after Robert Mueller had been assigned. You guys have all seen it. When he's in trouble, there's some new shiny object that they'll dangle. And I was a shiny object. But this ...\n\nDo you regret doing the photo?\n\nI don't, because, No. 1, he really has it coming. He really deserves just ... he deserves what he has done to others. Probably most ... most of us probably agree that the most egregious thing is the zero tolerance kids in cages thing. But it's also moving the embassy to Jerusalem was stupid. Not to mention ... Right? I mean, that's just caused violence. There's just so many things that ...\n\nLike I said, at 58, I just thought, if you're not going to take a stand now, what the fuck you waiting for? I just wanted to get the story out there.\n\nAnd, by the way, they can take your phone and SIM card at airports in America. So that was a rumor that I also heard. So I was then put on the Interpol list. So I went overseas, my first show was in Auckland, New Zealand. And that was the first time I was detained. I was then detained at every single airport. Which is ...\n\nWhat do they do when they detain ...\n\nIt's actually really scary. They take your passport and they take your device, your phone, and they put you in a detention room, like The Breakfast Club , I guess. And I was Judd Nelson, apparently. And they don't tell you what they're doing. But their eyes would all turn into saucers.\n\nSo, to this day, I don't know what's on my passport. But it's bad. And then they call the supervisor and they take my passport and my phone and they go away. Sometimes it will be 20 minutes, sometimes I would be two hours. And you're just sitting there not knowing what's going to happen. What are you doing?\n\nI'm looking ... I'm going to read something that you wrote me. But go ahead.\n\nI thought you were bored and you're going to ...\n\nNo, I'm not bored.\n\n\"Mom, look, this is really going slowly. What are you making for dinner? Oh! Oh, I love pork chops.\"\n\nNo. I was going to ask you because I wanted ... it's sexist.\n\nOh, it's totally sexism. And ageism and misogyny.\n\nRight. One of the things you wrote. Would you mind if I read something that you texted me?\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAll right.\n\nI dare you.\n\nI asked you. Okay, well, dare me. You don't know me. I said, \"I have Amy Klobuchar right before you, so get ready for some comb talk,\" because we talked about the issues around the comb and her being a bad boss and stuff like that.\n\nYou wrote me, \"You know what? That whole thing is such Hillary Clinton-level bullshit. Big deal, she threw a binder at someone. I'd fire an assistant who brought me salad without utensils as well. Maybe that assistant would be happier working for Mark Meadows. Amy Klobuchar never pulled out her vagina in front of a worker or a subordinate, I can guarantee you that. Yashar Ali even started this nonsense campaign and got taken to the woodshed for it. But I'm saving all mine for Jack Dorsey. Fuck him and his place on the fucking spectrum. Love, your new best friend, Kathy Griffin.\"\n\nI speak freely. I speak freely.\n\nThere is so much to unpack there. Not the vagina part. But this sexism, the same thing with Amy Klobuchar. She was just talking about this, the idea that she's a bad boss and gets it 20 times more than other ...\n\nI mean, are you kidding? I don't care if she gives someone a concussion. That's nothing compared to Trump whipping his dick out and everybody else whipping their dicks out. Can you guys keep your dicks in for one second? Jesus Christ.\n\nAll right.\n\nI'm not going to let anybody see my vulva once. I know that's crazy. And I also think, knowing the Donald, he likes to be addressed as \"the Donald,\" which is the weird in itself.\n\nRight.\n\nHe's such an idiot. I think that he is the type of man that thinks and resents the audacity that I, at my age, would even dream of staying in the game. And my inner Joan Rivers, I want to basically die onstage and I don't ever really want to retire and I love what I do.\n\nAll right. Let's get to the ... I want to get to tech in just in a minute. But Anderson Cooper. Who didn't stand up for you and who did?\n\nAnderson Cooper did not.\n\nYes, I am aware of that.\n\nSo, yeah, everyone is. That one just really hurt because, I always say, I don't have a punchline for that. I mean, Zucker didn't surprise me because he's just a douchebag. He's not smart enough to run a news agency.\n\nThis is Jeff Zucker?\n\nJeff Zucker. Z-U-C-K-E-R. Although he wants it pronounced \"Zooker, like hooker.\" He said that to me once. \"It's Zooker like hooker.\" I was like, \"Okay. You got me.\"\n\nAnyway, even though I was exonerated, those two guys don't roll like that. It wouldn't be inside them, I don't think, to say, \"Oh it turns out this was kind of a smear campaign and we kind of know what this is.\" And there was a lot of manipulation of the image and all this stuff. And the Anderson thing hurt just because I really loved him as a friend and I ... nobody gave me a heads up or a call or anything like that.\n\nHave you spoken to him since?\n\nNo.\n\nNo? Not at all?\n\nBut did you see that shitfest New Years Eve? Oh. Woo-hoo-hoo, stinker! Oh my God. I watched every minute. I hate-watched it. It was a disaster! Oh, I was in heaven! Talk about chemistry.\n\nDid you think about reaching out to him again, or did you?\n\nYeah. He actually did send me one text that wasn't particularly nice. And I just wrote back. And honestly, I just said, is it okay if I reach out to your mom? Because I really was friendlier with his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt, or as I call her, Glo Vandy. You heard me. And he said yes. I just wrote her an email and I just said I appreciated her friendship. And I said, however you want to proceed is fine with me. I just really wanted to gush over her because she was a really good friend to me.\n\nDo you expect to ever have a discussion with him about that?\n\nHe's not like a talker. But ...\n\n... You have a new gay. You have Bobby from Sarasota.\n\nYeah. I got a ...\n\n... the civilian gays.\n\nThat's right. The civilian gays are on my side. I got ... A couple of days after the photo, one of the gays sent me a photo of all the gays dressed like me on Fire Island with mock heads doing a parade. And all the other gays were like, \"Hey, go girl, go.\" So I was like, oh. I almost cried. So emotional. I mean, that's ... I think that is my kinship with the LGBT community. I think we share a being on the outside looking in, liking to be subversive, having to fight harder for everything, jump higher, fight harder, that sort of thing. So I think that's kind of a natural relationship.\n\nI don't know what's going to happen. I can say none of the power gays have given me a gig or anything, but they might just be scared, too. I don't know. I'm blacklisted everywhere. So I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nSo, I want to talk about where your career's going to go last, but the tech people. You mentioned Jack Dorsey \"on the fucking spectrum.\" Talk about the tech companies. Because you have issues.\n\nWell, I do. Because I now have a little bit of understanding, but this is your area. But I was put into the beyond meme-o-sphere. I didn't know that these tech companies had agents ready. And I remember seeing that guy on 60 Minutes , Brad ...\n\nParscale.\n\nParscale. That fucker is dirty. All right? He should be in front of the grand jury. Oh, by the way, I want to be on that grand jury.\n\nOkay. I'm in charge of the grand jury. But go ahead.\n\nYou are? I was hoping?\n\nNo, no.\n\nMaybe if somebody gets sick or something. I would do it in a heartbeat.\n\nYeah. It's me and Giuliani. But go ahead.\n\nOh. So anyway, as I was taking such an online beatdown, I was also learning at the same time, some of the non-robots coming over me, like I said, I had to educate myself about all these Trumpers and the subgroups and the rise of Nazism among young people. Because I'm from Oak Park, Illinois, and it was this really big deal. I don't know if you guys remember the Nazis ...\n\nYes, the Nazis.\n\nWhen the Nazis marched in Skokie. And it was like a civic event. The whole city talked about it for years and people protested. And they never came back. So it blows my ... It makes me really sad that there's now a whole new generation getting misinformation that turns them into full-blown Nazis. And they don't care for me.\n\nAnd so you've got the Breitbart folks and tied in with that group, and I did not know that some of them have large social media presences and that their followers have no interest in legit news at all. So, that's why ...\n\nWhat do these companies do? What do you want Jack Dorsey to do?\n\nWell, first of all, he should resign. The first order of business, he needs to resign. Because I got fucked into ... remember when he was covering Ferguson? I remember thinking, he's like this forward-thinking guy and he's going to document the riots in Ferguson, and that's good for him. Next thing you know, he's not banning any of these Nazis or super-far-right QAnon folks and stuff. I don't believe they don't have the capability. But you could answer that question. Is it really, truly out of their hands?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, what the fuck?\n\nYeah. What the fuck?\n\nAre you going to call him?\n\nI can. But not right now.\n\nLet's call him and on speaker.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nCome on! (cheering)\n\nNo.\n\nGet that stick out of your ass! Let's have a little fun.\n\nNo. N-O.\n\nHe would take my call.\n\nYeah, okay. You do. You call people.\n\nI do. I called Marty Singer. He's one of the attorneys that would go after the #MeToo victims and threaten them. I also called one of the Nazis from Charlottesville, the crying one, Chris Cartwell. And I was like, \"Hey, it's Kathy Griffin, bitch. How does it feel now, mother fucker?\" And just hang up. By the way, it's very smart of me to identify myself. He's out of jail now. Shit. I didn't think of that part.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut the thing with the social media thing is, I thought Sheryl Sandberg was a hero with the Lean In and ... Although let me just say about Lean In , every time I've tried to lean in, I broke my fucking nose. So, she should have written a sequel. But anyway, I don't know what their game is, because how much money do you need? And if they were taking rubles, etc., and you can tell me, but I would suspect it's more than just Russians?\n\nRight. It's Chinese. It's all of them.\n\n... and maybe some Americans. But that is something that I fear. Because I don't see them making any moves and their testimony in front of the Senate was just really embarrassing for the Senate because they didn't know an iPhone from Google. For real. Gohmert. I don't see them signaling anything that they want to protect their users.\n\nI think ... Two things I always say is, they want all of the benefits but none of the responsibilities of running the platform.\n\nI am a living example of that.\n\nThey did not contact you when you started getting strafed on social media?\n\nNot at all. Not at all.\n\nThey never escalated you to a VIP kind of status?\n\nI don't even know what that means. I have a blue check?\n\nThey should have contacted you if you'd gotten - if you'd reported death ... you just filled in like everybody else, the death threats?\n\nYes. I fill in the thing and I send it.\n\nNo.\n\nOh, is it true ... I want to ask you this. Is it true that the way, I think it's a robot, I heard a rumor that if you follow them for a minute and then block them, it kills the mother bot. Is that true?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nOh, shit. Kara, I thought you had some bot-killing trick.\n\nNo. I don't have a bot-killing trick. But they didn't contact you when you ...\n\nNo one contacted me. No one but the FBI.\n\nNobody but the FBI?\n\nNo.\n\nNone of the social media companies. What should happen to them? Should they be subject to regulation?\n\nYeah. Well, first of all, we have to get more people in elected positions that know what social media is, that know how it works.\n\nYeah. Right.\n\nYeah. They don't know the questions to ask and I thought Zuckerberg's testimony was frightening. I mean, seriously. Those beady eyes, I know it's a joke. That's not human. So I don't necessarily think he's real.\n\nHe is.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nHe is.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you seen blood? Or is it ice?\n\nI've seen it.\n\nAll right. Remember one summer when he annoyed a bunch of people and went to their house for dinner and thought it was a big treat for them? Can you imagine? Knock knock. \"It's me, Jeff Zuckerberg.\" Okay.\n\nMark Zuckerberg.\n\nOh, sorry. Mark. I'm thinking of Jeff Zucker. I have residual anger for ... But I wouldn't even let him in. I'd be like, \"Get the fuck out, you fucking cheater.\" Because I actually think they are as complicit or, rather, responsible for manipulating worldwide elections. I mean, worldwide.\n\nSo the idea that Nazism is on the rise in Germany where, as you know, it was ... the only European country I know of where it was at least technically illegal. And Poland is now an autocracy. And even Italy is getting kleptocracy. So I blame them for all of that.\n\nI was in London a month ago where I gave a speech on the First Amendment at Oxford University. Oh, fuck off. You guys are like this, \"Went there. Yawn. Yawn.\" I didn't even go to college! That's a big deal for me. I went to...\n\nEverybody! Oxford!\n\nNow you're talking down to me. So anyway, one of the reasons I am here is, obviously, I was the first of many. But if they're stripping John Brennan of his fucking security clearance, they will stop at nothing. And my story is unique in that I did and do have the means to defend myself. But I've also met many, many people, as you know, this inaugural had more protesters actually arrested and put in jail than any other inaugural. So those folks got to show up for a trial. They've got to pay for, hopefully, legal fees because you need a lawyer in those situations.\n\nSo that's one of the reasons I want to get the message out, it really is not a showbiz story. It's all fields. And that's why I also think the ageism and sexism, misogyny tie in. I think the more younger electeds we get that can talk about unionizing indigenous women, women that are forgotten, women that have been incarcerated, getting people who have been incarcerated the right to vote when they get out, stuff like that.\n\nI don't even understand how stuff trends on Twitter. Is that manipulated? Or are those actually the top 20 things people are talking about?\n\nWell, they can push things. If they push virality, speed, and engagement, that's what they're going to get.\n\nOkay, so how does that work? Let's say that they want #MuteHillary. That's got to be some fucking group, right?\n\nWell, you can manipulate those algorithms.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\nYou can use ... These are very sophisticated ...\n\nDo I have to buy an algorithm? What is that?\n\nNo. You don't have to buy an algorithm. But they're very manipulable. They don't want to take responsibility for what goes on in their process.\n\nHere's what I want to know what they have the nerve to say to you because you actually know how this shit works.\n\nRight. They tell me they're not, that it's really hard after having previous ...\n\nWait a minute. I just got an idea.\n\nWhat?\n\nLet's role play.\n\nAll right. And then we have questions.\n\nYou're going to play Kara Swisher, okay. I'm going to play Jack Dorsey. Are you ready?\n\nI just was online with him, we just did an online thing.\n\n\"Hey, I just came from a Nazi rally, how are you?\" I'm embellishing. I'm an artist. \"What's your question, you fucking dyke bitch?\" I'm playing character, I'm playing a character. \"How do you like my beard, I'm in ZZ Top.\" And then what?\n\nI would not know what to say.\n\nBut you really call these fools on the carpet.\n\nI do.\n\nDo they actually try to convince even you ...\n\nYes.\n\n... like, \"Oh, we didn't see this coming.\"\n\n\"We're trying, we didn't see this coming. We're trying really hard. Kara, don't be so mean to us.\"\n\nOh my God! Let's go through together.\n\nOkay.\n\nBecause I will kick some fucking ass on your behalf.\n\nAll right, okay. We're going to have some questions from the audience via Slido. Let's see: \"What are your general thoughts on the 2020 elections and current candidates, Kathy?\"\n\nI think that the thing that's great is that, I'm obviously a Democrat, and I think the thing that's great is, I think we have an amazing stable. And I think what's fucked up is that already social media is contributing to the right-wing notion that we have a bunch of horrible choices. And I think we have an embarrassment of riches. I personally would like to see a smart, competent female president before I die, so that's where I'm coming from. But what the good news is, I think there's many, many stars in there, many stars.\n\nAny particular favorite?\n\nI have a little hard-on for Booker/Harris, Harris/Booker, and I don't care who's who. Don't boo Cory Booker, he's a good guy. I had lunch with him.\n\nOkay, you had lunch with ... Is there a ...\n\nI feel like Booker gets a hard time.\n\nHe does.\n\nWhy? Oh, he took corporate money for two months?\n\nI don't know.\n\nGrow up!\n\nOkay. \"Is there a problem with hate speech in the US? Should it be regulated as it is in many other democratic countries?\"\n\nHonestly, I think it should be regulated on social media first. I actually think they should be the pioneers because, as you know, in anonymity, it's very different than if you yell \"fire\" in a theater, which is breaking the First Amendment. What I did is not breaking the First Amendment.\n\nDo you believe in some regulation on social media?\n\nOn social media first and, frankly, I would like to see how it works there before you impose it on people. And being a comedian, we live in fear of free speech being limited in any way, and journalists of course. I want to have them try it online first.\n\nI would like them to first get rid of bots, which they can do. The bots do gin up, you saw during the Samantha Bee/Roseanne Barr thing.\n\nYes.\n\nIt was really interesting. The bots don't care what side, they just want to create discord. They were doing the, \"Rosanne is terrible,\" and they were doing, \"Sam Bee is terrible,\" and then humans join in.\n\nHow come Americans don't get their goal? It's so transparent.\n\nWell, I think a lot of people, a very well-known reporter I know was ...\n\nWho?\n\nI'm not telling you.\n\nBret Stephens?\n\nYeah, Bret Stephens.\n\nI knew it. I don't trust Bret Stephens as far as I can throw him.\n\nIt's not Bret Stephens, but anyway.\n\nWho? Charlie Sykes?\n\nNo, I'm not telling you, it's not.\n\nOh, not David Frum. You're not believing his bullshit. \"Axis of evil,\" remember that shit? David Frum.\n\nIn any case, they were arguing with a bot and I had to text them and say, \"Hey, that's a bot you're arguing with.\"\n\nYou're a good friend.\n\nI know.\n\nThat's a call I'd like to get.\n\nI know, I will.\n\nArgue with a bot and...\n\nLet's get to: \"Kathy, are you single?\"\n\nI am single. And I've got to say, my boyfriend was a rockstar during the whole thing. And it sucks, we just broke up four months ago.\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know why. All I can say is a relationship works until it didn't. But he was a great guy and what's ironic is I referred to him quite a bit in the film because he was with me for so many things.\n\nRight, so you are single?\n\nFifty-eight. And are there any like 50-year-old, I want like a 50-year-old attorney, CPA. I want a real job, not you fucking venture capitalists with your apps. I want a dental plan.\n\nYeah, okay.\n\nI want a defined benefit plan, not bitcoin. What's the matter with these people, bitcoin. Can you imagine? Bitcoin.\n\nSo you're looking for a man.\n\nThey believed it?\n\nYou're looking for a man.\n\nI'm waiting for a man to be lucky enough to find me.\n\nAll right, okay, good. Well said. You said backstage, you're close to being fluid, right?\n\nIf it would help my career, I'd turn fluid in a heartbeat, binary fluid, oh, and bipolar is very trendy. Yes, that's my announcement, I'm bipolar and fluid.\n\nOkay, well, you're going to come to our lesbian parties now.\n\nI wouldn't miss a lesbian party!\n\nAll right, okay, all right. They'll stick by you. You can join our Militia Etheridge.\n\nI was hoping.\n\nOkay: \"Have you been able to persuade anyone from the other side's opinion by sharing your story? Should we engage with racists, misogynists, etc.?\"\n\nNo, not at all. Not at all. I have a ton of relatives that don't talk to me. I will say that my ex's parents are big Trumpers and they had news vans outside their house because his dad and he have the same name, so that didn't help.\n\nBut I will say - this is the only funny story - but the amount of people that legit think I'm in ISIS to this day is sort of funny now, but it's also shocking. But that day, my mom, my beloved mother, who I'm sorry to say is now in the throes of dementia, but I'm sure you know her and she was a national treasure.\n\nAnd she watches Fox, like my mom.\n\nShe watches ... what the fuck, right?\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nDo you ever yell at her?\n\nAll the time.\n\nRight, me too. I was like, \"I don't care how sick you are, turn it off.\" All right, so I'm a very good nurse. I'm a very good nurse. Anyway, my Mom that day calls me and it's a crazy day and I'm crying and all sorts of stuff. And she calls me and she was watching Fox, but her hearing aids weren't in because they would have hid the petals in her hair, it's an old-person thing. And her vision was really going.\n\nShe goes, \"I was watching my boyfriend, Sean Hannity, and he says you joined Al-Qaeda, and out of all the clubs you could have joined, dod damn it, why did you join Al-Qaeda?\" So my own mother thought I had joined Al-Qaeda, as she says it, and then wanted me to take up stamp collecting or a normal hobby. It took like a good week to talk my own mother out of the fact that I'm not in ISIS.\n\n\"Kara, how does this career hit that Kathy endured impact the world of tech? What are the similarities between this and the Bezos thing?\"\n\nI think Bezos managed to hit back pretty hard himself. He did, he wasn't putting up ... he is the world's richest man so he does have assets, so to speak, to do that, right?\n\nYeah. He actually inspired me because I actually wrote a thread. I have a next-door neighbor that I'm in a civil suit with and he's a Trumper and he stands at the wall, we have a shared wall.\n\nThat's where the Kardashians used to live?\n\nNo, the other side. The Kardashians were a dream. I swear to God, I know that's hard to believe.\n\nThey were neighbors.\n\nBut they were my next-door neighbors during this whole thing, which I hope if you see the film ... the stories that got cut - can I tell one story that ...\n\nAll right, hurry quickly, we only have time for one question.\n\nAll right, so get this. Kim is dumb as a box of rocks, but she's super sweet, like really sweet. One day I called her and I said, \"My mom's really depressed, can you send the kids over?\" And she did, and it was really sweet and stuff.\n\nSo the husband's crazy, I call him Pabs because he thinks he's Pablo Picasso and he writes \"Pablo\" on all his designer clothes. So anyway, he went on one of those 5150 cycles, which I'm this close to doing. That's when you go to the nut bin and just rest. He came back and I never heard from Pabs, he's not a talker. My then-boyfriend runs into the kitchen and he goes, \"Holy shit, you're not going to believe what Kanye just did.\"\n\nWell, who wouldn't react to that? So I go, \"What?\" So Pabs comes home and of course I'm not going to bother him, it's a serious day. He goes in the backyard and he goes, \"AAAAHHHH,\" like that. Loud, and then, like at level 10, he blares up fucking Enya, \"Far and away, far and away, far and away, AAAAHHHH. Far and away, AAAAHHHH, far and away, far and away.\" I can't not tell you that, that's why we need the First Amendment!\n\nAnd your other neighbor?\n\nOh, the other neighbor stands at the wall and he calls me a cunt and a bitch and, \"Oh, Trump put the heat on you, you bald dyke,\" because I had shaved my head in solidarity with my sister who had passed away from cancer two days prior to the incident. Anyway, so I wrote a thread about it and I ran it by all my very expensive lawyers and I really was inspired by the Bezos media thing. I just thought, he's a CEO of a very powerful company called KB Home and I thought, \"Boy, I thought those ...\" And his name is Jeffrey T. Mezger. Anyway, that's all covered. It's all covered.\n\nSo I thought, you know, I have so many friends that have been so much braver than I in the #MeToo and Time's Up movement, that I thought, \"Well, what am I being quiet for because this guy's so ... \" I'm about putting it out there.\n\nOkay, all right, okay. So we just had this one.\n\n\"How do you spend your future days after this career hit? The documentary sounds brilliant\" - and it is, by the way - \"but will take time. Should you go to Greece and open a club?\" I guess, like Lindsay Lohan.\n\nWell, naturally I would have Lindsay be the CFO because she is someone you can count on, and the little dancing. I spend my days working and producing and writing and pitching. I have had more meetings and I have met with every network and streaming service. I actually, like I can't believe I'm here. This is the only \"yes\" I've gotten in the year. So thank you, thank you.\n\nYou know, several dudes didn't want to interview you, but I was just good with it, I was so good with it. Anyway, next question. \"How do you feel about Meghan McCain?\"\n\nOh, you know. She's all right.\n\nShe's all right? Okay.\n\nYou know, I don't dislike her. I don't like when she goes off, \"Do you really want to be Venezuela?!\" Like, \"Okay, girl, calm down.\" She does those Fox buzzwords.\n\nOkay, all right. \"First, thank you. Question: What's the advice you give a young woman entering the workforce today?\"\n\nI give advice that is probably not welcome, but it's real. I say, first of all, in comedy in particular, don't do it unless you love it because you're going to bomb more than you do well and if you don't have a burning desire to do it, it's probably not your thing, if you're just using it as a stepping stone.\n\nBut what I also tell young women, especially women of color is, I just am honest. I'll just say, \"You're not going to get equal pay.\" These chicks that get 87 cents on the dollar, God love them. I get like a nickel on the dollar and it's been like that my whole life. I just tell them, \"You're going to have to work harder and jump higher, and you're going to have to watch the guys get paid more and they may be better, the same or lesser than you in their work capacity.\"\n\nI just think it's better to be honest about that because I'm chairman of the new Time's Not Up Yet campaign. I think Time's Up is great, but I think frankly, under this administration, it's struggling because it's hard to get movement when you've got these two movements happening, MeToo and Time's Up and then you've got this whole umbrella of complete sexism and Don Jr. like making fun of MeToo, etc.\n\nI just say, \"Know that you've got to work harder and get in there and dig in and do whatever it takes,\" and it's a lot of figuring out. Like, for me, I can't get in the front door, so I figure out a way to get in the side window.\n\nBut I would also say, educate yourself. I took over my own promotion and my tour business because the white boys at Live Nation weren't happy when I said, \"I'd like to start promoting my own shows.\" They said, \"You think you're a better promoter than us?\" I said, \"No, you have to accept that picture overnight made me a totally different type of artist. I can no longer play the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, where I used to just go and make fun of the housewives.\" The last tour had a specific message and they would put me in banner ads with Toby Keith. So I hired a DC marketing company. I started my first mailing list at the ripe age of 57, and text list. And that's really what sold out the tour. I then started ...\n\nYou are a different kind of artist now. You're not ...\n\nI'm Hanoi Jane . In the way that Hanoi Jane, that photo, is with Jane to this day, I am very cognizant that that photo will be with me.\n\nAnd your topics will change, right? Because you didn't talk about politics, you talked about housewives and- ...\n\nYeah, some guy I was banging, or whatever.\n\nRight. But you can't do that now?\n\nWell, I'm not banging anybody.\n\nOkay. Last two questions, we only have a few seconds.\n\nYet! It's early in the day.\n\nLet's see, which one, we have just one more left: \"Have you considered crowdfunding the release of your movie?\" If you can get into that very quickly, we'll do one more.\n\nCrowdfunding?\n\nCrowdfunding.\n\nNo, because I have enough money and I don't want hardworking people to give their money, you know what I mean? I also did a lot of charity stuff, like I did the tie-in with Trevor Project and American Cancer Society and Time's Up. So I would do shows where ticket sales went to those events as well. I'm actually going to start a run in LA at the Laugh Factory, which is really how I got my first big break.\n\nAnd even though I said I would never do clubs again, I'm going to do, there's five Mondays in April, and it's literally just going to be a new hour every week. The show is called Kathy Griffin, A New Hour Every Week because, if nothing else, I'm prolific. So maybe that will make the industry people go, \"Oh, she's not like these guy comics that need like two years to come up with 20 minutes.\"\n\nRight, last question here.\n\nAnd I'm doing it for free, pro bono.\n\nAll right. We really have just one second to finish.\n\nDon't yell at me.\n\nI won't yell at you. I'm not yelling at you. I'm speaking in a quiet voice.\n\nCan we call Dorsey just real quick?\n\nNo. One of the things ... I'm going to finish, one of the things in this movie, which I think is also very ... there's sad parts of it. You can feel a sadness in it. And I want you to just comment on this and then we can get going and go to our parties and finding you a date.\n\nOkay. At the lesbian party?\n\nAt the lesbian party. There's some very attractive lesbians.\n\nI'm pro lesbian. Pro, okay.\n\nWhen you said in the movie, \"I'm the girl who never learned a lesson.\"\n\nYes, \"I'm Kathy Griffin and I never learned my lesson.\"\n\nWhat does that mean? Should you learn your lesson?\n\nNo. And I'll tell you why. All the things that I've done that a bunch of old white guys told me I shouldn't have done, are the things that made me successful. That's why I proudly say, I bought my house, $10.5 million cash, because I'm friends with Suze Orman and Suze says, \"Girlfriend, if you can't pay cash, that means you can't afford it! Denied!\"\n\nShe's a lesbian, lesbian?\n\nThe ultimate, President Orman 2020, that's my dream.\n\nAll right.\n\nBut also, I just think it's important that women come out of the shadows about money and talk about how much they make because that's how you'll know what your market value is. You can't just believe the guy who's telling you.\n\nLast question, do you regret any of this?\n\nNo. It's still, should I have to deal with, like when I went to England there was a driver dude that took me from London Heathrow to the hotel. And he said he was Moroccan and that if we were in Morocco, he would cut my tongue off. This is a month ago. Of course, I thought I could talk him out of it and I said, \"Are you aware that President Trump called all of Africa shithole countries?\" He said, \"I don't believe it, he's the greatest president in the history of America.\" So that's what you're dealing with. I assume he gets his information from social media. I'm assuming that. Yeah, it was just all about ... that's my new normal. Trying to get to a hotel before this guy cuts my tongue out.\n\nOh, wow, that's a bummer, Kathy. Do you have a joke to tell?\n\nI do have a joke because, No. 1, I filmed it and then I was in such a rage because the company was CLS Empire and I called the vice president and he was really cool about it and fired the guy and all this stuff. I said, \"I am not going to be able to live with myself if I read a month from now some woman got her fucking tongue cut out.\" I filmed me reading him the riot act. It's a really fancy hotel and I'm screaming at him, \"Oh, yeah, say it again, say you want to cut my tongue off. If you can get there first, if we don't cut your dick off first, so it's going to be a fucking horse race.\" Admittedly, I look very ready for a 5150, but I'm glad I did it.\n\nKathy Griffin, everybody.\n\nKara Swisher, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Recode.net.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow the company's transition to for-profit will affect everyone.\n\nWhy you need a battery-powered house.\n\nComputing has a big energy appetite. What does that mean for our climate goals?\n\nAmerica's EV charging network is stronger than ever.\n\nTed Kaczynski's apocalyptic vision still has a following, 30 years later.\n\nThe tech right's collapsing case for the Trump presidency.﻿\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Death threats, cancellations, investigations: Kathy Griffin says she would do it all again\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMarch 24, 2019 / 9:58 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nIf you decide you do not want to read this article about Kathy Griffin, the comedian wants you to know she'd understand. But for her part, Griffin has gotten pretty used to rejection from a certain segment of the U.S. population. \"I'm Hanoi Jane, you know? I get it. This photo is gonna be with me forever, no matter what I do.\"\n\nThe photo, now infamous, was taken in 2017, and featured Griffin holding a mask of President Trump dripping with what appeared to be fake blood. (It was actually ketchup.) \"Well, I didn't have any fake blood. I usually don't stock it!\" she laughed.\n\nGriffin said the photo was meant as political satire, but that didn't stop all hell from breaking loose. The president reacted, tweeting: \"Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!\"\n\nEven Griffin's 98-year-old mother was upset with her: \"She called me up and she said, 'I thought I heard that you were in al Qaeda. Why wouldn't you join another club?'\"\n\nGriffin was used to controversy, but this was on a whole other level. \"I never in my lifetime thought anything like this could happen,\" she said.\n\nCaught off-guard by the visceral response, she went into crisis management mode, releasing this video in which she said: \"I sincerely apologize. I am just now seeing the reaction to these images. I'm a comic. I crossed the line. I moved the line, then I crossed it. I went way too far.\"\n\nBut the damage was done. Her comedy tour was cancelled; she lost her endorsement deal with something called Squatty Potty; and she found herself under investigation for conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States - a charge that potentially carries a life sentence.\n\n\"My little story is historic,\" she said. \"Whether you like it or not, it's the first time a sitting United States president has used the full power of the Oval Office, the first family, the right-wing media and, more importantly, two departments within the Department of Justice to open an investigation on a private citizen who did nothing wrong. Didn't violate he First Amendment, didn't break the law.\"\n\nAt a press conference, Griffin was emotional when she spoke of Mr. Trump's, and the government's, response: \"To be honest, he broke me.\"\n\nGriffin says her name ended up on the no-fly list, and CNN fired her from her long-running gig co-hosting their New Year's Eve special with Anderson Cooper. \"I really did love Anderson and I really loved doing that gig. And it was a lot of fun. And, you know, they just couldn't get over it.\"\n\nCorrespondent Luke Burbank asked, \"What would you be without your comedy?\"\n\n\"I thought about that a lot, and I thought about it immediately. So, one of the first things I did was I wrote a couple of scripts that I'm not even in. I thought, 'I can do that,' you know? And I thought, 'Well, maybe somebody will buy a script from me if it doesn't say Kathy Griffin.'\"\n\nBut even without her name attached, she said there was little interests. Now, this is the part of the story where a lot of people as rich as Kathy Griffin would have just gone into early retirement. But not Griffin. \"I thought: 'Well, I know how to be funny, and I know how to get people to buy tickets.' Because I'm pretty sure there's a whole bunch of countries overseas that really don't like Trump. And that's how it all started.\"\n\nSo, she hit the road again, but only after taking control of her business, learning how to book every element of it herself, from renting the theaters, to marketing the shows, to hiring the ushers. \"I think it was 13 countries and 26 cities. And then I thought, 'Okay, I'm onto something.'\"\n\nHer tour grossed more than $4 million. \"And yet, I don't have a single day of paid work on television ahead of me for the rest of my life,\" she said.\n\nBut she'll always have the stage. Her world tour became the basis for her new comedy special, called \"Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story.\"\n\nGriffin has won all kinds of awards for her TV work and comedy specials. But she's still looking for a distributor for this new film, which may serve as a reminder that her life might never go back to how it used to be.\n\nBurbank asked, \"Are you still getting death threats to this day?\"\n\n\"Yes, online and in person,\" Griffin said. \"I was in London a month ago and I had a driver who took myself and my assistant from London Heathrow to the hotel, and he recognized me from the photo and he said that he was from Morocco and that if we were in Morocco he would cut my tongue off.\n\n\"So, that was a long drive!\" she laughed.\n\n\"What kind of rating did you give that driver?\" Burbank asked.\n\n\"I called the president of the company and had him fired!\" she replied.\n\nDespite what she's been through (or what some might argue she put herself through), Griffin says she doesn't want anyone feeling sorry for her. After all, she does live in a $10.5 million mansion in Bel Air, California that she paid for in cash. \"It's heaven. I'm not gonna lie. It's heaven.\"\n\nAnd she's comforted by two rescue dogs: Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler. \"They have been game changers. Like, I know I sound really corny, but I do everything wrong: I let them sleep in bed with me, I cuddle with them, and I feel their little heartbeats against me, and they've really gotten me through, honestly.\"\n\nAnd then there's the therapy, too. \"Oh, yeah. I go to therapy as much as I can. I've been doing that since I was 18. I mean, the therapy sessions were, like, how to just put one foot in front of the other.\"\n\nAnd, she says, it was fellow comedian Jim Carrey who called her out of the blue with some much-needed advice: \"This phrase has always stuck with me. He goes: 'You're going to take as long a time as you need to process it, and then you're going to put it through your Kathy Griffin comedy prism and you're gonna make the story funny and relatable, and you're gonna go tell it.' So thank you, Jim Carrey!\"\n\nNow that there's some light at the end of the tunnel, Kathy Griffins says, at 58, she's done apologizing.\n\nBurbank asked, \"If you could click your heels together and go back and just like, at the end of the photo shoot before the mask came out, could it just been like, 'Let's call it a day,' would you?\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"'cause I've learned so much. I think a lot of people would love it if I said, 'Oh, I wish I had never taken that picture. I wish I had never cursed. I wish I had never made this comment or that comment.' But the most important thing that I hope people see is that, long after I kick the bucket, they see the crazy red-haired lady didn't go down.\"\n\nOr, as she told the audience on tour, \"One of the things I want you to take away from tonight [is] I'm Kathy Griffin and I never learn my lesson!\"\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Jay Kernis.\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Experimental rock bands bring tour to the Kilowatt in San Francisco\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 19, 2025 / 10:22 AM PDT / CBS San Francisco\n\nA pair of veteran experimental rock groups pay a rare visit to San Francisco Thursday when Oneida and Kinski bring their tandem tour to San Francisco's Mission District.\n\nPushing the boundaries of modern experimental rock since the late '90s, both the Brooklyn-based Oneida and Seattle band Kinski have become cornerstones of their respective scenes over the past quarter century plus of music making. Started in 1997 by drummer/composer John Colpitts (aka Kid Millions) and guitarist Pat Sullivan (who performed under the moniker PCRZ or Papa Crazee), the group's first album A Place Called El Shaddai's drew on a number of auxiliary musicians to create the collection's improvisational noise-rock tunes that nodded to NYC forebears like Sonic Youth while incorporating elements of '60s garage, hard rock, punk and psychedelia. That effort and the similarly freewheeling follow-up Enemy Hogs came out on the  indie label Turnbuckle Records, but when the imprint suddenly closed up shop without warning in 1999, the band moved to Jagjaguwar Records for the next decade.\n\nAn expanded line-up featuring keyboardist Bobby Matador and bassist/guitarist Hanoi Jane contributed to what would be a torrent of releases during the 2000s (even after Sullivan's departure at the end of 2001) that included splits and singles with fellow experimentalists Liars, Brother JT, Plastic Crimewave Sound and Pterodactyl, side projects by band members while bringing longtime collaborators Shahin Motia and Barry London into the fold. Later in the decade, the outfit released its ambitious self-described \"triptych\" Thank Your Parents that was sprawled across three separate recordings that delved further into the avant-garde with its explorations of minimalism and drone.\n\nAt the same time, Oneida had earned no small amount of notoriety for performances in non-traditional public spaces -- many held at their own practice and studio space the Ocropolis in Brooklyn's Williamsburg -- that would sometimes stretch for hours-long improvisational odysseys at the fringe All Tomorrow's Parties festivals held in the UK and on the East Coast  with guest appearances by such mavericks as Boredoms, Flaming Lips, Deerhoof, the Dead C, Mike Watt, Portishead, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor.\n\nThe ensemble took a break from releasing new studio work (though a steady stream of archival recordings from the now defunct Ocropolis and elsewhere would come out), but resurfaced in 2016 with What's Your Sign? -- a collaboration with minimalist composer Rhys Chatham. The group's more recent output on Joyful Noise Recordings including the more traditionally song-focused Success in 2022 and last year's acclaimed shift back into more unpredictable territory Expensive Air show Oneida remains one of the most formidable creative ensembles in American experimental rock. The current tour brings them back to the Bay Area for the first time in over a decade.\n\nCurrent tour partners Kinski have forged a similarly singular (if less prolific) path  since first coming together in 1998 after drummer Dave Weeks was serving beers in a Seattle pub and joined a conversation with guitarist Chris Martin and bassist Lucy Atkinson about the merits of analog recording. Delving into a spacious, heavily psychedelic style of tuneful alternative rock, the band started writing tunes, bringing on multi-instrumentalist Matthew Reid Schwartz by the end of the following year.\n\nThe band's self-released debut Space Launch For Frenchie revealed a debt to propulsive krautrock rhythms and extended space-rock jams as much as the layered guitar-drones of Spacemen 3 -- a locomotive cover of that band's song \"Losing Touch with My Mind\" closed the recording. While Kinski toured extensively with other indie-rock outfits like Hovercraft and Silkworm, their first jaunt with Japanese psych band Mainliner established an important connection with guitarist and Acid Mothers Temple founder Kawabata Makoto.\n\nIn addition to touring Japan with AMT, Kinski would record a collaborative split with the iconic Japanese psychedelic travelers that Seattle label Sub Pop released in 2003 after issuing Kinski's debut for the label Airs Above Your Station earlier that year. At that point, Weeks had moved on and was replaced by current drummer Barrett Wilke. The band's growing reputation for interstellar sonic  exploration onstage  led to higher profile tour support gigs with reunited post-punk giants Mission of Burma and Tool.\n\n2012 saw the band join the Kill Rock Stars roster, who released Kinski's next three offerings starting with Cosy Moments. In 2018, the group marked its 20th anniversary with a vinyl reissue of their second album Be Gentle With the Warm Turtle and their then new effort Accustomed To Your Face . Last year saw the ensemble return to its roots as a power trio with the departure of Reid Schwartz. The band just released its first recording for the Comedy Minus One imprint entitled Stumbledown Terrace that was recorded with renowned Bay Area producer/engineer Tim Green at his North Bay facility Louder Studios.\n\nThe bands are joined on this West Coast tour that stops at the Kilowatt Thursday night by SF heavy experimental power trio Terry Gross. Contrary to what one might expect from a band named after the unflappably calm NPR interviewer, the threesome bashes out a bruising, kinetic style of krautrock-influenced groove displayed on their debut recording Shameless Imposter , a two-song 10\" vinyl EP released on Valley King Records in 2018.\n\nFeaturing the six-string heroics of the Champs and Trans Am guitarist Phil Manley, Terry Gross came together three years earlier when he started playing with his El Studio co-owner, bassist Donny Newenhouse (Film School, Hot Fog, Buffalo Tooth). The split of Newenhouse's band Peace Creep with talented drummer Phil Becker (Pins of Light, ex-Triclops! and Lower Forty-Eight; Becker is also a partner at El Studio and an accomplished engineer) and Triclops!/Anywhere guitarist Christian Eric Beaulieu led to some informal jam sessions with Manley and the rhythm section at the studio, sparking the new project.\n\nDigitally recording their freewheeling improvisations at El Studio, the trio began developing its unique chemistry that found the musicians exploring hypnotic extended grooves that at times recalled the droning motorik workouts of German rock experimentalists Can and Neu, but with the added heft of modern rock titans like the Melvins. Terry Gross started playing live shows on both sides of the Bay, sharing stages with the likes of Big Business, reunited Oakland favorites Drunk Horse and Hot Lunch and establishing a reputation for dealing out their unusual style heady, muscular extended tunes.\n\nLast September, the group unleashed its latest effort, Huge Improvement . Featuring a trio of propulsive prog-punk tunes clocking in at over seven minutes that bookend the extended droning menace of \"Full Disclosure\" that captures one of the threesome's instant compositions as it happened live in the studio without overdubs or editing, Terry Gross continues to refine its unique sonic chemistry.\n\nOneida and Kinski with Terry Gross Thursday, March 20, 8 p.m. $20 The Kilowatt\n\nDave Pehling is website managing editor for CBS Bay Area.

      "text": "< Still Reinventing At 80, Jane Fonda Says, 'I Feel Better Than I Ever Have'\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Jane Fonda has lived many lives from starlet to fitness guru to Vietnam protester and now a comedic actress, securing roles at an age when most people in Hollywood have left the screen. A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong.

SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J.

And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel.

FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up.

And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J.

And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something?

I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J.

And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J.

And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot.

And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life.

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true.

SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

At the rally, Tarantino said, \"I have to call the murdered the murdered, and I have to call the murderers the murderers\" - drawing considerable backlash from police unions. Kena Betancur/Getty Images hide caption\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino attends a march to denounce police brutality in New York City on Oct. 24. At the rally, Tarantino said, \"I have to call the murdered the murdered, and I have to call the murderers the murderers\" - drawing considerable backlash from police unions.\n\nQuentin Tarantino isn't apologizing for his comments last month about police shootings - but he is trying to explain.\n\nAt a rally against police brutality in New York City on Oct. 24, the film director provoked a storm of criticism when he referred to shootings by police as \"murders.\"\n\n\"When I see murder, I cannot stand by,\" he said at the rally, \"and I have to call the murdered the murdered, and I have to call the murderers the murderers!\"\n\nPolice unions, furious with the remarks, have called for people to boycott Tarantino's upcoming movie. Tarantino, for his part, told the Los Angeles Times that he never meant all cops are murderers - just the officers involved in certain high-profile shootings.\n\nThat explanation hasn't mollified the police unions.\n\n\"Tarantino is a Hollywood figure, and he has a following,\" says Sgt. Jerretta Sandoz, vice president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League , one of the groups calling for a boycott of Tarantino and his movies. If the LAPD officers follow through on that call, it could become a real headache for the director.\n\n\"Off-duty police officers are very important,\" she says. \"There's motor officers, as well as patrol officers, that protect the film, protect the Oscars, direct traffic, provide security. Why would any police officer want to work with anyone who does not like police officers?\"\n\nCarl Dix, one of the New York rally's organizers, compares this boycott threat to what he calls \"a Mafia-style protection racket.\"\n\n\"Only the pay that they want isn't in cash but in toeing a political line - that if Tarantino and people like him want to be able to operate, do their art, they cannot criticize police brutality,\" Dix says.\n\nThere are shades of \"Hanoi Jane\" in all of this - with a Hollywood star becoming a symbol in a culture war. Only, instead of drumming up disagreements over the Vietnam War, as actress Jane Fonda's 1972 visit to North Vietnam did, the question here is whether American police are getting enough support - especially since the shooting in Ferguson.\n\nThat question is starting to crop up in politics, where presidential candidates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are raising the issue.\n\n\"The No. 1 job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and the security of the American people. This president has failed. And when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they have the support of the president of the United States,\" Christie said in the Republican presidential debate last week. \"That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.\"\n\nIt's not clear that Christie is gaining traction with his \"support the cops\" message, but political science professor Jeanne Zaino says she expects Christie won't be the last to use it.\n\n\"It seems to have found support amongst the Republican primary caucus-goers, and I think that we're gonna probably hear more rather than less of that.\"\n\nShe sees some parallels between the police boycott of Tarantino and some of the recent tactics on the other side of the debate - for instance, when Black Lives Matter activists interrupted Hillary Clinton during a speech. Activists have criticized Clinton for not embracing their point of view closely enough.\n\nZaino says there's an uncompromising tone that threatens to undermine the possibility of constructive political debate.\n\n\"Both of these groups don't seem to be allowing for that type of cooperation. And yet if you get into a stance where it's a winner-take-all kind of thing, you could run into a problem of not getting any reform at all.\"\n\nAnd she says that kind of polarization could jeopardize America's recent moves toward bipartisan cooperation - rare bipartisan cooperation - on criminal justice reform.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "< Still Reinventing At 80, Jane Fonda Says, 'I Feel Better Than I Ever Have'\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Jane Fonda has lived many lives from starlet to fitness guru to Vietnam protester and now a comedic actress, securing roles at an age when most people in Hollywood have left the screen. A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now.

They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss.

FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me.

The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO.

I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J.

And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J.

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J.

And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising...

The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah.

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization.

The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to?

      "text": "< Still Reinventing At 80, Jane Fonda Says, 'I Feel Better Than I Ever Have'\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Jane Fonda has lived many lives from starlet to fitness guru to Vietnam protester and now a comedic actress, securing roles at an age when most people in Hollywood have left the screen. A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J.

J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy.

SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen.

J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981.

FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising...

And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do.

I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J.

I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nJ. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets.

But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization.

The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea.

I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph).

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea.

SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to?

A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

A new documentary on HBO is called \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\" Our co-host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When I asked Jane Fonda about the transformations she's gone through in her 80 years, she recalled a conversation she had with her daughter two decades ago. JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry...

SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

JANE FONDA: I said, would you help me, you know, make a video of my life, a real short one? And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And she said, why don't you just get a chameleon to crawl across the screen? Ouch. She knew what buttons to push. And she wasn't wrong. SHAPIRO: Part of Jane Fonda's fame comes from the fact that she's pushed a lot of people's buttons over the years, including President Richard Nixon. That was after she visited North Vietnam, posed in a photo with a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun and got the nickname Hanoi Jane. The film begins with an excerpt from the Nixon tapes. And Jane Fonda told me she has heard this so many times over the decades she practically has it memorized. J. FONDA: What's the matter with Jane Fonda? I feel so sorry... (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") RICHARD NIXON: So sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. J. FONDA: She's a good actress. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J.

SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you.

And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She's a great actress. J. FONDA: She looks good. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman.

One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me.

SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"JANE FONDA IN FIVE ACTS\") NIXON: She looks pretty but, boy, she's often on the wrong track. J. FONDA: But she sure has taken a wrong path. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization.

(LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: What does that represent to you? J. FONDA: I'm here, and he's not (laughter). SHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true.

FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor.

J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. J. FONDA: I mean, I feel bad that he felt that way, but I can laugh about it now. And I think it's a great way to begin this documentary. SHAPIRO: You have told your own story before in a memoir. You allowed someone else to tell this story for you. You did not direct or executive produce this film. J. FONDA: Right. I never saw it until it was all done. And I think it was really smart that she divided it the way she did, into these five acts. SHAPIRO: She of course being Susan Lacy, the director. J. FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: Susan Lacy, who created American Masters at PBS and has now moved to HBO. The four acts being the men in my life, my father and then my three husbands, and then the fifth act is Jane. And it's kind of - becomes a gender journey more clearly that way. SHAPIRO: The first major male influence on your life was your father, the great actor Henry Fonda. And you describe him as emotionally open and authentic on screen but distant in real life. And you finally found a way to bridge that gap on film with the movie \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Hello, Norman. HENRY FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health.

There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) Happy birthday. H. FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen.

FONDA: (Norman Thayer Jr.) Look at you. Look at this little fat girl, Ethel. SHAPIRO: And there's this one scene where you and your father playing father and daughter have this heartfelt conversation. And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

And in the film, you reveal something that you had planned for this scene without telling him. J. FONDA: Well, he hated emotion. Emotion terrified him, which is pretty interesting in an actor. And I did something that we had not rehearsed that I hoped would bring some emotion up. And I reached out, and I touched his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ON GOLDEN POND\") J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I want to be your friend. H. FONDA: (As Norman Thayer Jr.) Oh. This mean you'll come around more often? Mean a lot to your mother. J. FONDA: (As Chelsea Thayer Wayne) I'll come around more often. And he ducks his head, and he reaches his hand up to cover his eyes. But before that, I could see his eyes well up. I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising...

One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

I cry every time I see it. I cry so hard. It was so hard for me to do. SHAPIRO: And when the cameras stopped rolling, were you ever able to have a conversation about what that had opened up? J. FONDA: Well, I tried. I asked if I could come over for dinner where he and his wife, Shirlee, were staying on location. And they had me over. And I described what doing the scene had meant to me. And I asked him if - you know, if he could relate to any of that. He said no. (LAUGHTER) J. FONDA: But you know something? One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot.

One of the great things about getting older - if you've bothered to really examine your life and really figure out who your parents were, you come to the realization as I did with my father that it's not that he didn't love me. He just didn't know how to express it. But he did the best he could. And I was able to forgive him. And I love him so much. And I miss him a lot. SHAPIRO: When I told my mother that I was going to be interviewing you - and I'm sure you've heard this from probably thousands of women over the years - she said, Jane Fonda made me comfortable exercising 'cause I didn't want to go out in public to a gym in front of people, but I was OK putting the videotape in my VCR at home and exercising... J. FONDA: Right. SHAPIRO: ...With Jane. J. FONDA: Oh. SHAPIRO: How did that become part of your identity? Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

Where did you learn the routines that you became so famous for? J. FONDA: I learned the routine - the original routine from a woman named Lenny Kasdan (ph). And I turned it into a business because at the time Tom Hayden, my second husband, and I had started a statewide organization in California called the California Campaign for Economic Democracy. And I said, I got to start a business that can fund the organization. And it was the workout. All the money went to the Campaign for Economic Democracy. SHAPIRO: I had no idea. I assumed that you got rich off of these videotapes, and actually it all went to fund this nonprofit. J. FONDA: Yeah. Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that. SHAPIRO: You have so many projects going on right now from \"Grace And Frankie,\" the wonderful Netflix comedy, to rumors - or are they more than rumors? - of \"9 To 5,\" the seminal movie, coming back with many members of the original cast. J. FONDA: Well, we have writers working on a script for a sequel with a very funny premise. And I'm hoping it will happen because guess what? It needs to happen. The issues and offices for women today are even worse than they were back in the day when we made the original. SHAPIRO: Even worse - that's interesting to hear you say. J. FONDA: Yeah. There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

There are several reasons. Sexual harassment is not abating in offices. But today many people in all kinds of jobs, not just office workers - they're not beholden to the boss. They're hired by another company and then subcontracted to the company where they work so if they're fired because of pregnancy or there's wage theft or sexual harassment, who do they go to? I mean, it's just a catastrophe. And we want to try to hit all that and still have it be really funny. SHAPIRO: You are constantly working and on screen today. You seem to be in great health. And as we talk about this \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts\" documentary, I wonder what you've learned about this final act and what you want to get out of it. J. FONDA: Well, one thing I've learned is in order to know where you're going, you have to know where you've been. One thing I knew is I did not want to die the way my father did. He died with regrets. I live, I am happy to say, a very examined life. And one of the things I hope that people will take away from my documentary is the value of an examined life. You know, you don't become wise by having a lot of experience. You become wise by reflecting deeply on the experiences that you've had. And that's what I've tried to do. And it's made all the difference to me in my life now at 80 years - I'm almost 81, and I feel better than I ever have. I know that sounds preposterous, but it's true. SHAPIRO: Jane Fonda, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Thanks so much. J. FONDA: I appreciate it very much. Love the show.

Eventually I bought it back after three or four years because I wanted to grow the business, and I couldn't because all the dividends were going out to the organization. But it was an important organization, and the money really made a difference. It was terrific. I'm very proud of that.

      "text": "Jane Fonda in Five Acts Is a Candid Portrait of a Hollywood Truth-Teller\n\nI n retrospect, it probably wasn't the best idea for Jane Fonda to appear as one of the first guests on NBC's Megyn Kelly Today last fall. Fresh off the politics beat, Kelly was still getting a feel for light morning-show chitchat when she asked the actress about her plastic surgery. Fonda blinked in disbelief: \"We really want to talk about that now?\" The moment was classic Jane Fonda: Instead of chatting about her face when she'd been invited to discuss her latest film, the Oscar winner let Kelly, the studio audience and viewers across America all witness her genuine reaction. Then 79, Fonda seemed entirely comfortable showing off the candor she'd spent decades cultivating in the public eye.\n\nThough it's shaped by her relationships with four famous men-her father, Hollywood legend Henry Fonda, and three ex-husbands: filmmaker Roger Vadim, activist Tom Hayden and media mogul Ted Turner-the real through-line in Jane Fonda in Five Acts is this same bracing honesty. Directed and produced by American Masters creator Susan Lacy, the 133-minute documentary, which will air Sept. 24 on HBO, takes its time excavating Fonda's life. There is, of course, a lot of ground to cover: Famous since birth, she evolved from a wholesome girl-next-door type into a sex symbol, a polarizing dissident and then the doyenne of exercise. In the 21st century, Fonda's persona combines all of these identities, and only one word seems to sum up her place in the culture: icon.\n\nLacy unearths a trove of fascinating archival footage from every era of this remarkable life and wrings insightful commentary out of the story's most important supporting characters, including Hayden (who died in 2016), Turner, Redford and Fonda's equally plain-spoken pal Lily Tomlin. But what the film's leisurely pace really does is make ample space for Fonda's unvarnished reflections. Rather than linger on her achievements and scandals, which are already well documented in the annals of cinema and celebrity gossip, Lacy's interviews provide a glimpse of what it's like to actually be a person as legendary and complicated as Jane Fonda.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem diminishing to structure a documentary about a talented, accomplished woman-especially one who vocally identifies as a feminist-around the men in her life. But it allows Lacy to trace her subject's slow evolution from a product of patriarchy into an independent human being. Growing up in the spotlight, Fonda survived her mother's suicide and craved the approval of her critical, often absent father. Those rarely discussed experiences shaped the person she became. Lacy is patient with the central story of Jane, her mentally ill mother and her first child, Vanessa Vadim, allowing it to spill from one act into the next, guided by the star's hard-won epiphanies about how her sad upbringing poisoned her earliest attempts at motherhood.\n\nAlthough it also goes on to address all of the obligatory controversies, from Barbarella to Hanoi Jane, Five Acts is more interested in what Fonda has gleaned from 80 years of immersion in radical ideas and intense relationships-and the approach only works because of her openness. For Fonda, each of her parents is a reflection of the best and worst parts of herself; every marriage represents both an education and a reinvention, a stop on her path to discovering an authentic self. When \"Act Five: Jane\" finally flashes across the screen, the movie's triumphant denouement feels earned.\n\nAs seen through Lacy's compassionate lens, the Jane Fonda who lays bare her life in Five Acts is introspective and affable, confident yet forthcoming about her flaws and failures, earnest in her devotion to her various causes but also wickedly funny when she wants to be. (On Vadim: \"He didn't speak very good English. Maybe if he had I never would've married him.\") Such candor is hard to find in biographical documentaries, let alone ones about Hollywood stars. In fact, Fonda's honesty even extends to a brief word about plastic surgery. But do we really wanna talk about that now?\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

Back when I was a kid that was OK, as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character.\"\n\nShe then defended a reality television show star who drew ire last year for darkening her skin and donning an afro wig to dress as Diana Ross.\n\n\"Who doesn't love Diana Ross? She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day? I don't know how that got racist on Halloween,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe backlash was immediate: the anchor was accused of being tone-deaf and ignorant to racial sensitivities.\n\nIncredulous viewers shared videos of the segment on social media, pointing out the well-known history of degrading depictions of African-Americans using blackface throughout US history.\n\nKelly apologised to NBC staff internally and then publicly to viewers on the Wednesday edition of her show.\n\nBut questions are being asked about whether the career of one of the highest paid news stars in the US can, or should, recover.\n\nKelly joined Fox News in 2004, with little previous experience as a reporter.\n\nBorn in 1970 in upstate New York, Kelly was the youngest of three children of a college professor father and a mother who worked as a nurse at a veterans' hospital.\n\nA keen cheerleader in high school, she went on to study political science at Syracuse University before qualifying as a lawyer in Albany, New York and practising as an associate in a law firm for about a decade.\n\nShe then decided to switch careers and made a demo tape that got her work as a reporter for a local ABC affiliate in Washington DC, before bagging a job at Fox News about a year later.\n\nJonathan Klein, former head of CNN US, told the New York Times in 2015 he regretted not signing her to his own network : \"If you'd have asked me who was the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else, from another network, I would have said - and did - Megyn Kelly.\"\n\nIn 2010 Kelly got her first solo spot presenting Fox's America Live. She was credited by the network's then-head Roger Ailes for improving ratings, especially among younger audiences.\n\nShe was known for her unique and tough interviewing style, upper-cutting guests with a sharp line of questioning that would often leave them scrambling for a response.\n\nAs an anchor she courted controversy, especially from the left, with her coverage. In 2013 she made headlines after declaring Santa Claus had to be depicted as a white man.\n\n\"And by the way, for all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,\" Kelly said on the show. \"Jesus was a white man, too... He was a historical figure, that's a verifiable fact, as is Santa. I just want the kids watching to know that.\"\n\nThe segment drew ridicule - and Kelly later said she regretted the comments, as well as other \"stupid [expletive]\" she said while at Fox.\n\nHer profile soared spectacularly in 2016 after she sparred with Donald Trump during a Republican primary debate.\n\n\"You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,\" she challenged the candidate.\n\nMr Trump fired back - labelling the question inappropriate and criticising Kelly in several interviews, including one where he seemed to suggest menstruation was to blame.\n\n\"There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,\" he told CNN.\n\nAfter Fox News CEO Roger Ailes was sued by other women at the network for alleged harassment, Kelly came forward with her own allegations against him in her 2016 memoir.\n\nDespite an apparently more lucrative offer from Fox to keep her, Kelly announced her departure for NBC at the start of 2017 .\n\nShe was given the 09:00 morning slot for Megyn Kelly Today - a magazine news programme spliced with lifestyle and celebrity segments, and recorded live in front of a live studio audience.\n\nIt was a sharp pivot from her previous role, and the show was panned by critics who found Kelly's transformation less than convincing.\n\nThe rocky start worsened when actress Debra Messing said she regretted appearing on the show after Kelly asked a Will and Grace fan whether he had \"became gay\" because of its influence.\n\nViewing figures continued to be lower than those enjoyed by the show's previous hosts.\n\nKelly then got into a very public feud with another guest, actress Jane Fonda, over an interview where she pressed her on her history of plastic surgery.\n\nIn January this year, Kelly escalated the feud in a three-minute monologue where she brought up the actress's record of protesting against US involvement in Vietnam and the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\".\n\nNBC staff told the Washington Post newspaper that colleagues had become fed up with Kelly well before the blackface controversy.\n\nHer other NBC slot, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, only aired eight times and has not been broadcast since July 2017.\n\nThe new row has led to previous comments she made when covering racially charged topics at Fox being brought back up, including one report where she described black communities of having an \"anti-cop... thug mentality\".\n\n\"This is not Megyn's first go-around with racially tinged talk. We know her history; we've watched her on Fox, stirring up political divisiveness and animosity,\" former ESPN vice-head Roxanne Jones wrote for CNN .\n\nKelly has now parted ways with her talent agent and there are strong rumours in US media that NBC is in negotiations to pay off the rest of her rumoured $69m (£54m) contract.\n\nCould a return to Fox be on the cards?

But Mr. Newsom, looking longingly at the Oval Office, may regret his association with Ms. Fonda.

      "text": "After Uproar, LA County Moves Jane Fonda Day to April 8\n\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has moved Jane Fonda Day to April 8 from the previously proclaimed date of April 30, after backlash from critics and Vietnamese Americans upset over the date's overlap with the fall of Saigon.\n\nSouth Vietnam's 1975 fall to communist North Vietnam, known as Black April, is observed on April 30 and is a solemn occasion for veterans of that war and the 521,100-\r\nstrong Vietnamese population in California.\n\nThe board issued its original Jane Fonda Day proclamation on April 30, with the actress and environmental activist attending to be recognized for her work on behalf of women, the environment and human rights. But the move was quickly met with criticism over her outspoken opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and her trip to North Vietnam in 1972.\n\nAssemblyman Tri Ta, a Westminster Republican, called on the Board of Supervisors May 8 to rescind the proclamation. He also wrote a letter signed by more than a dozen other legislators and sent to Board of Supervisors Chair Lindsey Horvath, saying, \"The pain and hurt caused by this decision will surely cause long-term damage to the Vietnamese refugee community.\"\n\nSen. Janet Nguyen, a Huntington Beach Republican, wrote a letter to Horvath calling the decision \"alarming\" and \"profoundly disrespectful.\"\n\nThe letter called Fonda a \"propagandist who supported a communist agenda in Vietnam,\" noting that the actress was infamously labeled \"Hanoi Jane\" by the community after her trip to North Vietnam, where she was photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun. The move was criticized as anti-American and pro-communist.\n\nFonda later apologized, saying the photographs were a \"thoughtless and careless thing to have done.\"\n\nResponding to the criticism, Ms. Horvath and Supervisor Hilda Solis jointly introduced a motion to move the date.\n\nA representative for Horvath told the Los Angeles Times the selection of the original date of April 30 was made solely based on the board's meeting schedule."

See, e.g., their refusal to abandon Lech Walesa and his trade unionists in JPII's Poland; Reagan's walk-out in Reykjavic over Gorby's insistence that the U.S. shut down its missile shield system (which today's leftists were then dismissing as \"Star Wars\"); and their unyielding support for freedom in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Albania, Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.  So sure: \"we should celebrate\" the fact that Gorby did in the end \"get it 100% right\" -- he did finally \"Take down this wall!\"  But let's also give a hat tip to the man who demanded he do so -- and to both the Iron Lady and the Saint who backed that demand to the hilt.\n\nRed States have the highest obesity rates and chronic illnesses in the entire U.S. They are not filled with expert survivalists, military strategists, MacGyvers and Rambos. Lived in Red States 95% of my life. They can hunt, drink beer, complain about the \"coloreds\" and Liberals, and cheer on their football teams. Lol. I don't know where this \"Daniel Boone\" fantasy about Red State people came from....wait....probably them.\n\nThere is no \"kid herding cattle\" in West Texas anymore. Agriculture today is mechanized/automated and run by Fortune 500 Agribusinesses. The only ones doing labor are seasonal migrant farmer laborers. They same ones Red State people hate so much.\n\nAlso, your coal miner has COPD and black lung disease. He also probably has chronic back pain and is addicted to Oxycontin.\n\nOh...along with COPD and black lung disease, your coal miner also probably has chronic back pain and is addicted to Oxycontin.\n\nRed States have the highest obesity rates and chronic illnesses in the country. There is no kid \"handling cattle\" in West Texas anymore. All your coal miners have black lung disease and COPD.\n\nAgriculture is completely automated/mechanized and owned by big companies. The only ones doing labor are undocumented migrant farm laborers.\n\nJoe Biden does not have to apologize. He did not \"slander tens of millions of Americans by calling them fascist\".\n\nHe only called one man and his henchmen \"fascist\" and quite rightfully so.\n\nIn 1932 close to 12 million Germans voted for the German Nazi Party. These people weren't all genuine Nazis. A lot of them were only way too naiv and shortsighted to realize who and what they were really voting for. Part of their problem was that they did not take serious what Hitler told them about his intentions upfront, especially how he saw democracy, only as a means to get into power and then destroy it to stay in power. Trump's first attempt to do so in the US only narrowly failed and now he's laying the groundwork to finish American democracy off by eliminating those Republicans who were principled enough to stand their ground for democracy and not allow Trump to steal the last election and replacing them with spineless puppets who will do what they are told to when push comes to shove.\n\nWith Trump's voters it's quite a similar story as with Hitler's. It's not that Trump hides his intentions to do way with American democracy, just like Hitler did not make a secret out of his plan to destroy German democracy back in the day. And as well as too many Germans voted for their menace too many Americans will vote for their's. Trump won't need a majority to win the next presidential election. He'll  just need a big enough minority for his henchmen to cheat it into a majority and that will be the end of America as we know it.....\n\nBiden and the Democrats are literally subverting democracy as I write this. They misuse their power to search and seize, they use their power to censor dissenting voices on social media, they vilify their opponents in the most ugly terms. Soon they will be calling republicans rats.\n\nWho is more of a threat? The ones in power or the ones not in power? A little common sense here. Maybe you should be looking for parallels between Hitler and Biden. It would be more relevant.\n\nRemember that the left in this country is always doing what it accuses the right of doing. Biden's speech is terrifying because of the accusations and what it means he and the Democrats are actively doing right now.\n\nYou seem to suggest that the chaos in Portland is inevitable and could not have been precluded by basic competent governance which seems in short supply  there.\n\nYour take on politics reflects your total bias, but also lack of education on the issues. No, not issues like abortion, but rather how special elections and rank choice voting work. Be careful offering opinions on things you quite clearly don't understand.\n\nOh wait, he did. Then the Cino imbecile forgot and the next day he said he didn't. I'm sorry but your emperor has no clothes. Pathetic fool\n\nI say we take this limbo stick down a notch! Meghan you knocked it out of the limbo park this week! (Which might be a bad thing to do, now that I think about it...)\n\nThanks, Meghan! Great work!\n\nExcellent job, Meghan! Loved your article!\n\nFirst time reader of your work, Meghan--thank you! I gave up legacy media a long time ago and patch together other voices when I have time. Currently my time is spent teaching young Americans how to read, write, and think critically. The first piece we worked on in Rhetoric was Bari's Resignation Letter!\n\nIn a parallel universe, every college senior would be made to read Bari's resignation letter as a graduation requirement.\n\nVery nice to have you here...I look forward to return visits.\n\nThinking further about Diablo Canyon, and especially Germany and the Greens insisting on shutting down nuclear, and as a result scrambling to reopen coal fired power plants.\n\nI'd like for some enterprising journalist to go interview Hanoi Jane Fonda and ask her how she feels about the reality that the demonization of nuclear that she lead is now moving into the inevitable consequences of more and more co2 emissions in the west and the whole world.\n\nBecause that is the only way civilization continues with no nuclear.\n\nThrow it right in her face and film the reaction as it dawns on her what she's done.\n\nThen post it around the world."

Reports surfaced that staff at \"Today\" weren't all that thrilled about the idea of Megyn joining their team.\n\nMany of her so-called \"colleagues\" have taken jabs at Megyn openly , and one staffer was even fired for claiming the environment was \" toxic and demeaning \" for lower level staff.\n\nDeborah Messing, who appeared on \"Megyn Kelly Today\" for a  \"Will and Grace\" reboot, also badmouthed the host after her appearance on \"Today\" when a fan asked Messing a question about the interview on Instagram in which Messing replied she was \"dismayed\" and regretted the appearance.\n\nIn another interview between Megyn and Jane Fonda, Fonda purposely attempted to make Megyn look like a fool during an interview in which Megyn praised her for her looks but brought up plastic surgery. A topic Fonda has never shied away from, but suddenly was off limits for Megyn.\n\nFonda later went on to criticize Megyn for the interview to anyone who would listen.\n\nFinally, on Monday's episode of \"Megyn Kelly Today,\" Megyn addressed the malice perpetrated by Fonda following the interview in a scathing monologue which reduced Fonda to a mere hypocrite fixated on the faux sanctimonious causes championed by the 80-year-old.\n\nMegyn also reminded viewers of Fonda's anti-military past calling her by her nickname \" Hanoi Jane ,\" which refers to Fonda's betrayal of America's military.\n\n\"Honestly, she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive,\" said Megyn.\n\nWatch above.\n\nTo see more from Pat, visit his channel on TheBlaze and listen live to \"Pat Gray Unleashed\" with Pat Gray weekdays 12 p.m. - 3 p.m. ET, only on TheBlaze Radio Network .\n\nBlazeTV Staff"

As a result of the backlash, Griffin lost a hosting job at CNN, received death threats, and was purportedly investigated by the Secret Service.\n\n\"I'm Hanoi Jane, you know? I get it. This photo is gonna be with me forever, no matter what I do,\" the actress and comedienne said in March. \"I was in London a month ago and I had a driver who took myself and my assistant from London Heathrow to the hotel, and he recognized me from the photo and he said that he was from Morocco and that if we were in Morocco he would cut my tongue off.

April 30 is not the day.'\n\nNguyen was left outraged by leaders of LA County over the move to rename the day for Fonda, and immediately began pressuring leaders.\n\nTri Ta, a member of the California State Assembly, was equally disgusted after learning of the move.\n\nTa and his fellow assembly member Stephanie Nguyen wrote a letter signed by almost every Republican member urging officials to backtrack on the decision.\n\nTheir letter said: 'This honor for Ms. Fonda is an affront to the service and sacrifice of American and South Vietnamese soldiers who gave everything in the cause of freedom.'\n\nTa told Cal Matters: 'I was really, really upset because [Black April] is a really sad day for almost every Vietnamese American here.'\n\nFonda at the Hammer Museum's Gala in the Garden held at The Hammer Museum on May 4, 2024 in Los Angeles\n\nHorvath, left, presents Jane Fonda with a proclamation that April 30th is \"Jane Fonda Day\" in Los Angeles County\n\nOn Friday, LA County officials announced they would be changing the date, saying in a statement: 'Out of respect for the community voices who have spoken up, we will introduce a motion at our next regular meeting of the Board to make Jane Fonda Day April 8 as part of Earth Month.'\n\nJust the week before, Lindsey P. Horvath, Chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors welcomed Fonda to a board meeting to celebrate the move.\n\nShe said: 'Jane Fonda's activism knows no bounds. Where Jane focuses her passion and heart, great things happen.\n\n'Starting today, we proudly proclaim April 30th each year as 'Jane Fonda Day' in Los Angeles County, in recognition of her incredible contributions to entertainment, environmental sustainability, gender equality, and social justice.\n\n'Let's continue to engage in service and advocacy for social and environmental justice, following Jane Fonda's example of using our voices to make a difference in the lives of others, and protect our planet today and for future generations.'\n\nIn accepting it, Fonda said: 'This is so beautiful, I am so honored and grateful. Thank you to Lindsey and the Board of Supervisors.\n\n'I am kind of blown away, I cannot believe there is a Jane Fonda day. This is wonderful, thank you very much.'\n\nIn this file photo two U.S. Marines support a wounded soldier as they leave a building which came under attack, February 6, 1968 in South Vietnam\n\nThe body of a slain comrade is carried to an evacuation helicopter by soldiers of the U.S. 1st cavalry division in the Ia Drang Valley early in the week of Nov. 15, 1965\n\nFonda has repeatedly apologized for the pictures of her with the anti-aircraft guns, saying her actions were in protest of the US Government and not US troops.\n\nIn addressing the infamous picture in her 2005 memoir 'My Life So Far', she said: 'Someone leads me toward the gun, and I sit down, still laughing, still applauding.\n\n'It all has nothing to do with where I am sitting. I hardly even think about where I am sitting.\n\n'The cameras flash. I get up, and as I start to walk back to the car with the translator, the implication of what has just happened hits me.\n\n'Oh, my God. It's going to look like I was trying to shoot down U.S. planes! I plead with him, \"You have to be sure those photographs are not published. Please, you can't let them be published.\"\n\n'I am assured it will be taken care of. I don't know what else to do. It is possible that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know.\n\n'If they did, can I really blame them? The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen. It was my mistake, and I have paid and continue to pay a heavy price for it.'\n\nIn 2015, 50 veterans protested her appearance at the Weinberg Center for the Arts in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nThe large group held up signs that said 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget? Never'. Fonda later told the crowd: 'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

We have to, have to, have to get [Harris and Walz] elected,' Fonda, dressed in a pinstriped gray suit, told the woman.\n\nThe pair shared an embrace as the resident held back tears before thanking the Fonda for the visit.\n\nDespite the Michigander's warmth, not all were happy to see Fonda's activism - with many still taking offense to her controversial stance on the Vietnam War in the 1970s, where she actively called for the war's end and even traveled to the country.\n\nFonda got the nickname 'Hanoi Jane' after she was pictured sitting on an antiaircraft gun during a 1972 trip to North Vietnam, an image that still haunts her to this day and one she spoke about in her 2005 memoir, My Life So Far.\n\nThe 86-year-old activist was featured in a video posted by Kamala for Michigan greeting a resident of Ann Arbor and asking for the woman's support\n\n'I've never done it for a president, but this is most important.

Congress also held a hearing, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars called for her to be prosecuted as a traitor, according to the Washington Post .\n\nFonda continued to speak out into 1973.\n\nShe has continuously apologized for the Hanoi photo, including giving a detailed explanation in her 2005 memoir, where she admitted she didn't realize the 'implication of what has just happened' until it was too late.\n\nNot all were happy to see Fonda's activism - with many still taking offense to her controversial stance on the Vietnam War in the 1970s, where she actively called for the war's end and even traveled to the country\n\nThe actress was invited to the war-torn country to tour its dike system, which was rumored to have been bombed by US forces - something the US denies.

Shameful.'\n\nThere was support for Kelly too, with lawyer and columnist Kurt Schlicter responding to Messing's tweet by writing: 'Maybe you should prioritize American heroes, like VADM James Stockdale, who were tortured and sometimes murdered by the communist bastards Hanoi Jane cavorted with, over your Hollywood traitor pal.'\n\nThis could be just the response Kelly wants though in hopes that it might be able to drive up ratings on her show, which after a recent uptick is slowly starting to drop again over the past week.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nDrama: Megyn Kelly is under fire, with celebs criticizing comments she made about Jane Fonda on Monday morning (Kelly leaving work on Monday)\n\nBurn: 'Megyn Kelly is a moron - spineless wanna be barbie - she sucks and so does her show,' wrote Rosie O'Donnell\n\nOn the attack: Megyn Kelly (above on Monday) tore into Jane Fonda for repeatedly criticizing her over a plastic surgery question she asked the actress, 80, back in September\n\nLetting loose: 'Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam war, many of our veterans still call her \"Hanoi Jane\" ... for shaming troops,' said Kelly (Fonda above in Vietnam)\n\nIt has been four months since Megyn Kelly earned the wrath and ire of Jane Fonda for asking the 80-year-old actress about her plastic surgery, and the NBC host is now responding to the backlash.\n\nThat moment occurred during Kelly's third episode on September 27 when she asked the Oscar-winner about what work she had done in the past, which prompted a steely Fonda to stare Kelly down and ask: 'We really want to talk about that now?'\n\nSince then Fonda has complained about the question to a number of outlets, and even mocked Kelly's question on Today last week during an interview with Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb\n\n'When she first complained publicly after the program, and repeatedly, I chose to say nothing, as my general philosophy is what other people think of me is none of my business,' said Megyn at the end of her program on Monday.\n\n'However, Fonda was at it again last week, including right here on NBC, and then again elsewhere. So it's time to address the poor-me routine.'\n\n'First, some context. Fonda was on to promote a film about aging. For years she has spoken openly about her joy in giving a cultural face to older women,' Kelly told her studio audience.\n\n'Well the truth is most older women look nothing like Fonda, who is now 80. And if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women's cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore.'\n\nShe continued: 'Fonda herself knows this. She knows this. And that is why, to her credit, she's discussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show.'\n\nKelly went on to list the many outlets that Fonda has complained to along with the many outlets to which she has previously discussed her plastic surgery.\n\nToday was one of them, with Lily Tomlin joking last week during an interview with Kotb and Guthrie about how long she had known Fonda by stating: 'Oh, my God...I think before your first facelift!'\n\nFonda shot back: 'Who are you, Megyn Kelly?'\n\nAt the moment, all four women erupted in laughter, and the exchange was later posted on social media.\n\n'Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift question, read the caption.\n\nKelly does not seem to be laughing however in the wake of that interview.\n\n'Look, I gave her the chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well and she rejected it. That's okay. But I have no regrets about the question,' explained Kelly.\n\n'Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage.'\n\nThat is when Kelly launched into Fox News mode.\n\n'Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam war, many of our veterans still call her \"Hanoi Jane\" thanks to her radio broadcasts which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots,' stated Kelly.\n\n'She called our POW's \"hypocrites and liars\" and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture - but not for the rest of it.'\n\nShe then closed out by saying: 'By the way she still says she's not proud of America. So, the moral indignation is a little much. She put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.'\n\nKelly's claim is inaccurate however, with Fonda apologizing directly to a group of Vietnam veterans in 2015 while appearing at an event in Maryland.\n\n'Whenever possible I try to sit down with vets and talk with them, because I understand and it makes me sad,' Fonda told those assembled at the Weinberg Center for Arts according to The Frederick News-Post .\n\n'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'\n\nShe later described herself as a 'lightening rod' to many, like to 50 protesters outside the venue that evening who carried signs reading: 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget? Never.'\n\nFonda then explained: 'This famous person goes and does something that looks like I'm against the troops, which wasn't true, but it looked that way, and I'm a convenient target. So I understand.'\n\nShe would not say however she regretted travelling to North Vietnam.\n\nJane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift comment pic.twitter.com/2qUUxReqiy\n\nOh no she did not: Fonda (above in September after being asked about her plastic surgery) had recently spoken about the question in an interview with Variety and on Today last week\n\nGoing hard: ''She called our POW's \"hypocrites and liars\" and referred to their torture as understandable,' Kelly said of Fonda (above in image on set)\n\nGrudge match: Kelly failed to mention that she herself had run multiple segments on her Fox News show The Kelly File which were highly critical on Fonda (pair above in September)\n\nViewers of The Kelly File might recognize these comments from episodes of the host's Fox News program.\n\nIn at least three videos from 2014, Kelly welcomed guests on her program to trash Jane Fonda while also taking some shots of her own at the Oscar winner.\n\nIn one interview with Dennis Miller in June of that year, Kelly smiled while saying that 'things went south' for the actress after her role in 'Barbarella.'\n\nShe continued to laugh as Miller said that Fonda 'made sense' to him when she played the the title character in that film, a voluptuous space traveler from the planet Earth who spent most of her time in little to no clothing.\n\nThose comments were made in response to her actions during the Vietnam War.\n\n'She's not beloved by a large portion of Americans,' said Kelly in that interview.\n\nJust a few months before Kelly and Miller went after Fonda in 2014, the host also called out then-first lady Michelle Obama for saying she admired the actress' political savvy.\n\n'The thing is, if she had just said I want to have a body like Jane Fonda when I'm 76 most women would say, \"yeah, me too,'' said Kelly.\n\n'But when she named the political savvy and said she was someone she wanted to live like she crossed over into territory where people would criticize her.'\n\nJane Fonda was one of the most public faces in the anti-war movement throughout the years that the United States was in Vietnam, but drew the outrage of many in 1972 when she traveled to Hanoi in North Vietnam.\n\nAfter touring the area and being heavily photographed with the forces that the US were fighting, Fonda publicly attacked her country for bombing farmland and destroying the dyke system which was crucial to feeding much of the population.\n\nThe United States denied ever carrying out such an action.\n\nFonda on an antiaircraft gun that would have been used to shoot down and destroy American planes before taking any surviving servicemen captives as POWs\n\nIt was the photograph of Fonda on an antiaircraft gun that would have been used to shoot down and destroy American planes before taking any surviving servicemen captives as POWs that truly angered millions, and is still a great source of outrage for some veterans.\n\nCongress later held hearings to decide if Fonda should be punished for her actions, with many calling her trip an act of treason and the actress a traitor.\n\nFonda recounted the trip in her memoir\n\nAt the same time, false reports began to surface also claiming that Fonda spoke with POWs in North Vietnam and relayed the information they shared with her to enemy troops.\n\nFonda wrote about the infamous antiaircraft gun photo in her 2005 memoir My Life So Far .\n\n'Someone (I don't remember who) leads me toward the gun, and I sit down, still laughing, still applauding. It all has nothing to do with where I am sitting. I hardly even think about where I am sitting,' said Fonda.\n\n'The cameras flash. I get up, and as I start to walk back to the car with the translator, the implication of what has just happened hits me. Oh, my God. It's going to look like I was trying to shoot down U.S. planes! I plead with him, You have to be sure those photographs are not published. Please, you can't let them be published.'\n\nShe went on to write: 'I am assured it will be taken care of. I don't know what else to do. It is possible that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. If they did, can I really blame them? The buck stops here.\n\n'If I was used, I allowed it to happen. It was my mistake, and I have paid and continue to pay a heavy price for it.'\n\nIn what looked at the time to be an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, Kelly decided to ask the actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the year back in September.\n\n'You, you've been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength. And unapologetically,' began Kelly, nervously drawing out her question.\n\n'You admit you had work done. I think it's to your credit. You look amazing. Have you ... why did you say .. I read you felt you're not proud to admit you had work done, why not?'\n\nThat is when Fonda asked why they were discussing the subject.\n\nKelly tried her best to salvage the question, with Fonda at that point glancing over to her guest Robert Redford in disbelief that she was being asked that question while out promoting the pair's new film, 'Our Souls at Night.'\n\n'Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you, is how amazing you look,' said Kelly.\n\nA composed-as-ever but noticeably chilly Fonda at that point demurred: 'Thanks. Good attitude. Good posture. Take care of myself.'\n\nShe then took control of the interview from Kelly by telling the host: 'Let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, \"Our Souls at Night,\" rather than plastic surgery.'\n\nRedford then looked at his co-star and showed his support for her by laughing and saying: 'Back to that, huh.'\n\nFonda then launched into her own talk about the film, no longer waiting or wanting to take one of Kelly's questions.\n\n'You kind of have a choice in life, when you get to be close to 80, or even before then, what you want to do with your life. And my character, Addie, in this movie, she knows there's a lot more time behind her than in front,' explained Fonda.\n\n'And she doesn't want to go down lonely and scared. She's been a widow, living in this house by herself. And she's lonely and scared. And she's a shy person, who is not someone who would normally do this. But she girds her loins and decides...'\n\nRedford jumped in saying: 'That's where I come in. You need to be girded.'\n\nHeard it all before: Kelly previously had a similar discussion about Fonda with Dennis Miller on her Fox News show back in 2014 (above)\n\nRedford later sang the praises of his co-star, who he previously worked with on such films as 'Barefoot In the Park' and 'The Chase.'\n\n'One of the things I like about Jane that's manifest in this film, is she is a force. As long as I've known Jane, she always has been moving forward. And doesn't look back,' said Redford.\n\n'And whatever pain, whatever problem she's had in the past, remains in the past. And she keeps moving forward. It's an admirable quality. And few people have it like Jane does.'\n\nThe rest of the interview was a wash, with Kelly getting no response from Fonda when she launched into a bit about how she was an aerobics instructor for 10 years shortly after the actress released her bestselling exercise tapes.\n\nAnd to close it all out, Fonda drove home just how little she cared for Megyn's questions and how proud she was of her looks and how she has aged when the host asked her guests: 'On behalf of our audience member, Victoria wanted to ask, if you could go back to any age in your life, what would it be? I ask that to both of you.'\n\nFonda very curtly replied: 'Right now. I wouldn't want any other time.'\n\nThe actress has indeed spoken about procedures she has had done in the past, but only while promoting her fitness and wellness projects.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Jane Fonda in talks to play former first lady in upcoming movie The Butler\n\nBy RACHEL QUIGLEY\n\nPublished: 14:30 EDT, 27 March 2012 | Updated: 16:21 EDT, 27 March 2012\n\n73\n\nView comments\n\nOutspoken liberal actress Jane Fonda is in talks to play former first lady Nancy Reagan in the upcoming TV movie The Butler.\n\nPrecious director Lee Daniels is said to have the Oscar-winning actress in mind for the role, despite the fact her personal politics could not be any further from those that fueled the right-wing Reagan presidency between 1982 and 1989.\n\nThe Butler is a true story based on Eugene Allen, a White House employee who served as a butler to eight presidents, from Harry Truman in 1952 to Reagan in 1986 when segregation laws were still in place.\n\nHypocrisy? Jane Fonda's personal politics could not be any further from those that fueled the right-wing Reagan presidency between 1982 and 1989, as it is rumored she is in talks to play Nancy Reagan, left\n\nOscar winner Forest Whitaker is in talks to play Allen in the sprawling historical drama, though no casting deals are in place yet.\n\nVariety reported that Daniels had Fonda, whose outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War gave her the nick name Hanoi Jane, in mind for Nancy.\n\nIn the 1970s, the actress supported both the militant Black Panther organization and the campaign for Native American civil rights while she denounced the Vietnam war.\n\nConservative bloggers are already up in arms over what they are calling stunt casting and some are even calling for a boycott of the movie.\n\nA photo dated 25 July 1972 shows Jane Fonda visiting Hanoi: Her opposition to the Vietnam War has continued to enrage Conservatives for years\n\nBacklash: Conservative bloggers and internet commenters are calling the choice stunt casting as they say Fonda, right, looks nothing like the former first lady\n\nNewsbusters said: 'Perhaps Fonda will be perfect at mangling history on film, since she's certainly done that in real life,' while The Lonely Conservative commented: 'Of all people Hollywood could haven chosen to portray Nancy Reagan in a new film, they come up with Jane Fonda. It's like they're trying to offend half of America before the movie is even made.'\n\nOn Breitbart.com they said of the 'reviled-by-Conservatives' actress: 'Arch-liberals Fonda and  Cusack playing a pair of major figures on the Right? Conservatives should stock up on antacids starting ... now.'\n\nFonda will only have a small cameo role in the movie because it spans so many years.\n\nHer views continue to enrage conservatives and the irony of her being cast in the role parallels the choice of liberal actor James Brolin as Regan in the 2003 movie The Reagans.\n\nBiopic: Eugene Allen was the White House butler through eight presidents from Harry Truman in 1952 to Reagan in 1986 when segregation laws were still in place\n\nCast: Forest Whitaker, left, is said to be playing the star of the film Eugene Allen, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey is said to be considering playing his wife\n\nThe actor has long been known to have a politically liberal reputation like his wife, Barbra Streisand.\n\nAgain in 2008, director Oliver Stone cast his son Josh Brolin as George W Bush, and in the left-wing director's earlier biopic Nixon, British actor Anthony Hopkins was cast as Richard Nixon.\n\nVariety has compared the made for TV movie to Stephen Spielberg's upcoming Lincoln.\n\nIt has been rumored that in addition to Fonda as Nancy Reagan, Liam Neeson and John Cusack are in discussions to play former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon.\n\nOprah Winfrey is considering playing Allen's wife, while Mila Kunis is in talks to play Jackie Kennedy.\n\nDaniels, who won an Oscar for Precious, is currently filming The Paperboy with Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron. The Butler is due for release next year.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

And if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women's cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore.\"\n\nKelly, 47, added Fonda, 80, has discussed her plastic surgeries \"pretty much everywhere.\" She said she had no way of knowing \"this subject was suddenly off limits.\"\n\nKelly then went after Fonda's infamous past, saying many American veterans still call Fonda \"Hanoi Jane\" because of her actions during the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I have no regrets about that question, nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. This is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage. Look at her treatment of military during the Vietnam War,\" she said. \"She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our American pilots. She called our POWs hypocrites and liars and referred to their torture as 'understandable.' Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture. But not for the rest of it. By the way she says she is not proud of America.\"\n\nWhile Kelly's comments to Fonda were met with cheers from her live audience, NBC staffers were dismayed that their management allowed Kelly to slam the actress.\n\nFrom l-r: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie interview Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin on Jan. 16, 2018.

      "text": "Veterans Call on Anti-Issa Group to Return $100k From Jane Fonda\n\nThe Vietnam War ended nearly a half century ago, but the bitter political divisions it spawned are reverberating once again this week in one of the most hotly contested congressional districts in the country.\n\nMilitary veterans who support Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) on Tuesday demanded that a Democratic group aimed at defeating him return a $100,000 donation it recently received from Jane Fonda, who turned 80 in December.\n\nAround 15 veterans outside Issa's office holding flags and sporting their combat ribbons recalled Fonda's controversial 1972 photo shoot in North Vietnam, where she was photographed sitting behind an enemy anti-aircraft gun. The stunt earned the actress the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\"\n\n\"Democrats, Democrats, you should be ashamed, taking Commie money from Hanoi Jane,\" the vets and Issa supporters shouted at a group of Democratic protestors gathered across the street.\n\nThe protesters, carrying signs with slogans such as, \"Adios Issa,\" \"Disarm Hate,\" and \"Stop Trump, Defeat Issa,\" chanted back, \"Do Your Job\" and \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Darrell Issa has got to go.\"\n\nOutnumbered roughly three to one and shouted down throughout their rally, the veterans used a megaphone to amplify their message and played patriotic songs, including Lee Greenwood's \"Proud to be an American.\"\n\nAt one point during the rally, Issa emerged from his office to cross the street and thank his veteran supporters while declining to address the Democratic protesters.\n\n\"I know that this is a lot smaller group, but we're not taking in soft money, and I'm happy for that,\" Issa said, referring to the Fonda donation and other unlimited sums donated to the Flip the 49th group and others aimed at defeating him.\n\nIssa, who served in the Army from 1970 to 1972, blasted Fonda's attempts to oust him from his seat and referred to her repeatedly as a \"traitor.\"\n\n\"Hanoi Jane is a traitor-she was a traitor during the Vietnam War and you cannot undo being a traitor,\" he told the Washington Free Beacon . \"She broadcast live from Hanoi talking about war atrocities. She would have you believe it was just one bad photograph, but I entered the army in 1970 and we consider her a traitor and that's not going to change.\"\n\n\"Anyone who thinks she's not a traitor can vote for the Democrats,\" he added.\n\nIssa's district-which is home to Camp Pendleton and more than 200,000 Marines, as well as many retired veterans-the mere mention of Fonda's name triggers strong emotions, Issa's veteran supporters said.\n\nChuck Rabel, a retired Naval officer who served as a Swift Boat skipper in Vietnam and lives in Issa's district, said he will never forgive Fonda for her trip to Vietnam.\n\n\"The proudest thing I've ever done-I took five men and me to Vietnam and we got hit 42 times, a few times big time, and I got everybody home, that's what counts. And we had no help from Hanoi Jane. Unbelievable.\"\n\nFonda has stood by her anti-war activism but has repeatedly apologized for the iconic photograph, saying she deeply regrets it and believes the North Vietnamese tricked her into sitting on the anti-aircraft gun.\n\nMany veterans say they can't forgive her, despite her labors as a workout icon and the wife of Ted Turner.\n\n\"Jane Fonda's money should go back where it came from-we don't need it here in Vista,\" said Cliff Kaiser, a 31-year veteran of the Navy submarine services who lives in the district.\n\n\"We stand for Darrell Issa and the president of the United States,\" said Patti Siegmann, a retired Marine. \"We do not stand for treason against this country. We only know Jane Fonda as Hanoi Jane who went to Vietnam and sold out America to the North Vietnamese.\"\n\nAfter narrowly eking out a win in 2016, Issa is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress this year. His attempt to hang onto the seat, which spans north San Diego and Southern Orange counties, is attracting national attention, organizers and money. Once solidly Republican territory, the district has been trending purple in recent years with a majority voting for Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.\n\nFlip the 49th Neighbors in Action, the group that took the Fonda donation, has close ties to national unions. The Service Employees Union local gave $25,000 of in-kind donations to the group, and one of its founders is David Lagstein, SEIU's political director.\n\nFor months, the group declined to disclose its donors, only doing so in mid-December when it told the San Diego Union-Tribune that Fonda had contributed $100,000 of the group's total $440,000. Other Hollywood heavyweights also donated, including: Leonardo DiCaprio, comedian Bill Maher, actor Ted Danson, and comedian Jay Leno, through his JDM Foundation.\n\nThe group did not respond to a Washington Free Beacon question about whether it would return the Fonda donation.\n\nIn a fundraising plea of his own in December, Issa cited the Fonda donation and asked his supporters to \"chip in $5\" to \"help fight back this traitor and stand with our veterans!\"\n\n\"My opponents are bought and paid for by 'Hanoi Jane; Fonda, a woman who said our POWs returning from Vietnam were 'hypocrites and liars' who shouldn't be 'hailed as heroes,'\" he said.\n\nEven though Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel and Democrat, nearly defeated Issa in the 2016 contest, national Democrats, including Rep. Adam Schiff, D., Calif., have thrown their support behind Mike Levin, an environmentalist lawyer who is running against Applegate for the chance to defeat Issa.\n\nA large contingent of the Democratic protesters who showed up at Issa's office Tuesday were sporting pro-Levin t-shirts.\n\nOne Democratic protester, Mike Lewis, sported an Applegate t-shirt at the protest Tuesday, said it's upset that national Democrats have abandoned Applegate in favor of Levin.\n\n\"I don't understand it - Schiff jumped on the wrong bandwagon right off the get go, and I thought it was shocking, and it's still shocking,\" he told the Free Beacon . \"I'm offended that some members of the local Democratic party would jump ship when Applegate is such a wonderful candidate.\"\n\nPublished under: California , Darrell Issa , Jane Fonda\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Jane Fonda Is Latest of Jon Ossoff's Celebrity Donors\n\nAntiwar activist Jane Fonda has pitched in with a last-minute contribution to Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff, according to the campaign's most recent filing.\n\nFonda, who began her antiwar activism during the Vietnam War, gave $2,000 this week to Ossoff, the leading Democratic candidate in next week's special election to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price.\n\nThe actress and physical fitness advocate is far from Ossoff's first star supporter. His candidacy has been embraced by Hollywood celebrities ranging from antigun advocate Rosie O'Donnell to topless model Chelsea Handler , who have helped Ossoff break fundraising records with a haul of over $8 million.\n\nFonda, the star of Monster-in-Law and Jane Fonda's Workout Collection , is likely Ossoff's most controversial big-money get. She was called a traitor by Vietnam veterans who labeled her \" Hanoi Jane \" after she traveled to the North Vietnam city and was photographed sitting with enemy troops on one of their antiaircraft batteries with a helmet and a gun. Vietnam veterans still protest her public events.\n\nShe has since apologized for the photograph, but stands by the decision to travel to North Vietnam as part of her antiwar campaign.\n\nFonda, who continued her antiwar activism after the Vietnam War ended, has often been a PR headache for Democratic pols. Failed Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry was labeled a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\" by opponents in 2004 after a picture of them both at an infamous antiwar rally were released.\n\nFonda, unlike 95 percent of the contributors to Ossoff so far, listed a Georgia address on her $2,000 contribution. The Jane Fonda Foundation, which has been criticized for its lack of charitable giving, is headquartered in Atlanta.\n\nOssoff is currently polling below 50 percent , which he would need to win the House seat outright; several Republican candidates are splitting more than 60 percent of the vote. Ossoff is not expected to win a run-off, assuming he fails to meet the 50 percent threshold.\n\nPublished under: Jane Fonda , Jon Ossoff\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
