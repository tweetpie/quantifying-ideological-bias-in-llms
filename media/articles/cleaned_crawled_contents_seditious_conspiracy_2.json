Tarrio, who was not in the nation's capitol on the day of the attack, nonetheless \"allegedly guided the group's activities from nearby Maryland as Proud Boys members engaged in the earliest and most aggressive attacks to confront and overwhelm police at several critical points on restricted Capitol grounds.\"\n\nFurthermore, all four men allegedly participated in \"coordinating travel to Washington and the movements of the group around the Capitol\" on January 6th,\" per the Post . \"The group is also accused of plotting to foment a riot and storm Congress, action that eventually forced the evacuation of lawmakers meeting to confirm the 2020 election results.\"\n\nSeditious conspiracy indictments have also been levied against Oath Keepers leader Steward Rhodes and 10 of his confederates for their roles in the deadly insurgency that was inspired by former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"But the new charges show that prosecutors are pulling together a wider picture of organization within extremist groups that shared overlapping if not common goals,\" the Post noted.\n\nTarrio and his co-conspirators have been detained and are pleading not guilty.\n\nMeanwhile, last Friday, Proud Boys member Josh Pruitt pleaded guilty to one count of obstructing an official proceeding on January 6th, 2021 while Congress was certifying President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.\n\nThe story continues here (subscription required)."

      "text": "'Frightening': Trump not ruling out pardoning January 6 participants convicted of sedition\n\nPrison sentences for convicted January 6 insurrectionists vary wildly from a few days to 22 years behind bars . And President-elect Donald Trump has notably been noncommittal when asked if he would include the more egregious offenders who stormed the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago.\n\nRolling Stone's Tim Dickinson reported Saturday that the president-elect has so far not said definitively whether he would include those convicted of sedition in his promised pardons for January 6 participants - which he said could happen within the first nine minutes after his inauguration. When Dickinson asked Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt whether Trump was considering pardons for people like Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who is serving 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy, she would only offer a cagey response.\n\n\"President Trump will make pardon decisions on a case-by-case basis for those who were denied due process and unfairly targeted by the justice system,\" Leavitt said.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Attorney General Merrick Garland's Department of Justice has charged approximately 1,500 people in connection with the January 6, 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol, and has secured more than 1,100 convictions as of November 2024. Over 600 of those prosecuted were sentenced to prison, including those convicted of seditious conspiracy like Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes .\n\nFederal statute defines seditious conspiracy as a felony crime in which two or more people conspire to \"overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States.\" Those convicted face up to 20 years in prison along with fines. When U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta was contemplating the concept of Rhodes being pardoned, he called it \"frightening to anyone who cares about democracy.\" Rhodes compared himself to a jailed Soviet dissident during his sentencing hearing, with Mehta countering that he was no \"political prisoner\" but an \"ongoing threat and peril to this country.\"\n\n\"No organization put more boots on the ground at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, than the Proud Boys, and they were at the forefront of every major breach of the Capitol's defenses, leading the on-the-ground efforts to storm the seat of government,\" U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew M. Graves said in a press release issued after Rhodes' sentencing. \"The leaders of the Proud Boys and the leaders of the Oath Keepers, who conspired before, during, and after the siege of the Capitol to use force against their own government to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, have now been held accountable.\"\n\nWhile Trump hasn't elaborated in detail on who will receive pardons for crimes committed on January 6, he has referred to defendants held in the Washington D.C. jail as \"hostages\" and \"political prisoners.\" An analysis by New York University's Just Security publication found that the bulk of those defendants are serving sentences for attacking police officers . This includes defendants who were found guilty by a jury at the conclusion of their trial, along with defendants who entered guilty pleas of their own volition."

      "text": "Michigan Democrats want a slate of Republicans investigated for 'seditious conspiracy': report\n\nOn Wednesday, The Detroit News reported that Democratic state lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a resolution calling on the Justice Department to investigate 11 of their GOP counterparts for \"seditious conspiracy.\"\n\n\"Sponsored by state Rep. Joe Tate, D-Detroit, the proposal is extremely unlikely to gain traction in the GOP-controlled House but underscores Democrats' beliefs that federal authorities should probe the actions that high-ranking Michigan Republicans took in the wake of Donald Trump's loss to Joe Biden,\" said the report. \"Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes or 3 percentage points, a result that's been upheld by a series of court rulings, more than 200 audits and an investigation by the Republican-run Michigan Senate's oversight committee. But some of the former president's supporters have maintained unproven claims that widespread fraud swung the race.\"\n\n\"An essential element of being a legislator is accepting the peaceful transition of power when the people choose different leaders, and these members failed to faithfully discharge the duties of their office by acting to undermine this basic tenet of democracy,\" stated the resolution. \"Michigan residents deserve better leaders than people who would subvert their own government to remain in power.\"\n\nMichigan was one of several states targeted by former President Donald Trump and his allies as part of a plot to throw out election results. Like many other states Biden narrowly won, several Republican operatives declared themselves to be \"alternate\" electors for Trump , with the idea being either the legislature could submit them instead of the lawfully certified electors won by Joe Biden, or that former Vice President Mike Pence could use them as pretext to throw out the votes of Michigan altogether. The DOJ is investigating this plot.\n\n\"Five of the Republican lawmakers - state Reps. Julie Alexander of Hanover, Beth Griffin of Mattawan, Matt Maddock of Milford, John Reilly of Oakland Township and Daire Rendon of Lake City - were entangled in a plot to advance a false slate of Republican presidential electors, claiming Trump won Michigan, according to the resolution,\" noted the report. The lawmakers themselves didn't sign the false electors certificate, contending Trump got Michigan's 16 electoral votes, but were involved in the effort, including the GOP electors' unsuccessful attempts to gain access on Dec. 14, 2020, to the Michigan Capitol.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) has also come under scrutiny after his office forwarded lists of fake electors from Michigan, as well as his home state of Wisconsin, to Pence's office."

Over the past week, four members of the Proud Boys received sentences that reflect the danger their crimes pose to our democracy.\"\n\nSimilarly, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray stated, \"Today's sentencing demonstrates that those who attempted to undermine the workings of American democracy will be held criminally accountable.\"\n\nBut after Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, 2025, he pardoned over 1500 defendants involved in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol Building and commuted the sentences of 14 other people - including Tarrio and other members of the Proud Boys. The Oath Keepers' Stewart Rhodes received a commutation from Trump as well.\n\nTarrio was released from federal prison. And USA Today's Will Carless, in an article published on February 8 , describes life after prison for Tarrio and other Proud Boys members.\n\n\"After President Donald Trump commuted their sentences last month for various serious crimes connected to the insurrection,\" Carless explains , \"Tarrio and the other top leaders of the Proud Boys find themselves contemplating the future.... And now, they are making plans.\"\n\nUSA Today interviewed Tarrio and three other Proud Boys members who were released from prison after Trump commuted their sentences: Joe Biggs (who was serving an 17-year sentence), Ethan Nordean (serving 18 years) and Zachary Rehl (sentenced to 15 years).\n\n\"Their hopes and dreams are as lofty as they are hazy,\" Carless explains . \"Tarrio speaks vaguely about entering politics. He doesn't want to abandon the Proud Boys. But he also seems to recognize the limits of the group, which alienated swathes of America by associating with white supremacists and participating in violent street brawls with leftist counter-protesters and pro-LGBTQ+ groups.\"\n\nThe USA Today reporter continues , \"Nordean talks cryptically about starting an organization that will 'reclaim\" American masculinity for young men. Rehl wants to run for Congress, but he doesn't know what seat yet. And Biggs wants to reform the American justice system - with the help of Kim Kardashian.\"\n\nCassie Miller of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project argues that Trump's efforts to mainstream the Proud Boys don't erase the group's history of violence.\n\nMiller told USA Today , \"This is a group that's foundation is violence and that believes that violence is a way of pursuing their political goals, and now Trump has signaled to them that he approves of those actions.\"\n\nSimilarly, Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told USA Today , \"The GOP has had incredible success rewriting the history of January 6, regardless of the facts. It's not surprising to hear these guys glomming on to the same narrative, that this wasn't an insurrection.\"\n\nRead the full USA Today article at this link ."

      "text": "'Are they going to come after me now?' Trump's purges revive an old question\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; President Donald Trump waves as he walks on the field before Super Bowl LIX between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs at Ceasars Superdome.\n\nThe day after President Donald Trump's inauguration, a surprise visitor joined the crowd outside the D.C. Jail, drawing double takes as people recognized his signature eyepatch: Stewart Rhodes, founder of the far-right Oath Keepers movement.\n\nBy the cold math of the justice system, Rhodes was not supposed to be there. He'd gone to sleep the night before in a Maryland prison cell, where he was serving 18 years as a convicted ringleader of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The Yale-educated firebrand who once boasted a nationwide paramilitary network had seen his organization collapse under prosecution.\n\nFor the Justice Department, Rhodes' seditious conspiracy conviction was bigger than crushing the Oath Keepers - it was a hard-won victory in the government's efforts to reorient a creaky bureaucracy toward a rapidly evolving homegrown threat. On his first day in office, Trump erased that work by granting clemency to more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants, declaring an end to \"a grave national injustice.\"\n\nRhodes, sporting a Trump 2020 cap, was back in Washington with fellow \"J6ers\" within hours of his release in the early hours of Jan. 21, 2025 . In the frigid air outside \"the gulag,\" as the D.C. Jail is known in this crowd, he was swarmed by TV cameras and supporters offering congratulations. Nearby, far-right Proud Boys members puffed cigars. A speaker blared Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song.\"\n\n\"It's surreal,\" Rhodes said, absorbing the scene.\n\nThe shock of the moment has continued to reverberate far beyond the jailhouse parking lot.\n\nTrump's pardons immediately upended the biggest single prosecution in U.S. history and signaled a broader reversal that threatens to create a more permissive climate in which extremists could regroup, weaken the FBI's independence and revive old debates about who counts as a terrorist, according to current and former federal law enforcement officials and national security experts.\n\nIn the whirlwind of the last three weeks, the Trump administration has purged federal law enforcement agencies of prosecutors and investigators who'd been pursuing homegrown far-right groups that the FBI lists as among the most dangerous threats to national security. The Biden administration's 2021 domestic terrorism strategy - the nation's first - was removed from the White House website. And some government-funded extremism-prevention programs were ordered to stop work.\n\n\"There's no indication that he engaged in any kind of assessment or has even stopped to think, 'What did I just unleash on America?'\" Mary McCord, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw domestic terrorism cases as a senior Justice Department official, said of Trump's actions.\n\nColin Clarke, an analyst at the nonpartisan security-focused Soufan Center, said \"far right\" and \"domestic terrorism\" are now \"kind of dirty words with the current administration.\"\n\nFar-right movements that openly promote violence have suddenly been invigorated, he said. \"Does this become a four-year period where these groups can really use the time to strengthen their organization, their command and control, stockpile weapons?\" he said.\n\nThe changes are a departure even from the first Trump White House, which ramped up attention on domestic terrorism in 2019 after attacks including the deadly white supremacist rampage that August targeting Latino shoppers in El Paso, Texas.\n\nThe next month, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report that described domestic terrorism as a \"growing threat,\" that had \"too frequently struck our houses of worship, our schools, our workplaces, our festivals, and our shopping spaces.\"\n\nJoe Biden made violent extremism a central theme of his 2020 presidential campaign, saying that he'd been inspired to run for office by a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned violent, leaving one person dead. His administration's steps borrowed from previous campaigns to combat AIDS and framed radicalization as a public health priority. Biden also made efforts to address extremism in the ranks of the military and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nExperts described the effort as modest, but the moves were welcomed among counterterrorism specialists as an overdue corrective to a disproportionate focus on Islamist militant groups whose threat to the United States has receded in the decades since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by al-Qaida.\n\nA failure of authorities to pivot to the homegrown threat was cited in the findings of a Senate panel that examined intelligence missteps ahead of the Capitol attack. The report called for a reevaluation of the government's analysis of domestic threats, finding that, \"Neither the FBI nor DHS deemed online posts calling for violence at the Capitol as credible.\"\n\nThis Trump administration has shown no appetite for such measures. Instead, the White House pardons are nudging fringe movements deeper into the mainstream and closer to power, said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, who leads an extremism research lab at American University and has testified before Congress about the threat.\n\n\"It creates immediate national security risks from people who are pledging revenge and retribution and who have now been valorized,\" Miller-Idriss said.\n\nWithin 24 hours of his release, Rhodes had embarked on a comeback blitz. He visited the Capitol and stopped by a Dunkin' Donuts in the House office building. Three days later, he was in a crowd standing behind Trump at a rally in Las Vegas.\n\nRhodes was among 14 defendants whose charges were commuted rather than being pardoned. Though he didn't enter the Capitol on Jan. 6, he was convicted of orchestrating the Oath Keepers' violent actions that day. At trial, prosecutors played a recording of him saying, \"My only regret is they should have brought rifles.\"\n\nAt the Capitol after his release, he told reporters he plans to seek a full pardon.\n\nEmboldened by the pardons and Trump's laser focus on mass deportations, which is redirecting authorities' attention, far-right extremists rejoiced at the idea of having more space to organize.\n\nChat forums filled with would-be MAGA vigilantes who fantasize about rounding up Democratic politicians or acting as bounty hunters to corral undocumented migrants. Researchers noted one Proud Boys chat group where users had posted the LinkedIn pages of corrections officers who purportedly oversaw Jan. 6 detainees.\n\nNewly freed prisoners, no longer subject to orders to stay away from extremists and co-defendants, gathered for a virtual reunion, hosted on Elon Musk's X platform the weekend after their release. For hours, they talked about what led them to the Capitol, how they were taken into custody and the harsh jail conditions they faced - a vivid, albeit one-sided, oral history of life at the center of what the Justice Department had hailed as a landmark domestic terrorism investigation.\n\nThe reunion on X offered a glimpse of men juggling the thrill of their vindication with the mundane logistics of reintegrating to society. One former defendant called in from a Florida shopping mall where he was buying sneakers with his mom. A Montana man who embraces the QAnon conspiracy theory said he was experiencing the most exciting time of his life.\n\nSome were too flustered to articulate their thoughts beyond a deep gratitude for God and Trump. Others sounded fired up, ready to run for office, join a class-action lawsuit over their prosecution or find others ways to, as one pardoned rioter put it, \"fight the hell out of this thing.\"\n\nOutside the D.C. Jail, pardoned defendants described the whiplash of their sudden status change from alleged and convicted criminals to freed patriots.\n\nWilliam Sarsfield III, a tall, gray-bearded man in a camouflage cap printed with \"Biden Sucks,\" sipped coffee outside the jail. Before dawn that morning, he'd been released from a Philadelphia detention center where he was awaiting sentencing on felony and misdemeanor convictions .\n\nCourt papers, backed by video evidence, describe Sarsfield as joining other Capitol rioters in trying to push through a police line with such force that \"one officer could be heard screaming in agonizing pain as he was smashed between a shield and a metal door frame.\" Sarsfield insists the charges were inflated, noting that he also helped officers escape the mob that day.\n\nIn the runup to Trump's inauguration, rumors had swirled about an imminent pardon, though details were fuzzy. Sarsfield said his girlfriend was so certain Trump would deliver that she hopped in a truck and raced from Gun Barrel City, an hour southeast of Dallas, to the jail in Philadelphia, a 22-hour drive.\n\n\"She drove all the way from Texas on faith,\" he said. \"Because we both knew it was going to be right. A man's word is what his word is.\"\n\nAfter his release, Sarsfield said, he headed straight to the D.C. \"gulag\" to make sure others were getting out, too. He still wore his jail uniform of sweats and orange slippers. The miracle of his freedom was just beginning to sink in.\n\n\"I got pardoned by a felon,\" Sarsfield said with an incredulous chuckle, referring to Trump's distinction as the only U.S. president to serve after a felony conviction.\n\nSarsfield said he planned to show his appreciation by helping Trump \"clean up in local communities,\" which he said meant working at the grassroots level to expose prosecutors and politicians he believes have corrupted the justice system.\n\n\"When people decide not to use the rule of law, that becomes tyrannical,\" Sarsfield said. \"And in our Constitution I'm pretty sure it says when tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.\"\n\nThe uncertainty of what comes next is nerve-wracking for longtime monitors of violent extremists. Even in their worst-case scenarios, they said, few foresaw the Trump administration sending hundreds of diehard election deniers back into their communities as aggrieved heroes.\n\n\"A lot of these people will have martyrdom or legendary status among extremist circles, and that is a very powerful recruiting tool,\" said Kieran Doyle, North America research manager for the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global conflict monitoring group.\n\nACLED research shows extremist activity such as demonstrations and acts of political violence has declined since 2023, which saw a 35% reduction in mobilization compared to the previous year. Doyle and other monitors credit the drop in part to the chilling effect of the Justice Department's post-Jan. 6 crackdown on anti-government and white supremacist movements.\n\nDoyle cautioned that it's too early to assess the ripple effect of Trump's clemency on extremist activity. Their ability to regroup depends on several factors, including fear of FBI infiltration, which could subside now that hard-right Trump loyalists are overseeing the Justice Department.\n\n\"We're at an inflection point,\" Doyle said.\n\nAt the FBI, the Trump administration's post-clemency vows of payback have sidelined a cohort of senior officials who oversaw the Jan. 6 portfolio of cases, resulting in the loss of some of the bureau's most seasoned counterterrorism professionals.\n\nWithout that expertise, investigators run the risk of violating a suspect's civil rights or, conversely, overlooking threats because they are assumed to be constitutionally protected, said a veteran FBI analyst who has worked on Jan. 6 cases.\n\n\"It has the potential to cut both ways,\" the analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nMany longtime monitors of extremist movements have themselves become targets of threats and violence from Jan. 6 defendants and their supporters, raising anxiety about their release from prison.\n\nMegan Squire, a computer scientist who in 2017 was among the first academic researchers documenting the Proud Boys' increasingly organized violence, said members are already \"saber-rattling and reconstituting dead chapters.\"\n\nThe group's former leader, Enrique Tarrio, released from prison in Louisiana, told the far-right Infowars podcast : \"Success is going to be retribution.\"\n\nAll five Proud Boys charged with seditious conspiracy in connection with the Capitol attack were in Squire's original dataset. Another member who was a Jan. 6 defendant had previously blasted Squire on social media and posted her private information on Telegram.\n\nSquire, who has since joined the civil rights-focused Southern Poverty Law Center, said she finds herself wondering, \"Are they going to come after me now?\""

      "text": "How years of violent racism followed the last two times the US pardoned insurrectionists\n\nStewart Rhodes, former leader of the Oath Keepers, and Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, former national chairman of the Proud Boys, both of whom were pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump for their roles in the January 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, speak during a press availability outside the Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 21, 2025.\n\nDonald Trump is the third U.S. president to pardon a large group of insurrectionists. His clemency toward those convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection - including seditious conspiracy and assaults on police officers - was different in key ways from the two previous efforts, by Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Ulysses S. Grant in 1873.\n\nBut they share the apparent hope that their pardons would herald periods of national harmony. As historians of the period after the Civil War, we know that for Johnson and Grant, that's not what happened.\n\nWhen Johnson became president in 1865 after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, he faced a combative Congress. Though Johnson had opposed the secession of the Southern states before the Civil War began, he agreed with former Confederate leaders that formerly enslaved people did not deserve equality with white people.\n\nFurther, as a Southerner, he wanted to maintain the social conventions and economic structure of the South by replacing enslavement with economic bondage . This economic bondage, called sharecropping, was a system by which tenant farmers rented land from large landowners. Tenants rarely cleared enough to pay their costs and fell into debt. In effect, Johnson sought to restore the nation to how it was before the Civil War, though without legalized slavery - and sought every avenue available to thwart the plans of the Radical Republicans who controlled both houses of Congress to create full racial equality.\n\nJohnson signed an amnesty that gave a blanket pardon to all former Confederate soldiers. However, he required formerly high-ranking Confederate officials to individually seek pardons for their involvement in the rebellion. These officials faced permanent disfranchisement and could not hold federal office if they did not seek a pardon.\n\nWhen Congress was in recess, Johnson vetoed two bills that had been passed: one to help find homes for formerly enslaved people who could no longer live on the property of their enslavers, and the other to define U.S. citizenship and ensure equal protection of the laws for Black people as well as white people.\n\nJohnson also told Southern states not to ratify the 14th Amendment , whose purpose was to enshrine both citizenship and equal protection in the Constitution.\n\nWhen Congress came back in session, it continued its effort of Reconstruction of the former Confederate states - reforming their racist laws and policies to comport with the liberty and equality the Union was committed to - by overriding Johnson's vetoes and requiring former Confederate states to ratify the 14th Amendment as a condition of readmission to the Union. But Congress could not override the pardons the president had granted.\n\nThis continued political warfare resulted in Johnson being impeached - but not convicted or removed from office. But the back-and-forth also stalled Reconstruction and efforts toward racial equality, ultimately dooming the effort .\n\nNathan Bedford Forrest was not covered by Johnson's general amnesty. As a former Confederate general, he had to apply for a personal presidential pardon , which Johnson granted on July 17, 1868. Two months later, Forrest represented Tennessee at the Democratic Party's national convention in New York City.\n\nHe also took command of the Ku Klux Klan , the unofficial militant wing of the Democratic Party . Forrest initiated the title \"Grand Wizard,\" a bizarre title derived from his Civil War nickname, \" Wizard of the Saddle .\" He became a leader of former Confederates who resisted Reconstruction through violence and terror .\n\nAfter his pardon, Forrest perfected a rhetorical technique for his extremism. His biographer Court Carney described it as a multistep process, starting with, \"Say something exaggerated and inflammatory that plays well with supporters.\" Then, deny saying it \"to maintain a semblance of professional decorum.\" Then, blur the threats with \"crowd pleasing humor.\" It proved an effective way of threatening violence while being able to deny responsibility for any violence that occurred.\n\nUnder Forrest's leadership, membership in the violent, racist Ku Klux Klan spread almost everywhere in the South. Records are sketchy, so it's impossible to say how many people were lynched, but the Equal Justice Initiative has documented 2,000 lynchings of Black Americans during Reconstruction. Black women and girls were often raped by klansmen or members of its successor militias.\n\nIt's also not possible to say how many pardoned ex-Confederates participated in the lynchings. But the violence was so widespread that just about everyone, North and South, thought the political violence was a resumption of the Civil War .\n\nIn the Piedmont of the Carolinas, klan violence amounted to a shadow government of white nationalists . Grant ordered the U.S. Army to apprehend the klansmen , and a newly minted Department of Justice prosecuted the insurrectionists for violating civil rights guaranteed by the 14th and 15th amendments. After several trials that proved to be what the federal judiciary's official history calls \" dramatic spectacles ,\" federal judges handed down conviction after conviction.\n\nThe federal government's decisive action allowed for a relatively free presidential election in 1872. Black voters helped Grant win in eight Southern states , contributing to his landslide victory.\n\nBut after his reelection, Grant appointed a new attorney general, who dropped the pending klan cases. Grant also pardoned klansmen who had already been convicted of crimes.\n\nGrant hoped his gesture would encourage Southerners to accept the nation's new birth of freedom.\n\nIt didn't. The pardons told former Confederates that they were winning .\n\nJohn Christopher Winsmith, an ex-Confederate who embraced racial equality and whose father had been killed by the KKK , wrote to Grant in 1873, \"A few trials and convictions in the U.S. Courts, and then the pardoning of the criminals\" had emboldened what he called \" the hideous monster - Ku Kluxism .\"\n\nAnd a new gang arose, too: the Red Shirts , who began to murder Black people openly, not even in secret as the klan did. Two of the Red Shirts were later elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nParamilitary groups established anti-democratic one-party rule in every former Confederate state, imposing discriminatory laws known as Jim Crow , which were enforced by lynchings and other forms of racial violence.\n\nThe federal government took no substantive action against this for a century, until the 20th century's Civil Rights Movement sparked change. And it wasn't until 2022 that Congress passed an anti-lynching bill .\n\nJoseph Patrick Kelly , Professor of Literature and Director of Irish and Irish American Studies, College of Charleston and David Cason , Associate Professor in Honors, University of North Dakota\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "The trouble with fighting domestic terrorism\n\nSome of the most prominent members of the Proud Boys, a far-right militant group that functions more like a street gang than a militia, have been sentenced to long terms in federal prison for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\nExperts declare that these successful prosecutions by the U.S. Justice Department will not only discourage far-right groups but also deter people from joining them and engaging in future criminal activity.\n\nGroup chairman Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison after being found guilty of seditious conspiracy . Group leaders Ethan Nordean, Joe Biggs and Zachary Rehl were also found guilty of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 18, 17 and 15 years, respectively. Dominic Pezzola , a Proud Boys member who breached the Capitol building with a stolen police riot shield, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but was convicted of a variety of felonies, including assaulting a police officer, robbing government property and obstructing an official proceeding - and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nBut despite the lengths of those sentences, prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly to impose even harsher ones, claiming the offenses were related to terrorism. Kelly, however, ruled that claims of terrorism overstate the conduct of the Proud Boys sentenced.\n\nThat fits with our analysis of the Proud Boys. As scholars who study street gangs and far-right groups, we see that the larger law enforcement community continues to focus - we believe mistakenly - on the belief that, like terrorist groups, white supremacists are coordinated in ideology and intent. Evidence shows that perception actually diverts local police agencies' attention from identifying and managing these groups .\n\nGangs are generally defined as durable, street-oriented groups whose own identity includes involvement in illegal activity . We believe that if police had treated Proud Boys as members of a street gang from the group's inception in 2016, the events of Jan. 6, 2021, might have been avoided, or at least reduced in severity.\n\nThe United States lacks explicit laws banning domestic terrorism, in part because they are constitutionally controversial and may target unintended groups.\n\nThat problem has arisen with other criminal laws, such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , which was designed to specifically target organized crime groups, like the Italian Mafia. The application of RICO, however, has been adapted and used aggressively against Black, Latino and Indigenous groups and political protestors .\n\nNevertheless, some have suggested that passing laws defining and outlawing domestic terrorism would be the best way to deal with the threats posed by the Proud Boys and other far-right extremists.\n\nBut when Canada and New Zealand designated the Proud Boys as a terrorist organization, that did not eliminate white supremacists from those countries. It merely forced them to rebrand themselves with a new name and logo. Treating Proud Boys solely as members of a terrorist organization does not actually stamp out white supremacy groups.\n\nInstead, this perception hurts local law enforcement's ability to recognize local, disorganized, far-right groups as street gangs and not terrorist groups. Police discretion is immense. Time and again, police have been documented ignoring Proud Boys violence and intimidation . Failing to arrest members explicitly observed in criminal infractions has only encouraged future acts of violence. Furthermore, local law enforcement's history of failing to investigate and arrest members of far-right groups forces the federal government to be solely responsible for prosecuting them.\n\nProud Boys member Dominic Pezzola, center with police shield, was among those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta\n\nFrom the very start, Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes explicitly declared the group a \" gang .\" Local police across the U.S. actively investigate and prosecute gangs, especially those whose members are Black , Latino and other people of color .\n\nProud Boys are predominantly white men who also intimidate and threaten communities around the U.S. with disorderly conduct, public harassment and more serious violence, including battery, assault, murder, rioting and hate crimes . This \"cafeteria-style\" offending is quite common among gang members participating in a range of criminal activities.\n\nBut, perhaps because of the Proud Boys' claims to be just a \" western chauvinist \" men's club, local law enforcement agencies have tended not to treat the Proud Boys and other far-right groups as street gangs. Such increased scrutiny by police of their criminal activities would have produced a much greater deterrent effect. Instead, the lack of acknowledging the Proud Boys' violent criminal behavior only emboldened them further.\n\nIn fact, police have either remained idle or even consorted with Proud Boys members at recent protests, even giving them high-fives , as observed in Columbus, Ohio, at a demonstration against the \"Holi-drag\" story time event. This type of police engagement is just one element of how police ignore the threat of white supremacy and its followers.\n\nMany Proud Boys fail to exhibit remorse for their actions. Pezzola declared \"Trump won!\" as he exited the federal courtroom after his sentencing. Tarrio is now positioning himself as a political prisoner to rally support from the GOP.\n\nThis raises our concerns that Proud Boys members will continue to be active and violent. Research finds it is effective for police to systematically monitor and target groups that exhibit violent behavior and that doing so deters future acts of violence.\n\nSometimes, new laws can help. In Alabama, for instance, a law enacted in June expands the legal definition of groups police might be concerned about. Instead of using a specific term like \"street gang,\" as most states do, the Alabama law defines a \" criminal enterprise \" as any group of three or more people who engage in a pattern of criminal activity. Such an approach aids in removing the bias in law enforcement that street gangs are composed only of urban youth.\n\nWe hope that police will collect and share information about far-right groups' criminal acts with other agencies to help identify people who are active in various areas of a state or even around the country. But in the end, the evidence shows that the Proud Boys, like any street gang, remain primarily localized groups that are best dealt with by local police, not federal agents.\n\nMatthew Valasik , Associate Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of Alabama and Shannon Reid , Associate Professor of Criminal Justice and Criminology, University of North Carolina - Charlotte\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "It Was Sedition\n\nThe Oath Keepers imagine themselves to be true patriots, but, as a jury of their peers found this week, their deeds were a crime against the United States.\n\nIt's fitting that Merriam-Webster's word of the year is gaslighting . Since a violent mob assaulted the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 , apologists have tried to argue that the thing everyone saw with their own eyes, captured in videos and photographs, simply wasn't what it appeared to be.\n\nIf it was so violent, they say, why wasn't anyone armed? But, of course, the images show rioters using flagpoles, baseball bats, and other things as weapons. Okay, but they weren't carrying firearms. Except that now men who did bring guns have been convicted, and the House committee investigating the riot has produced evidence that many people were carrying firearms. Even more enduring a rebuttal has been this: If this was really an attempt to keep Donald Trump as president and prevent the inauguration of Joe Biden, why has no one been convicted of sedition ?\n\nNow that has fallen by the wayside, too. A jury in Washington, D.C., yesterday convicted Stewart Rhodes and Kelly Meggs, two leaders of the militia called the Oath Keepers , of seditious conspiracy.\n\nRead: Inside the Oath Keepers\n\nJurors returned a complex set of verdicts. They also found Rhodes, Meggs, and other leaders of the group guilty of obstructing the certification of the election and destroying evidence, but acquitted Rhodes of two other conspiracy charges and three others of seditious conspiracy charges. Rhodes's lawyer said he would appeal the decision.\n\nSedition (or seditious conspiracy, as federal law defines the crime) is likely unfamiliar to many people, and for good reason: It's extremely rare. The charge involves \"conspir[ing] to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States ... or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States.\"\n\nSedition is related to but separate from treason, which involves aiding the nation's enemies. The term was used far too loosely during the Trump years -most prominently by the president, though also sometimes by his critics-but it has an actual legal meaning and is seldom charged, because it's very hard to prove. Similarly, what happened on January 6 was an insurrection in the plain English sense, but the formal charge of insurrection is seldom brought . (Ironically, Rhodes has been a promiscuous source of flimsy accusations of insurrection.) Earlier this year, the law professor Carlton Larson explained why seditious conspiracy is a sensible charge in this case.\n\nCarlton Larson: Seditious conspiracy was the right charge for the January 6 organizers\n\nTellingly, the federal law against seditious conspiracy dates to the Civil War; on January 6 of last year, rioters carried the Confederate battle flag in the halls of the Capitol, a desecration that never happened during the war. But actual cases are few and far between, in part because instances of seditious behavior that actually amount to anything-much less a ransacking of the Capitol-are rare. The last time the government successfully prosecuted someone under the charge was in a mid-1990s case against the radical Muslim cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman and some followers for a plot to bomb New York City landmarks. In 2010, the Justice Department charged members of a bizarre far-right militia called the Hutaree with seditious conspiracy, but they were acquitted two years later.\n\nRead: He dares call it treason\n\nThese rare successes made some observers wonder whether DOJ had erred in bringing the charge against the Oath Keepers, either because it might be too hard to prove or because it might open the door up to dubious future prosecutions. But the convictions offer some vindication for the decision. Not only did the prosecutors succeed in convicting Rhodes and company, but by convicting him of this particular charge, they put the lie to the idea that what happened on January 6 was simply a few overzealous people who got a little excited but posed no threat to the peaceful transfer of power. It also shows why the riot at the Capitol was not equivalent to violence that broke out in cities in summer 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, which was lawless but not part of any conspiracy against the federal government.\n\nThe verdict should also puncture the central claim of the Oath Keepers, an organization that gradually transformed from a sort of quietist movement into a more radical and violent force over the course of Trump's presidency. Rhodes, a Yale-educated lawyer, and the group claim to be the true patriots. The name refers to the oath that service members take to \"support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\" As a jury of their peers concluded this week, it turns out they were the real domestic enemies of the Constitution."

      "text": "Seditious Conspiracy Was the Right Charge for the January 6 Organizers\n\nThe possibility that prosecutors might abuse the charge in the future is hardly a reason to shrink from it now, when it is most applicable.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal grand jury indicted 11 members of the so-called Oath Keepers for seditious conspiracy . Such charges are exceptionally rare-and, quite obviously, extremely serious. If convicted, these defendants could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAnd yet many Americans think that the charges should have been even more serious: treason against the United States. Although that's not an implausible argument, the Justice Department made the right decision. Treason prosecutions would have introduced significant legal complexity, while doing very little to increase sentences. Seditious-conspiracy charges, by contrast, are perfectly pitched to the gravity of the offenses, and given the substantial evidence laid out in the indictments, should be relatively straightforward to prove.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is defined as \"conspir[ing] to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States ... or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States.\" In the past 30 years, there have been only four sets of indictments for this offense. Most notably, the Justice Department successfully convicted Omar Abdel-Rahman of seditious conspiracy for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. But the most recent seditious-conspiracy prosecution-of Michigan militia members in the early 2010s-was a fiasco . A judge dismissed the seditious-conspiracy charges, finding them unsupported by the evidence.\n\nRead: Trump's next coup has already begun\n\nSome have raised concerns about the scope of the seditious-conspiracy statute. For example, the University of Wisconsin law professor Joshua Braver has warned that seditious-conspiracy prosecutions could be subject to significant abuse. After all, the literal language of the statute might cover actions such as the Women's March, which interfered with Capitol operations during Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings. Braver prefers the charge of \" rebellion or insurrection ,\" which he believes is a better fit for the events of January 6 .\n\nI disagree. Seditious conspiracy is an entirely appropriate charge for some of the January 6 participants, as I suggested at the time. The attack was aimed at the most essential ritual of democracy-the peaceful transfer of power. The possibility that prosecutors might abuse the charge in the future is hardly a reason to shrink from it now, when it is most applicable.\n\nTo be clear, seditious conspiracy is relevant for only a small subset of the people who entered the Capitol on January 6. The offense requires a conspiracy-a prior agreement to commit particular offenses; it does not encompass people who simply made impulsive decisions in the heat of the moment. According to the allegations in the indictment, the Oath Keepers plotted their moves for weeks in advance, coordinated weapons stashes outside of Washington, D.C., donned combat and tactical gear, and were in constant communication throughout the attack, all for the purpose of disrupting the certification of the 2020 election results. If this is not a seditious conspiracy, it is hard to know what is.\n\nThese alleged facts also warrant at least a consideration of treason charges. Under the Constitution , treason is limited to two offenses: levying war against the United States and \"adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\" Adhering to the enemy is the more familiar type of treason. All of the 20th-century treason cases, such as the prosecution of Iva Toguri, the so-called Tokyo Rose, involved aid to a foreign enemy. By contrast, no person has been charged with levying war against the United States since the 19th century when, for example, the charge was brought against Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, at the end of the Civil War.\n\nIt was also the charge brought in the very first federal treason cases-prosecutions of tax protesters in Pennsylvania following the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 and Fries's Rebellion of 1799. The Whiskey rebels attacked the home of a federal tax official and assembled a large group of armed men in opposition to the federal excise tax on whiskey. The Fries's rebels released prisoners from federal custody out of opposition to a federal property tax. In both cases, Supreme Court justices held that the alleged conduct amounted to treason. The use of force to obstruct a particular federal law, they argued, constituted levying war against the United States.\n\nStorming the Capitol to obstruct the Electoral Count Act and sending members of Congress fleeing in terror is far more egregious-and more of a direct affront to the government-than anything done by the Whiskey rebels or the Fries's rebels. But the understanding of \"levying war\" may have changed. In a famous 1851 decision involving armed opposition to enforcement of the federal Fugitive Slave Act, Justice Robert Grier suggested that levying war against the United States requires an intent to overthrow the government entirely, not just to obstruct the operation of one particular law. It was a trial-level decision, but it may prove convincing to courts today. If so, the question would then become whether the defendants sought to overthrow the government in its entirety.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The New Lost Cause\n\nApplied to January 6, this sounds like a law-school-exam hypothetical from hell. After all, the defendants would insist that, far from trying to overthrow the government, they were in fact supporting the incumbent president of the United States. If they honestly, but foolishly, believed that the election was stolen, did they have the requisite criminal intent to commit treason? Who exactly is overthrowing the \"government\" if one branch decides to wage war on another? Can one overthrow the government by attacking only the legislative branch? These questions are profoundly interesting from a philosophical perspective, but I fully understand why Justice Department attorneys would recoil in horror from having to debate them in court.\n\nA further obstacle to a treason charge is far more mundane. The Constitution requires that treason convictions be supported either by two witnesses to the same overt act or a confession in open court. Although no court has ever addressed the question, videotape evidence is likely not a sufficient substitute for two witnesses; in cases arising out of World War II, for example, the Justice Department decided that radio-broadcast recordings of defendants distributing enemy propaganda were not legally sufficient for conviction. Unless the Oath Keepers begin turning on one another, finding two witnesses to distinct, overt acts may be difficult.\n\nGiven all the legal complexities the Justice Department has to consider, seditious conspiracy was clearly the right choice. In a recent speech, Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged that \"the Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law-whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.\" The most recent indictments are a promising step in that direction."

      "text": "The Prospect of Prison Time Spoils Far-Right Fantasies\n\nMaking extremist leaders answer for their actions will deter future violence.\n\nStewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers, faces a prison sentence for doing something on January 6, 2021, that he didn't specifically plan on doing. Along with a co-defendant, Kelly Meggs, Rhodes was found guilty this week of seditious conspiracy for the Oath Keepers' efforts to stop the peaceful transfer of power and keep President Donald Trump in the White House. Rhodes, who founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 and gained national prominence during the Trump presidency, was also acquitted of planning in advance to disrupt the certification of the election that day. These seemingly contradictory verdicts show something important: Insurrectionist leaders don't need to plot out acts of violence in minute detail to be held legally responsible for them, and the rioters who busted into the Capitol must not be the only people to incur criminal penalties.\n\nThis outcome is a victory for democratic norms. It upholds the idea that leaders of extremist groups should be held accountable for rousing their armed followers to violence-even when those leaders try to preserve a shred of plausible deniability.\n\nDavid A. Graham: It was sedition\n\nRhodes was present on the Capitol grounds, but he did not physically enter the building. His defense team contended that although the Oath Keepers leader wanted to keep Joe Biden from being declared the next president, the violence was largely spontaneous. Rhodes took the stand and testified that he hadn't ordered the attack. In an apparent effort to beat the conspiracy charge, a defense lawyer contended in his closing argument that \"venting is not a meeting of the minds\" and downplayed the Oath Keepers' activities as \"horribly heated rhetoric and bombast.\"\n\nThe jury understood that Rhodes had every intention of disrupting the election certification even if the specifics were left somewhat to chance. He cannot claim innocence. When violence breaks out after your followers don military gear and carry weapons to the Capitol with the specific goal of keeping Trump in office, you can't avoid responsibility by pretending you didn't mean what you said.\n\nRhodes's fevered talk of keeping Trump in office via a \"bloody civil war\" means he wasn't an innocent bystander, even if he let his frenzied followers-many of whom now face criminal charges for rioting inside the Capitol-do the heavy lifting.\n\nIf leaders have to answer for the violence they inspire, they will have a harder time gaining traction in the future. Since the beginning of the Trump era, far-right groups have recruited new members with fantasies of armed conflict; adherents are convinced that they can be on the winning side of history. Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, floundered for years until the Oath Keepers found kinship with the Trump movement and with Trump himself, who flirted with extremist groups before fully embracing them after his election loss. This week's verdict further dispels the idea that the Oath Keepers are winners in any way. Every criminal conviction of figures implicated in the January 6 attack at any level-even on the misdemeanor charges facing some rank-and file rioters-helps discourage would-be recruits from seeing militia groups as a path to glory.\n\nAlthough the jury likely did not debate the intricacies of how violence works, Rhodes's conviction is a condemnation of stochastic terrorism -a technique the Oath Keepers share with the Islamic State. Leaders of such groups incite their followers in ways that make bloodshed all but inevitable, even if the specifics of how the violence will play out are unknowable beforehand.\n\nFrom the November 2020 issue: A pro-Trump militant group has recruited thousands of police, soldiers, and veterans\n\nIn recent weeks, right-wing commentators have criticized the very notion of stochastic terrorism, treating it as just another broad accusation that Trump's political opponents level against the former president and his supporters. Yet Rhodes's trial points to a highly specific way in which some groups incite and normalize violence. They have used tools of intimidation, such as wearing military costumes and brandishing weapons, to achieve political goals-while also acting like what they're doing is no big deal. Casual threats of civil war, when coupled with the means to wage it, are no longer casual. The standard for criminal conviction for promoting violence is justifiably high, but some leaders of some groups act egregiously enough to reach it.\n\nRhodes's jury made a statement for the future. Although a single criminal case will not deter all hate and violence, a series of similar verdicts could significantly hamper violent groups' ability to organize. Fomenting a bloody riot isn't a game, and it isn't mere protest. Criminal prosecution will find you."

      "text": "The January 6er Who Left Trumpism\n\nNot every Capitol rioter was a card-carrying seditionist; some have regrets, and a few are even refusing a pardon. Jason Riddle is one.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\n\"I was okay with being a convict,\" Jason Riddle told me this week, not long after learning that he was among the roughly 1,500 recipients of sweeping presidential pardons. Some Americans, including President Donald Trump, believe that Riddle and others who rioted at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, were unjustly persecuted and thus deserving of clemency-if not celebration. Riddle, a 36-year-old New Hampshire resident, rejects this framing. \"I'm not a patriot or a hero just because the guy who started the riot says it's okay,\" he told me.\n\nOn Thursday, after consulting with his public defender, Riddle sent a pithy email to the Department of Justice:\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI'd like to reject my pardon please.\n\nSincerely, Jason Riddle\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nDeclining the pardon falls within Riddle's legal rights. Many other January 6ers are holding out their hands for the president's gift. \"I can't look myself in the mirror and do that,\" Riddle said. Rather than whitewash his unsavory past, he feels called to own his behavior, even his most shameful moments-a tenet of Alcoholics Anonymous, which he says has saved him.\n\nSome insurrectionists stormed the Capitol as true ideological warriors. Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, for example, were convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States (and both men are now free). But many others who participated in the violence and destruction that day were similar to Riddle-people with ordinary lives and ordinary problems who found community and catharsis in the MAGA movement.\n\nNone of the above is an excuse for taking part in one of the ugliest moments in American history. But actively planning to carry out violence is arguably different from getting swept up in a mob. Today, Riddle doesn't shirk his complicity. But the path that led him to the Capitol sheds light on how someone without much direction suddenly found it in a day of rage and mayhem. His story also raises an intriguing possibility: A person who stumbled into the darker corners of Trumpism can also stumble out.\n\nF or Riddle , the road to January 6 began after he graduated from high school, years before Trump's first campaign. He served in the Navy and, according to his sentencing memo, \"was honorably released from active duty to the naval reserves in light of reocurring [ sic ] struggles with alcohol use.\" In college, at Southern Connecticut State University, as an older student, he decided to major in political science. On campus, he recalls feeling surrounded by younger Bernie Sanders supporters, while he took a liking to Trump. He described himself and another early Trump-supporting buddy as \"obnoxious,\" noting that they'd frequently drink in class. During Trump's first presidential campaign, Riddle drove to rallies all over the country. At first he told himself that, as a poli-sci major, he was making anthropological field trips. In truth, he was becoming swept up in MAGA world.\n\nHe liked the excitement and controversy that surrounded Trump. \"There was this aggression . I think I really enjoyed it,\" he said. He'd pregame before the rallies, then join the crowds listening to the future president rant. \"You go, you know, bond with these strangers,\" he said. At that time in his life, Riddle remembers having barely any other interests or hobbies. He didn't watch sports or exercise. He'd sit at home, drinking and trolling. \"I spent all my time in those comments [sections] on social media, arguing with strangers,\" Riddle said. \"It was all about proving someone wrong. That would make me feel good about myself.\"\n\nAfter college, he struggled to hold down a job. Eventually, he found work as a mail carrier for the Postal Service. On his route, he'd ruminate. He'd carry on long conversations with a drinking buddy. \"I would just be on the phone with my Bluetooth in, talking to another maniac who thinks like me, while just slowly going crazy,\" Riddle said.\n\nRadicalization can be a gradual process. He described himself as more of a libertarian than a MAGA Republican. In Trumpism, though, Riddle found an always-there outlet for his pent-up dissatisfaction with how his life was unfolding. But Trump's time in office was running out. As he plotted to cling to power by desperate means, the president and his allies were spreading conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud, including lies about mail-in ballots. \"So I'm, like, literally working at the mail, which is what I believed to be part of the problem with the election,\" Riddle said. In the weeks before the insurrection, he told me, he was drinking more heavily than ever. Sometimes, he'd stash additional booze in the mailbag he carried for the day's rounds.\n\nOne day, drunk on the job, he abruptly quit, leaving piles of mail in his truck. Soon, he and two friends were driving from New Hampshire to Washington, D.C. One was a Trump supporter; the other, Riddle now thinks, was just along for the ride. Riddle's own commitment to the \"Stop the Steal\" narrative involved some doublethink. \"I know I'm wrong,\" Riddle recalls telling himself. \"Fuck it; I'm going down anyways.\"\n\nHe recalls very clearly when he stepped over a barrier and marched into the Capitol. His friends stopped following him. \"I remember actually seeing politicians from where I was standing,\" he told me. \"I could tell they were scared. I do remember enjoying that.\"\n\nImages of some of the other Capitol invaders soon spread on social media: the Viking-helmeted QAnon Shaman, the man with his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk, the guy carrying the speaker's lectern. Riddle, too, achieved a kind of immortality: He was the insurrectionist hoisting a bottle of wine . In the immediate aftermath of the event, Riddle felt no remorse, or shame, or need to hide. He bragged about his exploits on a local newscast, and briefly enjoyed his newfound virality. He soon received a visit from the FBI.\n\nIn addition to pilfering booze from the Senate parliamentarian's office, Riddle had stolen a leather-bound book labeled Senate Procedure , and quickly hawked it to a fellow rioter for $40. On April 4, 2022, at federal court in Washington, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison. \"Three months for trying to stop the steal, one sip of wine at a time?\" Riddle bragged to a New Hampshire newspaper . \"Totally worth it.\"\n\nEven in prison, he still had his fame-or infamy. He remembers a correctional officer muttering \"Let's go, Brandon\" to him on his first day, he told me, and that his fellow inmates nicknamed him \"Trump.\" But unlike some January 6ers , Riddle wasn't further radicalized in prison, where he spent the summer of 2022. But neither did his conviction immediately lead him to repudiate the cause that had taken him to the Capitol. Riddle talked about running for Congress, leveraging what remained of his fleeting celebrity. He once filed paperwork, but never got any campaign off the ground.\n\nRiddle thought he'd be able to manage his drinking after his release. But he struggled, and soon began attending daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He has relapsed a few times, but thanks largely to what he calls the \"forced intervention\" of his encounter with the criminal-justice system, he's been living his \"new life\" for a little more than two years. Although sobriety remains a daily project, he feels he has finally gained insight into the reckless and self-destructive behavior that led him to the January 6 insurrection.\n\nT hese days , he's working at a restaurant in Concord, New Hampshire. He told me he feels comfortable in chaotic environments, and he's thinking about looking for a job at a hospital or in mental-health services. Sobriety has changed his political perspective, too. Whereas he once viewed Trump as a bold truth teller, raw and unvarnished, he now sees the president as self-serving. When Trump called for public protests around the time of his indictments, Riddle felt especially played. \"And I remember thinking, like, why would he do that? People died at the Capitol riot,\" Riddle said. \"That was the 'duh' moment I had with myself: Well, obviously because he doesn't care about anybody other than himself, and you're an idiot for thinking otherwise. \"\n\nLast fall, he donated to the Kamala Harris campaign, and voted for her in the election. An irony for him, after Trump's reelection, is that he could be reliving his 2021 viral popularity-if he were still willing to exchange his version of reality for Trump's. \"One common thing I always hear is, like, 'Good for you for going down there and expressing your views,'\" he told me. \"People who say that obviously don't understand what they're saying.\"\n\nThe frustration in his voice was audible. \"If I accept this pardon, if I agree to this pardon,\" Riddle told me, \"that means I disagree with that forced intervention.\" Truth has finally collided with the president's lies. Riddle may be enjoying one last hit of attention over his refusal of a pardon, but after the experience this week of seeing the insurrection's ringleaders walk free, unrepentant, he is choosing a different path."

      "text": "The Former Proud Boys Leader Finds Out\n\nEnrique Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison on charges related to January 6.\n\nSay this for the Proud Boys: They abide by their own creed. \"Fuck around, find out!\" members of the group, with Joseph Biggs in front, chanted as they marched down the National Mall, in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021.\n\nOver the past week, they've found out. Enrique Tarrio, the group's former chairman, was sentenced today to 22 years in prison on charges of seditious conspiracy. Tarrio, who was not physically present at the riot after being kicked out of Washington the day before, was convicted in May. It's the longest January 6-related sentence yet, and follows a series of long sentences announced last week for other Proud Boys: 17 years for Biggs, 18 for Ethan Nordean, 15 for Zachary Rehl-all of whom were found guilty of seditious conspiracy-and 10 years for Dominic Pezzola, who was acquitted of sedition but convicted of six other felonies. In May, Stewart Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years for sedition, in his capacity as head of the Oath Keepers, another group involved in the insurrection.\n\nMichael Signer: America does have a way to save itself\n\nSeeing these long sentences levied now, more than two and a half years after the insurrection, is heartening. Hundreds of people have been sentenced for violence and more minor offenses committed at the Capitol, but the Proud Boys' sentences, along with Rhodes's, are more important, because they punish not just spontaneous violence but also a concerted, planned attack on the government.\n\nThe convictions and stiff sentences are a message about what the United States will tolerate. Juries have proved willing to convict even though the charges in question are rare and even though the likely sentences are strong. They also show that juries and judges, and not just prosecutors, are unwilling to treat the insurrection the way too many Republican elected officials have-as just a rally that got a little out of hand.\n\nPolitical scientists call laws that defend democratic institutions from authoritarian threats-and the enforcement of them-\"defensive democracy.\" \"American laws against seditious conspiracy and against advocating for overthrowing the government are quintessential defensive democracy,\" Michael Signer wrote in The Atlantic earlier this year .\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump attempted a brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy\n\nThe Proud Boys leaders have received serious, hard-time sentences, not slaps on the wrist. This is true even though the prison terms are short of both the federal guidelines and what prosecutors requested (33 years for Tarrio and Biggs, 30 for Rehl, 27 for Nordean, 20 for Pezzola). Such sentences would verge on draconian, given the crimes involved: The conspiracy was dangerous and appalling, but also feckless and obviously doomed. (For comparison, Confederate President Jefferson Davis was jailed for two years before being released without trial.) And it's true even if the men don't end up serving the full terms, as is common-though their unrepentant attitudes suggest that they're banking on pardons from a restored President Donald Trump, not early releases.\n\nNotably, for the purposes of a sentence enhancement, Judge Timothy Kelly ruled that the Proud Boys' actions represented terrorism, even as he gave them less time than the guidelines would stipulate. The defendants were aghast. \"I know that I messed up that day, but I am not a terrorist,\" Biggs protested at his sentencing. But Kelly, and common sense, said otherwise. Americans may be accustomed to the idea that terrorists are foreigners, most likely Muslims, but what the Proud Boys did on January 6 amounted to \"the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government or civilian population in furtherance of political or social objectives,\" which happens to be the FBI's textbook definition of terrorism. It doesn't matter that they were American-born or believed that they were in the right.\n\nSpeculating about the deterrent impact of the strict sentences and terrorism label would be premature, but the long sentences will take a direct bite out of the groups. The Proud Boys have since January 6 seemed to shift their efforts into grassroots involvement in local government, which could give them a lasting grip even with their top leadership locked up. The Oath Keepers, which centered around Rhodes, may be in more dire straits .\n\nDavid A. Graham: The paperwork coup\n\nThese are positive indications about the strength of American defensive democracy, but they are not the final answer. Another test will come in the trials of the many people involved in what I call the paperwork coup -the series of extralegal (though often lawyerly) attempts to subvert the 2020 election. Recent indictments from Special Counsel Jack Smith and Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis demonstrate how the various tendrils of this effort were intertwined. They add up to a scheme that was less blatant and less violent than the January 6 riot, but also a greater threat to the integrity of the election system. Will juries and judges recognize that peril, or will they treat it as bumbling paper-pushing?\n\nAlso unresolved is the larger question of Trump. If Tarrio and other Proud Boys deserved to have the book thrown at them, and if the rank-and-file rioters are serving their time, the justice system still hasn't proved whether it can sufficiently hold accountable the man all of this was designed to benefit-and who, if the prosecutors are to be believed, orchestrated much of it. Even as the highest-profile Proud Boys cases are finishing, Trump is only now facing charges in Washington and Fulton County for his own role in the election plot.\n\nFrom the October 2023 issue: The courtroom is a very unhappy place for Donald Trump\n\nWhile those cases slowly ramp up, though, Trump remains the strong favorite for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and would enter a rematch with President Joe Biden with something near even odds at victory. As my colleagues Quinta Jurecic and David Frum have recently pointed out, the best and perhaps only way to contain the danger Trump still poses to the American system is to defeat him at the ballot box-in other words, putting the democracy in defensive democracy."

      "text": "January 6ers Got Out of Prison-And Came to My Neighborhood\n\nThe strange new reality after Trump's pardons\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nOn Monday, Stewart Rhodes, the eye-patched founder of the far-right militia known as the Oath Keepers, was in prison, which is where he has been since he was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. By Tuesday afternoon, he was taking a nap at my neighbors' house.\n\nI learned this when I recently walked past that house, which I've gotten to know well. A couple of years ago, my partner and I discovered that it was a kind of refuge for January 6ers. The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed during the riot, lives there, along with Nicole Reffitt, the wife of a Texas man who brought a gun to the Capitol grounds. Occasionally, a young January 6 defendant named Brandon Fellows stays at the house too. We got used to seeing them around the neighborhood, which, like most of Washington, D.C., is heavily Democratic. Before the election, the house was decorated with Christmas lights and the lawn with Trump signs, and no one complained. But on day one of Donald Trump's new presidency, something came loose.\n\nStrangers in MAGA hats and scarves started showing up with suitcases. Someone egged the house, twice. Fellows's motorcycle was stolen. Although it was freezing on Tuesday, lots of people were on the porch, people I didn't recognize. I spotted Fellows outside, wearing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement jacket, his version of a sartorial troll. \"We were at breakfast with Stewart,\" he said. \"He's taking a nap real quick.\"\n\nListen: Even some J6ers don't agree with Trump's blanket pardon\n\nRhodes is among the most infamous J6ers for a reason. For years, he recruited and cultivated a militant group to resist government tyranny. His estranged ex-wife recently said she fears that she and some of her kids are on his \"kill list\" (lawyers for Rhodes denied this). In 2023, he was sentenced to 18 years for plotting to thwart the peaceful transfer of power on January 6.\n\nWhen I ran into Fellows, Rhodes had just been released from prison, after Trump had pardoned more than 1,500 January 6 defendants in his first hours back in office. Trump had repeatedly promised that the pardons were coming, but the fact that he included those charged with the most serious crimes came as a surprise. In effect, he chose not to distinguish between the mildly and the severely dangerous-people who demonstrated terrible judgment on one day, getting swept up in a mob, versus those who had planned to carry out violence, for example. (Rhodes, however, was one of 14 individuals granted a commutation, meaning his sentence was erased, but he did not have all his rights restored.)\n\nIn the past year, I spoke with many January 6ers and their families as my partner, Lauren Ober, and I made a podcast about our neighbors' house. I know how their lives have been upended by the prosecutions, and so I understand that, for many of them, day one was some kind of setting things right. Many of them absorbed Trump's framing: They thought of their loved ones as actual hostages, held by the government. \"Today, we are a free country,\" I heard one tearful father of a January 6er say outside the D.C. jail on Monday night as he waited for his son to be released.\n\nIn an instant, thousands of families were living a day they'd feared would never come. But in Donald Trump's America, one person's order restored is another person's lawless abandon.\n\nIn our podcast , my partner and I followed the story of Marie Johnatakis, whose husband, Taylor, had been serving a seven-year sentence in a federal prison in Springfield, Missouri. Three weeks ago, when her world was still in chaos, Marie bought a one-way ticket home for Taylor, back to Seattle. Her daughter kept cautioning her that politicians don't keep their promises-that Trump wouldn't follow through on the pardons he campaigned on-but Marie is an optimist. On Tuesday night, she sent me a picture of her and Taylor an hour after she had picked him up from prison. They sat side by side, smiling, like in a Christmas-card photo. I asked her if it would be hard to adjust to him being home but she said no; it would be seamless. Taylor has written each of their five children one letter a week from prison, and read them books over the phone. Family harmony will be restored, Marie believes, and so will the rightness of all things.\n\n\"I mean, this started with January 6, four years ago, and we were the scum of the Earth. We were 'domestic terrorists.' We were, you know, like, we were people that you were supposed to be afraid of. And then the January 6 committee and all of that, and every time Trump had anything with criminal charges,\" she told me. \"He's not a savior,\" she said of Trump. \"But for a lot of us, this is a miracle. A lot of us feel like it was one miracle after another.\"\n\nRead: Republican leaders once thought January 6 was 'tragic'\n\nBefore taking office for a second time, Trump sometimes said he would pardon defendants on a case-by-case basis. I spoke with Republican lawyers who mentioned the idea of a review board, a Justice Department committee that might evaluate cases such as Taylor's. His was a middling case; he was not among the several hundred people convicted solely of misdemeanors, such as trespassing and disorderly conduct, but nor was he among the small group convicted of seditious conspiracy. His charges involved using a megaphone to yell \"One, two, three, go!\" and lead a crowd to push a barricade into a row of police officers. In an alternative version of reality in which Trump had smashed history with slightly more finesse, lawyers might have debated in a room about which degrees of \"assault\" qualified which people for pardons, and you can imagine how Taylor might have won his freedom. But instead Trump chose a blanket pardon. Now the QAnon Shaman is posting about how excited he is to \"BUY SOME MOTHA FU*KIN GUNS!!!\"\n\nWhen I walked by my neighbors' house on Tuesday afternoon, Nicole Reffitt, the wife of the man who was sentenced for bringing a gun to the Capitol, was outside too, being interviewed by a Dutch news crew. Her husband, Guy, was about to get out of jail, and the family would move back to Texas. But unlike Marie Johnatakis, Nicole seemed unsettled. Not all January 6ers are happy about the pardons. One woman, known as \"MAGA Granny,\" has said she doesn't deserve a pardon and plans to complete her probation.\n\nNicole can think of a few defendants she believes don't deserve one. \" I'm a law-and-order gal, really,\" she told me. \"And so not all charges should be gone there. People did really bad things that day.\" In many people's minds, her husband was one of them, even though he didn't enter the Capitol or use his gun. She told me she was thinking of someone like Jacob Lang, who was captured on video swinging a baseball bat at police officers and thrusting a riot shield in their direction, according to an affidavit . At that moment, Lang, whose case never went to trial, was at the D.C. jail still waiting for his release, growing impatient. \"These tyrannical animals will not stop and we need President Trump to get these men released ASAP!!!!!\" someone posted on Monday from Lang's X account. He was released Tuesday night.\n\nOutside the D.C. jail on Monday and Tuesday, the former inmates were not quite running the asylum, but they were enchanting the crowd outside. So far, the 22 January 6ers held at the D.C. jail have been released slowly, a handful each day, but it has become a gathering place for the recently released from all over the country. On Tuesday night, Robert Morss , known as \" Lego Man \" because authorities found a Lego replica of the Capitol at his house, was a crowd favorite. Camera crews from Sweden, Japan, and Norway broadcast from outside the jail. Whenever Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song\" came on the speakers, the crowd belted it out.\n\nOn Tuesday night, I caught a glimpse of Rhodes at the edge of the crowd, giving an interview to a right-wing YouTuber. \"It's a day of celebration,\" he said. \"When President Trump was inaugurated, it was awesome. You know, like he said himself, God saved him to save America, and I believe that's true. And then he turned around and saved us last night.\" Rhodes's only complaint was that he'd been given a commutation; he told the interviewer he was applying for a pardon. \" I think everyone deserves a pardon, without any, without any exception,\" he said. \"It's impossible to get a fair trial here if you're a Trump supporter ... So if you have no chance of a fair trial, then you should be presumed innocent. That's put back in your natural state, which is an innocent and free human being.\" (Rhodes declined to talk with me.)\n\nThat's the view of January 6 that follows naturally from the pardons: They were sham trials. It was actually a day of peace. Trump and his allies are likely to push this revised version of history for the next four years. House Speaker Mike Johnson has already announced that he will form a select subcommittee on January 6, \"to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people.\"\n\nRead: Trump's pardons are sending a crystal-clear message\n\nHere is the truth. Prosecuting January 6ers did not require delicate forensics. Tens of thousands of hours of video show rioters beating up police with whatever tools are at hand. Five people died during the insurrection and in its immediate aftermath, and four police officers later died by suicide. Some 140 officers were assaulted, and many could never work again. This week, a retired officer, Michael Fanone, told Rhodes to go fuck himself live on CNN , and said he was worried for his safety and that of his family. Fanone is surely not alone. I think of the hundreds of D.C. citizens who served as jurors in January 6 cases that are now overturned, and the judges who presided over them.\n\nWhen he sentenced Taylor Johnatakis, Judge Royce Lamberth wrote: \"Political violence rots republics. Therefore, January 6 must not become a precedent for further violence against political opponents or governmental institutions.\" Lamberth, who is 81 and whose wife died a few months ago, had a couple of new January 6 cases due to start this week, a father and son, but they have disappeared from the docket. In his sentencing letter for Johnatakis's case, he wrote, \"This is not normal.\" I wanted to ask him about the pardons but did not get a response from his office.\n\nIn our conversation, Marie Johnatakis referred to Lamberth as one of the \"sweet judges,\" and she meant it earnestly. I've known her for more than a year, and she is a gentle person. But her critique of him, although kindly delivered, is a radical one. She compared Lamberth to Javert, the prosecutor in Les Miserables . In her view, the judge is so rigidly attached to the law that he can't see the deeper truth, which is that a good man like her husband should not have gone to jail.\n\nShe and Taylor fly home today. The kids, she told me, will be making them dinner."

      "text": "A Sweeping January 6 Pardon Is an Attack on the Judiciary\n\nThe federal judges who stewarded these cases deserve more respect than that.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nDonald Trump's repeated promise to consider pardons for the January 6 attackers is rightly seen as a craven political move, one that would both satiate his base and bolster the lie that the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol was a peaceful protest, and that those who have been charged and convicted are political prisoners or even \" hostages .\" But the promise is something graver too: Blanket pardons for the January 6 rioters would be a severe assault on the legitimacy of the criminal legal system, and in particular, on the role of the judiciary in that system.\n\nSince January 6, 2021, the federal judges of the district court in Washington, D.C., have worked tirelessly to handle the nearly 1,600 criminal cases brought by the U.S. Department of Justice against those who allegedly attacked police officers, damaged and stole government property, caused members of Congress and the vice president of the United States to flee for their lives, and prevented the counting of the Electoral College ballots for more than six hours. The charged crimes have ranged from misdemeanors such as trespassing and disorderly conduct to serious felonies such as assaulting police, obstructing an official proceeding, and seditious conspiracy.\n\nIn every case, federal judges have worked to ensure that the defendant's constitutional rights have been protected, including the rights to counsel, due process of law, and a jury trial. More than 1,000 of those charged have pleaded guilty. More than 250 have been found guilty after a trial. More than 800 have received sentences of incarceration, including some who were permitted to serve their sentences in home detention. Others have received sentences of probation. And through it all, the federal judges-whether appointed by a Republican president, a Democratic president, or former President Trump himself-have devoted themselves to carefully stewarding their cases in accordance with U.S. law.\n\nTom Nichols: Trump's dangerous January 6-pardon promise\n\nThis has required thousands of hours of intense, difficult work. These judges have seen the evidence over and over again-seen their fellow Americans beat police with baseball bats and flagpoles, erect a gallows to hang the vice president, scale the walls of the Capitol and break through its windows, and brag about their insurrection on social media. They have sentenced some who are contrite and remorseful, and many others who remain defiant and unapologetic, amplifying the lies about January 6. Regardless of political affiliation, the judges have been uniform in condemning the acts of those convicted in their courtrooms.\n\nAs Royce C. Lamberth, a Republican-appointed judge with nearly 40 years on the bench, said at the sentencing of a January 6 defendant:\n\nThe Court cannot condone the shameless attempts by [the defendant] or anyone else to misinterpret or misrepresent what happened. It cannot condone the notion that those who broke the law on January 6 did nothing wrong, or that those duly convicted with all the safeguards of the United States Constitution, including a right to trial by jury in felony cases, are political prisoners or hostages.\n\nSo let me set the record straight, based on what I've learned presiding over many January 6 prosecutions, hearing from dozens of witnesses, watching hundreds of hours of video footage, and reading thousands of pages of evidence. On January 6, 2021, a mob of people invaded and occupied the United States Capitol, using force to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power mandated by the Constitution and our republican heritage ...\n\nAlthough the rioters failed in their ultimate goal, their actions nonetheless resulted in the deaths of multiple people, injury to over 140 members of law enforcement, and lasting trauma for our entire nation.  This was not patriotism; it was the antithesis of patriotism.\n\nThese same judges, many of whom have been threatened with violence by supporters of the January 6 defendants, are now being asked by those appearing before them to postpone their proceedings , including their sentencings , because Donald Trump has promised to pardon them. For the most part, the judges have remained firm and pressed ahead. As Judge Reggie B. Walton, another Republican-appointed judge, noted , \"The potential future exercise of the discretionary pardon power, an Executive Branch authority, is irrelevant to the Court's obligation to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Judicial Branch.\" Judge Carl J. Nichols, who was appointed by Trump, lamented that \"blanket pardons for all January 6 defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing,\" though he added that it wasn't his \"call\" and agreed to reschedule a jury trial from late 2024 to after the inauguration.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig: Pardon Trump's critics now\n\nThe judicial branch is an integral part of our country's criminal legal system. Federal judges in the nation's district courts must ensure that every defendant before them is treated fairly and afforded the same constitutional rights. It is their responsibility to dispense justice not only to those with means, or to those in the president's favor, but to those who are indigent and far out of favor. And in my experience as a former federal prosecutor for nearly 20 years, most defendants respect the judges who handle their case and accept the sentence imposed on them.\n\nSome defendants who have been sentenced by a federal judge later receive clemency-either a pardon or commutation of sentence-from the president. This act of mercy is sometimes granted to defendants who have accepted responsibility and changed their life for the better while serving their sentence. Sometimes it is used when sentencing practices have changed dramatically, making sentences imposed long ago seem draconian. But it would be an all-out assault on our criminal legal system, and on the role of the judiciary in that system, to issue blanket pardons to the January 6 attackers regardless of the seriousness of their crimes, their remorse (or lack thereof), and their actions post-January 6. These federal judges deserve more respect than that."

      "text": "The Far Right Is Splintering\n\nIn his trial, the Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes turned against other extremists.\n\nAs Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Stewart Rhodes yesterday to 18 years in prison-the longest yet for a defendant involved in the January 6 insurrection-he explained why the leader of the far-right group the Oath Keepers needed to be behind bars for a long time. \"You pose an ongoing threat and peril to our democracy and the fabric of this country,\" Mehta told Rhodes .\n\nMehta was right about that. At his sentencing, Rhodes was unrepentant. In a 20-minute speech before the court, he portrayed himself alternately as a character in Kafka's The Trial ; as an \"American Solzhenitsyn,\" after the Soviet dissident writer who was sent to the gulag; and as a misunderstood advocate for peace. This monologue was standard fare for Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate who likes to align himself with literary heavyweights and historical leaders.\n\nAnd yet Rhodes also unwittingly revealed deepening fissures in the far-right movement that, two years ago, resorted to violence to keep Donald Trump in the White House. The defendant used some of his time to distance himself from the Proud Boys , another extremist organization, with whom he had met in the days before the insurrection. \"Unlike other groups like the Proud Boys, who seek conflict and seek to street-fight,\" Rhodes explained , \"we deter.\" I've been misunderstood , he was telling the court; the Proud Boys are the ones you want .\n\nRhodes, it seems, is not entirely in sync with his radical brethren. A unified extremist front is a threat to our democracy-but the story is different when extremists start pointing fingers at one another in the criminal-justice system.\n\nFrom the November 2020 issue: A pro-Trump militant group has recruited thousands of police, soldiers, and veterans\n\nThe rift between the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers has been simmering for years, and it hasn't kept them from collaborating in the past. In 2019, the two groups arrived in Portland, Oregon, to support far-right protests. Rhodes pulled his group, he later claimed, after learning that white nationalists were involved in the demonstrations. Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, was outraged. Tarrio-who has also been found guilty of seditious conspiracy for January 6-and Rhodes remained at odds even as they coordinated efforts for the insurrection , including at a secret meeting in a parking garage the night before.\n\nBoth testified before the congressional committee investigating January 6 and spoke at length of the division between them. \"I didn't like Stewart Rhodes. I still don't like Stewart Rhodes,\" Tarrio told the panel. The Oath Keepers, Rhodes insisted, are \" quiet professionals \" who believe that Trump won a second term. The Proud Boys believe the same about Trump, Rhodes said, but are \"sloppy\" and have been infiltrated by racists.\n\nWhether such distinctions are real matters less than the fact that the rift appears to be deepening. On January 6, a variety of groups put aside their differences, but solidarity is difficult to sustain. As prosecutions continue and participants in the insurrection try to save themselves, divisions within the far right over ideology and strategy-as well as conflicts driven by pure ego-are reasserting themselves .\n\nOver time, mismanagement and general pettiness distract many extremist groups from their cause. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State similarly devolved into catfights as they lost on battlefields. Rhodes, who imagines himself an intellectual, appears to feel tarnished by alliances with mere racists. That he would defend himself in court by complaining about the Proud Boys signals to would-be followers that he's self-absorbed, not that he's sacrificing himself for noble cause. An effective way to combat right-wing extremism is to put its leaders' selfishness on display.\n\nDavid A. Graham: It was sedition\n\nViolence, of course, clearly remains a threat to our democracy. The day before Rhodes was sentenced, the Department of Homeland Security warned of a \" heightened threat environment \" in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. This week, a man carrying a Nazi flag and praising Hitler rammed his U-Haul into a security barrier protecting the White House.\n\nViolent, noxious ideologies do not just vanish with a tough sentence. Success against them can't be measured by whether bad people see the light, but whether they are able to expand their ranks. Raising money and organizing large-scale collective actions become more difficult if seemingly like-minded groups are at war with each other. Far-right groups make noise about left-wing conspiracies, but they are under attack from within their own cause.\n\nRhodes will have 18 years to contemplate the violence and stew in his resentment of the Proud Boys. In the meantime, let the infighting continue."

      "text": "What I Saw on the January 6 Committee\n\nThe attack on the Capitol was never a single, isolated event, but the outburst of a movement that is still fighting.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nD ays after the January 6 attack on the Capitol , I joined the legal team supporting Representative Jamie Raskin and the other House managers as they prepared for President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. At that point, relatively little was known about the origins of the attack. What was visible to us, as we scrambled to draft a presentation to the Senate, was a grim yet simple truth: Trump had set a violent mob upon Congress in order to stay in power. Later, I became part of the House January 6 select committee as an investigative counsel on a team examining how domestic violent extremism had contributed to the insurrection.\n\nIn those two roles, I was at the front lines of congressional efforts to make sense of the attack. Throughout these investigations, the question I wanted to answer wasn't so much what had happened on January 6 itself-that was clear enough to me-but what the insurrection could become , if we failed to contain the forces that had fueled it. I saw firsthand why we cannot remember the insurrection as only a dangerous anomaly or an ideologically agnostic moment of chaos, whipped up by a repugnant but vapid ex-president. It was the manifestation of an organized and growing authoritarian movement that seeks to shatter our pluralistic society.\n\nTwo years after my service on the select committee, I am still haunted by what I heard in the interviews and depositions I conducted with my team, which brought me face-to-face with Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other extremists. Witnesses described a genuine fascist ideology taking root in modern America, one that presents itself as a savior of our democracy even as it seeks to demolish it. I saw in those depositions glimpses of an America that has no place for me-a gay, Jewish man-and an America where the rule of law is forever threatened by the possibility of violence.\n\nWorking on the impeachment-trial team, I remember thinking that my legal research was unequal to the task before us. There was nothing in the record of past impeachments that came close to the high crimes we were trying to explain. A string of 19th-century improprieties -more Teapot Dome than Beer Hall Putsch -were largely mini scandals compared with Trump's attempted coup.\n\nAs I researched, I realized that some of the most helpful analogues came from abroad. I kept returning to the theory offered by the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, with whom I'd worked the prior year on a briefing to the Oversight Committee about Trump's authoritarian response to violent unrest in Portland, Oregon . Snyder placed Trump's Big Lie in the context of earlier fascist attempts to consolidate power. Moreover, he stated plainly what too many have downplayed: that the Big Lie hinged on the belief that Black and brown Americans-especially those living in large, Democratic cities-are not equal to their white peers. An essential element of Trump's unending stolen-election conspiracy is that it was a fraud perpetrated by corrupt Democrats who leveraged the votes of communities of color in places such as Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Detroit-that something about those votes was fishy or illegitimate.\n\nThe Trump administration's failure to stop the insurrection on January 6 is one piece of a story of democratic decline into racial authoritarianism, a path our country has walked before . Understanding this helped me unify the multiple instances of incitement we highlighted at the impeachment trial: Trump's equivocation after Charlottesville, his menacing of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, his televised command to the Proud Boys.\n\nIt was obvious where this incitement had led. In the trial's final stretch, I sifted through gruesome security footage and amateur videos that the managers would use in making their case. In the clips, you can hear warlike cries of fealty to Trump and shouts of officers as they are overwhelmed by the mob.\n\nBut these events seemed to have had little bearing on the eventual verdict. Senate Republicans acquitted Trump from behind a fig-leaf procedural excuse : that the Constitution gave them no authority to convict a president once he left office. Senators couched their acquittal votes in meaningless rhetorical rebukes of Trump. By treating Trump and January 6 as ugly aberrations, many people seemed eager to rebrand the insurrection as a classic tale of American trial and triumph. The Republic endured. Donald Trump was no longer president. We were safe.\n\nM y first days on the select committee , nearly a year after the impeachment effort wrapped, gave me unpleasant déjà vu as I again dove into the muck of January 6. I spent much of 2022 sitting with my teammates in conference rooms-or at home, on one end of a committee Webex, which we used for virtual witnesses-interviewing and deposing members of paramilitary groups and others who were connected to the attack on the Capitol. With each conversation, a fuller portrait of the insurrection emerged. This portrait stood in stark contrast to the one being painted by Trump loyalists, in Congress and elsewhere, who were eager to dismiss the attack as a tourist jaunt , a legitimate protest , or a one-off misadventure . Although a less sweeping view of January 6 might give Americans a false sense of security-and allow Trumpists and their apologists to shrug off whatever residual shame they feel-it denies the truth of our investigation.\n\nTo many of the witnesses I deposed, January 6 was justified-and vigilantism more generally is justifiable-when the values of inclusive American democracy fail to align with their own authoritarian mindset, which prioritizes hierarchy and traditionalism, and identifies danger in difference. As one Proud Boy told us, his brethren might \"strive to be law-abiding citizens,\" but when laws infringe on things such as \"religious values,\" it is \"incumbent\" on the Proud Boys to \"react\" and \"in some way rebel when the government becomes tyrannical.\"\n\nThe Capitol was not the only target of this rage. I had far-ranging conversations with current and former Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Christian nationalists, and QAnon adherents, who explained what had propelled them to January 6 and beyond: anger against racial-justice protesters, who they believed \"just burn down buildings and loot small businesses\" because \"that's what they do\"; paranoia about how LGBTQ people are trying to \"twist human nature\"; conspiratorial hatred , tinged with anti-Semitic tropes, of \"elite globalists who are trying to take over the United States\" and are the \"big picture\" enemy. The only way to view our evidence was as part of a broader pattern of antidemocratic violence motivated by racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and misogyny.\n\nThis vision began to come into focus just a few days after I started, when my team conducted the depositions of Enrique Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes , the men who had led the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, respectively, on their paths to January 6. The two have since been convicted of seditious conspiracy . Hearing their testimony, I already saw cracks in the narrow conception of January 6 as an awful but isolated day. Rhodes fervently explained that the Oath Keepers had been ready for Trump to call on them during the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, months before the election. Tarrio boasted that the Proud Boys remain \"activists.\"\n\nDuring the months that followed, I looked more closely at the faces of American extremism and saw a cogent worldview staring back at me. Witnesses parroted almost verbatim Trump's vilification of heavily nonwhite cities and rattled off conspiracies that reduced Black Lives Matter protesters to violent puppets of shadow elites. My team regularly recognized in these conversations markers of the \"Great Replacement\" theory , a white-supremacist conspiracy theory that claims that a largely Jewish elite class is manipulating Black and brown people in order to overpower white, Christian America. This belief-which has already motivated multiple attacks that have resulted in mass death-became a prism through which much of our collected testimony made sense.\n\nIn early March, I sat in a poorly heated conference room in the O'Neill House Office Building, just a few steps from the Capitol, as I listened to our witness du jour: Patrick Casey , a former leader of the white-supremacist Groyper network, who explained how \"massive multiethnic societies ... have devolved into conflict and tension.\" His words rattled in my head a few days later, when the same Proud Boy who'd said that January 6 was people fighting back \"a little bit\" went on to fulsomely defend the Capitol siege as a show of force by heroic guardians of traditional Western morality .\n\nThese rationalizations of violence and bigotry became so commonplace that I risked losing sight of their significance. But downplaying them became impossible the afternoon I sat down again in that same conference room, this time for an interview with Jason Van Tatenhove , a former Oath Keeper propagandist. I asked him why he thought Donald Trump was so important to Rhodes, the Oath Keepers' founder. He explained that Rhodes had always hoped that a strong right-wing leader would invite the Oath Keepers to be a praetorian guard to smash ideological opponents and enforce public order. My mind flashed to the ascendant SS in Weimar Germany and the secret police of Pinochet's Chile-two cases where paramilitary fighters were invited by political leaders to engage in extrajudicial violence to conquer their enemies and cleanse their society without fear of consequences.\n\nAs we continued to collect evidence and conduct interviews, I became only more convinced that Americans were deeply unaware of the enduring threat of violence-and its dangerous proximity to the political mainstream. Later that spring, we obtained text messages showing eager coordination between Rhodes and Robert Weaver, one of the two co-founders of the Jericho March , an election-denying coalition that embraced Christian-nationalist language and had staged an event in Washington, D.C., in mid-December 2020 that was a key precursor to the insurrection. The other Jericho March co-founder, Arina Grossu, told me in an interview that Black Lives Matter and election fraud were twin threats \"destructive to the fabric of America.\" Both individuals were Trump-administration employees on January 6 .\n\nAround the same time, we deposed a North Carolina paramilitary leader, who appeared on-screen with a semiautomatic rifle hanging behind him. He clearly had no appetite for the deposition, but soon he was warning us about the murderous intent of the Three Percenters, who had become too extreme even for him. He worried that militias would cause more violence in 2024 at voting precincts that \"they assumed to be fraudulent.\" Political tolerance of extremism was fueling an unending vigilante fantasy.\n\nOf course, none of these witnesses proclaimed themselves to be foot soldiers of authoritarianism. They believed themselves to be the good guys, who were obeying Donald Trump's command to rescue America from evil forces that had stolen the election and corrupted our society. And during these hours-long exchanges, it was impossible not to sometimes glimpse charming details on the other end of the Webex. Kellye SoRelle , a lawyer for the Oath Keepers, asked us to pause her deposition so she could feed her cat breakfast. Yet by the end of our session, she was ranting about how a \"Jewish\" intelligence operation was a mechanism to \"further the agenda for global groups\" and undermine American sovereignty.\n\nPerhaps the most frightening moment came in early June, when I deposed James Watkins, a man who, along with his son Ron , is widely thought to be at the inner core of the QAnon conspiracy theory . (Both have denied being Q.) I began by asking Watkins about the number of visitors to their website, 8kun , which is known for doxxing campaigns, white-supremacist content, and the occasional mass-shooter manifesto . He said that although traffic to the site varies, it would be higher that day. When I asked why, he whispered forebodingly: \"Because they know I'm talking to you.\"\n\nDuring my tenure on the committee, a regular staccato of political and targeted violence echoed in the background of our investigation: a far-right killing of a racial-justice protester in Portland, Oregon; a white-supremacist massacre at a supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York; a neo-Nazi plot against an Idaho Pride parade; a mass shooting by a violent Trump supporter at the July 4 celebration of a heavily Jewish Chicago suburb; an attack on the FBI after Trump denounced its search of Mar-a-Lago; an attempted kidnapping of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a hammer attack on her husband by a Big Lie believer .\n\nThen, the weekend after I finished my work on the select committee, a shooter with radical beliefs he'd picked up in far-right online spaces opened fire at an LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs. When I learned the news, I thought immediately of our depositions: snide comments by Proud Boys about the need to defend traditional families, imagined conspiracies in which LGBTQ people acted as yet another arm of sinister elites.\n\nThese atrocities reminded me, again and again, that the story of January 6 was not over. I knew that their perpetrators-like the insurrectionists I deposed-were part of something much bigger, something ongoing. Our witnesses expressed a clear vision of the society they wanted, one in which the progress of the late 20th century-on race, sexual orientation, gender, and religious tolerance-would be undone, by force if necessary. These attacks, like January 6 itself, were fitful attempts to make this nightmare a reality.\n\nT hree and a half years after January 6, Donald Trump is aiming to return to the White House, propelled by openly fascist promises . Following his guilty verdict in New York, Trump's tirades against the rule of law sparked a fresh wave of insurrectionary threats from his supporters, providing a hint of the dangers that could again emerge if he embarks on another sustained and targeted campaign of incitement. Then, on the debate stage , Trump embraced Capitol rioters as \"innocent\" and refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election-a clear indication that he remains willing to court fascistic violence in order to regain power. Days later, the Supreme Court virtually guaranteed that Trump will be free to stoke more violence from the Oval Office, which prompted a leading architect of his second-term agenda to threaten violence in order to achieve a Trump-led \"second American Revolution.\" Since then, Trump has amplified social-media posts embracing QAnon, called for the jailing of his political opponents, and threatened violence against immigrants.\n\nThis dynamic, which mirrors the slow burn toward insurrection that I explored on the select committee, should terrify every American who loves our democracy. Another Trump presidency will invite more hatred and violence targeting not only our democratic infrastructure but also members of vulnerable groups not welcome in the intolerant society that extremists are trying to bring into existence . The insurrection still inspires adherents of this cause . America is still fighting off the January 6 attack, because the attackers themselves are still fighting for their vision of America-one that extends far beyond the steps of the Capitol."

It is the longest sentence handed down so far to any participant in the January 6 insurrection, when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the halls of Congress to stop the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential victory. One of Rhodes's associates, Kelly Meggs, who led the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison. A jury had convicted both men of seditious conspiracy in November. The sentences are a \"substantial win for democracy,\" says Kristen Doerer, who reports on right-wing extremism and followed the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The far-right founder of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy for plotting to keep Donald Trump in power after the 2020 election, resulting in the deadly January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. It's the longest sentence handed down so far for anyone tied to the insurrection. One of Rhodes' associates, Kelly Meggs, who led the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison. A jury had convicted both men of seditious conspiracy in November.\n\nFollowing Joe Biden's defeat of Trump in November 2020, Rhodes told his followers, quote, \"We are not getting through this without a civil war,\" unquote. Federal prosecutors had accused Rhodes of playing a key role in planning the January 6th insurrection, even though he did not enter the Capitol. Prosecutors described him as a, quote, \"general overlooking a battlefield while his troops stormed inside.\"\n\nDuring Thursday's sentencing, Stewart Rhodes wore an orange prison jumpsuit and claimed he was a political prisoner. Judge Amit Mehta rebuked Rhodes, saying, quote, \"What we absolutely cannot have is a group of citizens who, because they did not like the outcome of the election, were then prepared to take up arms and ordered to foment a revolution. That's what you did,\" the judge said. The Justice Department had sought a 25-year sentence.\n\nWe're joined now by Kristen Doerer. She's an independent journalist covering right-wing extremism.\n\nKristen, first respond to this verdict, both for Stewart Rhodes - and talk about who he is - and his associate.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Thanks for having me.\n\nYeah, this was a very substantial win for democracy. This was - 18 years is a very long time for Stewart Rhodes to be in prison, and it sends a strong message of deterrence to anybody else who is considering doing - trying to overthrow the government again in 2024 or in future years.\n\nSo, Stewart Rhodes is the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers organization. And so, the Oath Keepers is an anti-government extremist organization founded in 2009, and they have this idea that they're protecting the United States from the federal government. And so they have always, you know, been willing and ready to defy the federal government. And they have heavily recruited from military, former military members, and police officers. And they have had as many as 40,000 people on their membership rolls, though likely they've only had a few thousand people as members at a time.\n\nAnd I will say that they've always been very conspiratorial in tone, and they - you know, leaders of the Oath Keepers, like Stewart Rhodes, have suggested that the federal government has been taken over by global elites and that they want to put Americans in concentration camps. So, this is a very conspiratorial, far-right, extremist anti-government organization.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, this is the most severe and longest penalty of over a thousand criminal cases stemming from the Capitol attack?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Yes, this is the most - this is the longest sentence. Before that, it was one other man who had, I think, up to 32 prior convictions and had assaulted police officers, and he was given 14 years. And Kelly Meggs, who you mentioned earlier, the leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, was sentenced to 12 years, which is now the third longest. This really sends a strong message of deterrence. It also sends a message to those who are still waiting for their sentencing who have been convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the fact that Stewart Rhodes wore that orange prison jumpsuit, and the fact that he is saying he is a political prisoner, what he said in the courtroom?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Yeah. So, this - you know, this is exactly what he's been doing since he's been in prison. You know, he has said that he is a political prisoner - and I don't want to mess up this quote, so let me just take a quick look at it - but that he promised to, quote, \"expose the criminality of this regime\" while he was in prison - while he is in prison. And these are still things that he has said during his time waiting to be sentenced. You know, he has said that the election was stolen, which it was not. And he has, you know, said that his only crime is having different political views. But we very well know that he was plotting and planning for a violent overthrow of the U.S. government, and he was just waiting for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act before they brought weapons to the Capitol.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : According to The New York Times , it's also - this sentencing is the first to be increased for fitting the legal definition of terrorism?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Yeah. So, you know, this is something that I think prosecutors were going after when they were seeking that 25-year sentencing. You know, seditious conspiracy holds a charge of 20 years, and so this was something that prosecutors were trying to put, you know, Stewart Rhodes in jail for for a longer period of time. And this is something that, you know, the judge recognized.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During a recent town hall, CNN town hall, former President Trump said if he's elected again, he'd be inclined to pardon many of the insurrectionists. The CNN host, Kaitlan Collins, also asked Trump if he had any regrets about his actions on January 6th. This was his response.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : January 6th, it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken to. That was prior to the walk down to the Capitol building. I don't think - and I've spoken to hundreds of thousands of people. I've never spoken to a crowd as large as this. And that was because they thought the election was rigged. And they were there proud. They were there with love in their heart. That was an unbelievable, and it was a beautiful day. And what I was asked to do - I wasn't involved in it very much. I was asked to come in: Would I make a speech? I made a speech. I said, \"Walk peacefully and patriotically,\" you know, many different things.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you respond to this, Kristen Doerer?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Yeah, it's a bit - it's unsurprising, in some ways. I mean, we saw, immediately after January 6, Trump, you know - or even during January 6, Trump not wanting to tell the protesters to go home. He has always remained very loyal to those who are unapologetically and loudly for him. And I think he saw the Oath Keepers as tools, as allies, in a certain sense.\n\nAnd I think he also, you know, is going to say that he's going to pardon these political - or, these - he's going to pardon these people whom he calls political prisoners, in an effort to hold onto his base and to gin up enthusiasm. There's been a major rewrite among the far right and among even the Republican Party to rewrite January 6 into not a national tragedy but a political protest that got out of hand.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, the far right likes to call this an inside job, what happened on the day, on the January 6th insurrection. The FBI reportedly got a tip about Oath Keepers' plans for armed fight in November of 2020. This was well before January 6th. We just have 30 seconds. Why wasn't this stopped then?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : You know, this is one of the most frustrating things. You know, even right-wing - researchers for counterextremism, researchers and reporters, have been seeing this violent rhetoric, this - you know, all this activity around January 6. And, you know, there was bad communications, it appears, between the different government agencies. And there were certain people who didn't take these threats seriously. And that's something that we've seen time and time again, where when it comes to right-wing extremists, those threats are not always taken seriously.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Kristen Doerer, I want to thank you for being with us, independent journalist covering right-wing extremism.\n\nComing up, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones and the Oscar-winning filmmaker Spike Lee on the legacy of Malcolm X, the making of the film, and the power of history.

The men could face decades in prison for their actions. A fifth defendant was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but convicted on other charges. We look at the Proud Boys, their role in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and where the extremist group goes from here, with HuffPost senior editor Andy Campbell, author of We Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In a New Era of American Extremism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A jury in Washington, D.C., has convicted four members of the far-right group Proud Boys of seditious conspiracy for their role in the January 6th insurrection and for attempting to keep Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. The jury convicted Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, along with Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean and Zachary Rehl, on sedition, which could carry a sentence of nearly 50 years in prison. A fifth Proud Boy, Dominic Pezzola, was found not guilty of sedition, but he was convicted with the others of numerous felonies, including obstructing an official proceeding and obstructing Congress. During two previous trials, six members of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers, were also convicted of sedition.\n\nThe verdicts are seen as a major victory for the Justice Department. Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke Thursday.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND : Today's verdict makes clear that the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy. ...\n\nOver the past two years, the department has secured more than 600 convictions for a wide range of criminal conduct on January 6th, as well as in the days and weeks leading up to the attack. ...\n\nAnd now, after three trials, we have secured the convictions of leaders of both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers for seditious conspiracy, specifically conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power. Our work will continue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During the trial, federal prosecutors described the Proud Boys as \"Donald Trump's army,\" saying they were, quote, \"lined up behind Donald Trump and willing to commit violence on his behalf,\" unquote.\n\nAttorneys for the Proud Boys attempted to shift the blame for January 6 solely on the former president. Defense attorney Nayib Hassan told jurors, quote, \"It was Donald Trump's words. It was his motivation. It was his anger that caused what occurred on January 6th in your beautiful and amazing city. It was not Enrique Tarrio. They want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and those in power,\" he said.\n\nTarrio was convicted even though he was not in Washington during the insurrection. He had been arrested days earlier in another criminal case.\n\nWe're joined now by Andy Campbell, senior editor at HuffPost . His book is titled We Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In a New Era of American Extremism .\n\nStart off, Andy, by talking about the significance of these verdicts, four verdicts, guilty verdicts for suspicious conspiracy.\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Right. It's a hard bar to cross, because not only did prosecutors have to prove that the Proud Boys impeded or opposed the government by force, but that they had an agreement to do so beforehand. And that last bit was a difficult bar for them to cross. But the prosecutors put together a strong case against them and proved that the Proud Boys did have an agreement, even on the day, to storm the Capitol.\n\nThis charge is, historically, brought against terrorists on American soil. And prior to January 6th, the last successful prosecution was against Islamic militants who were threatening to blow up the U.N. So, this is the government saying, \"We are very serious,\" and this trial is a bookend to its two highest-profile cases for January 6 against the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And how does this affect the overall trials of the January 6 defendants? I mean, we're talking about over a thousand people have been arrested.\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Mm-hmm, absolutely. And certainly, those prosecutions are ongoing. I mean, hundreds have come, and there will be many more to face prison time over January 6th. But this is the government proving, again, that the argument that these were sort of hapless protesters in the street fueled by Donald Trump is not a good one. It hasn't worked for any of the other January 6 defendants. It didn't work for the Proud Boys. It isn't working for anybody. And so, even though the Proud Boys' stated goals are to fight for Trump and to fight for GOP grievances, that's not a valid excuse in front of these juries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who are the Proud Boys? And talk about Tarrio in particular, who was, what, in Baltimore at the time.\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : The Proud Boys are a far-right street gang that started in 2016 ostensibly to fight for the GOP's grievances. And during January 6th, they were there, statedly, to have civil war, to have revolution, to have their last stand for Donald Trump. And they continue today, even though their leaders are behind bars. They continue today to fight those grievances against LGBTQ people, against drag queens, against women and abortion clinics. And so, that part of the Proud Boys remains. They helped foment this atmosphere of political violence we have in this country right now.\n\nTarrio was the Proud Boys' connection to Donald Trump and his allies. I spoke to Roger Stone, one of Trump's top confidants, who told me in an interview that he had been advising the Proud Boys for years leading up to January 6th and was a good friend to Tarrio. Now, during the trial, prosecutors didn't get much into those relationships. Judge Tim Kelly said, \"You've got to stick to the point in these Proud Boys defendants.\" But that question remains on the table. Through Tarrio, how much - how close did Tarrio and the Proud Boys get close to Donald Trump's ear directly through people like Roger Stone? Tarrio is their leader and their political factor. And him going behind bars is going to be disruptive, but it's not going to end them completely.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to Carmen Hernandez, an attorney for Proud Boy Zachary Rehl, speaking outside the courthouse.\n\nCARMEN HERNANDEZ : I don't believe he committed seditious conspiracy. He's a young man who served his country, has never been charged with a crime of violence, has never been convicted of a crime of violence. But the jury has spoken, and that's our system of justice. Very disappointed in the verdict. ... I think, as a society, we turn to criminal law too often. What Mr. Trump did or didn't do is of no moment to me or Mr. Rehl, but he did - he was the one who called the rally, had everyone show up.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response, Andy Campbell?\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Well, all of these defendants absolutely had a big part in gathering resources, equipment, funding, allies to D.C. for January 6, which one of the defendants, Joseph Biggs, called \"civil war\" and \"revolution.\" They were ready for something big. And on the day, after Trump's fiery speech at the Ellipse, they led the march from there to the Capitol and were the first to breach the Capitol itself. So, certainly they have responsibility.\n\nBut Ms. Hernandez is actually right in the sense that prosecutions aren't the only aspect here that are going to tamp down our extremist crisis, because we still have Proud Boys in the street, week after week, along with neo-Nazis and other militants. They still have support from the GOP and from law enforcement and from right-wing media. And until the GOP and those other elements pull their soldiers out of the street and rebuff them, which they have not done since before January 6 or after, we are going to see this kind of thing continue. We're going to see men in makeshift body armor and weaponry outside all sorts of American civic events. And so, going forward, we're looking for an entire culture shift, not just prosecutions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about who testified in the trial, from police officers who were attacked defending the Capitol, to FBI agents, to some of the Proud Boys themselves?\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Right. There were a number of police officers who were testifying in the trial, and a police officer who was expected to testify on behalf of the Proud Boys, an officer who had a relationship prior to January 6th with Tarrio, because he was gathering information from the extremist groups amassing there. But that relationship ended up being a little too close, and so this officer pleaded the Fifth and didn't end up helping the Proud Boys at all.\n\nBut the government also secured some key testimony from other Proud Boys who pleaded guilty in lieu of cooperating with the government. One of them is Jeremy Bertino of North Carolina, who had, prior to this trial, pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy already. And he testified that the Proud Boys were ready to take the reins of that march, of that movement headed to the Capitol that day. Another Proud Boy named Matthew Greene, who testified against his own, called them \"the tip of the spear\" that day.\n\nProsecutors put together a really, really good picture of just how much preparation went into January 6th that day. And, you know, while the defense argues that the Proud Boys didn't have a direct plan to storm the Capitol on January 6th, prosecutors showed the jury that that plan, that conspiracy, could have come together the day of, on that march. They realized they were surrounded by all of these people. They realized the tools that they had in front of them. And they used that mob to push forward into the Capitol so that they could upend the election.\n\nAnd then, of course, afterward, there were mountains of evidence and testimony showing that the Proud Boys celebrated what they had done. They delayed the certification of Joe Biden as president, and they were super happy about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, the unindicted person here, that was brought up by both the defense and the prosecution, was President Trump, his famous \"Stand back and stand down\" [ sic ] comment during the debate. What does this mean for him?\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Well, certainly, I mean, it shows that the president was fueling what is now essentially a terrorist cell, in the government's eyes. And we know for a fact that after he said, \"Stand back, stand by,\" the Proud Boys began gearing up for civil war for their president. And we know that Trump and his allies and right-wing media, the Tucker Carlsons of the world, have refused to rebuff these guys at all, to the point where they still believe they have the full support of the president - or, former president and his allies out in the street. And so, this isn't going to mean anything for Trump in terms of charges being thrown his way, I don't believe, but it certainly adds an underline to the fact that Trump has celebrated and tacitly supported these extremist elements since he took office. And until his politicians around him, until the right wing rebuffs them, we are seeing these extremist elements marching today, regardless of the fact that their fellow Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are in prison.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And let me correct what I said, as you corrected me: \"Stand back and stand by,\" President Trump said.\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Right. Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Andy Campbell, what happens to the Proud Boys now?\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Right. Like I said, unfortunately, the prosecutions are not enough. The Proud Boys leaders are probably going to go to jail for decades each, and that will certainly put pressure on the organization. But these Proud Boys have always shown resiliency when their leaders go to jail. They are working on the behest of the GOP's grievances, not their organization, and not even Donald Trump anymore. They know what they have to do. They have their orders, which is to commit violence for the cause. And they're out there doing it today, every single weekend. And so, the organization isn't going away, and our extremist crisis at large isn't going anywhere. We have to tell, you know, the GOP , we have to tell law enforcement, and we have to tell right-wing media to pull these forces out of the street, or else we're going to continue to have this problem going into the next election and just going into regular American civic life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Andy Campbell, senior editor at _HuffPost, his book is We Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In a New Era of American Extremism .\n\nNext up, an update on the rape and battery trial of Donald Trump. On Thursday, lawyers on both sides rested their cases. Trump's lawyer did not call a single witness. He claims, from Ireland, where he was playing golf, that he's going to testify. That's Trump.

The case marks the first time in nearly three decades that a federal jury has convicted defendants of seditious conspiracy, the crime of conspiring to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the government of the United States. \"It's a win for the Justice Department, and it also sends a message that illegal actions against the government will not go unpunished,\" says Kristen Doerer, managing editor of Right Wing Watch. Doerer also discusses other upcoming trials for insurrectionists and how extremist groups have infiltrated military and law enforcement circles.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For the first time in nearly 30 years, a federal jury has convicted two defendants of seditious conspiracy, the crime of conspiring to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the government of the United States. Jurors in Washington, D.C., Tuesday found Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes guilty of seditious conspiracy for plotting to keep Donald Trump in power after the 2020 election, resulting in the deadly January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. Kelly Meggs, who led the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, was also convicted of seditious conspiracy. Three other insurrectionists - Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell - were found guilty of other felonies. Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the verdicts Wednesday.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND : During the trial, the government's evidence showed that almost immediately following the November 2020 election, defendant Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of the Oath Keepers, began planning to oppose by force the peaceful transfer of power. With Rhodes, defendants Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins and Thomas Caldwell communicated and planned to travel to Washington on or around January 6, 2021. On January 6, as the government's evidence showed, defendants Meggs, Harrelson and Watkins forcefully breached the U.S. Capitol wearing paramilitary gear, while defendants Rhodes and Caldwell remained outside on the Capitol ground coordinating activities.\n\nLast evening, a jury of the defendants' peers found each of them guilty of serious felony offenses. As the verdict of this case makes clear, the department will work tirelessly to hold accountable those responsible for crimes related to the attack on our democracy on January 6, 2021.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Oath Keepers verdict could give momentum to cases against other major players behind the push to keep Trump in power.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Kristen Doerer. She is managing editor of Right Wing Watch .\n\nKristen, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about the significance of these convictions for seditious conspiracy and what this means.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Thank you for having me, Amy.\n\nI mean, as you noted, this is the first time in about 30 years that we've had a guilty verdict when it comes to seditious conspiracy. It's very notable. It's a win for the Justice Department, and it also sends a message that illegal actions against the government will not go unpunished.\n\nAnd I would say there are - so, there are also a number of other Oath Keepers who are charged with seditious conspiracy who are going to trial next week, and members of the Proud Boys, another far-right extremist organization, are also being charged with seditious conspiracy, and they go to trial December 12th. This sends a message to those who have pled not guilty that they have a tough trial ahead of them and that a jury has already found similar insurrectionists guilty. And so, it will be interesting to see whether these defendants decide whether they want to cooperate with the federal government and prosecutors or whether they will continue to plead not guilty.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, tell us who Oath Keepers are, and specifically its founder, Stewart Rhodes, who was convicted.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Right. So, the Oath Keepers is a far-right extremist organization. It's an anti-government organization fashioned as a militia. It was founded in 2009 by Stewart Rhodes. And the organization is extremely conspiratorial. They believe that the federal government is out to take away Americans' freedoms and essentially enslave Americans. And they often pitch - this is often the pitch that they give recruits, and they heavily recruit from former law enforcement - current and former law enforcement and military.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And tell us more about Stewart Rhodes' background and also Kelly Meggs, who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, head of the Florida chapter of Oath Keepers.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Right. So, Stewart Rhodes is former military. He also was a big Rand Paul fan and - Ron Paul, I should say. And he is also a Yale Law graduate. And he has long been involved in this anti-government extremist movement. And he founded the organization, again, in 2009, and it was kind of in reaction to the election of President Barack Obama.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what was he saying then?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Again, this was - you know, he has a very anti-government message and this belief that the federal government is being taken over by the so-called deep state and that Americans need to - you know, they need to protect their freedoms, and their enemy is the federal government.\n\nNow, that all changed when Trump came into power. They then aligned themselves with Trump and with the Trump administration. And that's what we saw, you know, ahead of the Capitol insurrection. What we ended up seeing was that there was this alliance that they - and allegiance that they had towards Trump and just wanted to keep Trump in power.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you can talk about the encrypted message he sent to his [supporters] after Biden was elected, saying, \"We aren't getting through this without a civil war.\" And then, in his opening statement, the attorney for Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes said that he and his subordinates had never planned an attack against the government, but instead were waiting for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act. Explain also what that means.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Right. So, first thing I'll say is that Stewart Rhodes has long been obsessed with this idea of civil war. And so, shortly after - you know, in early November, he was already calling for the potential use of force to keep Trump in power, claiming that he had been illegally - claiming falsely that he had been illegally - had lost the election and was going to be illegally removed from office.\n\nAnd so, he very blatantly and out in the open, you know, in December - early in December, he ended up talking to a rally on the National Mall in which he called for bloody war should Trump not invoke the Insurrection Act. And so he was both calling for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and trying to use that as cover to justify any violent actions that the Oath Keepers would end up taking. And so, you know, he was calling for the use of the Insurrection Act from very early on, but there were also, you know, video - or, audio recordings and messages in which it was very clearly said that the Insurrection Act - calling Trump to have the Insurrection Act would be tried to be used as cover for any violent actions that the Oath Keepers ended up taking.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Earlier this year, a report revealed that more than 370 law enforcement professionals appear to be linked to the Oath Keepers. The Anti-Defamation League found the names among some 38,000 listed as members in a leaked Oath Keepers membership list. They include police chiefs and sheriffs and more than 80 people who were either running for public office or already serving as elected officials. The significance of this?\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : It's very significant. It's also not very surprising, in some sense. And this is because the Oath Keepers, they often recruit from former and current law enforcement and military. And again, they come to these recruits, and they say, you know, \"The only people who can protect us from the federal government is law enforcement and military. We need your skills.\" And that's exactly it. They also want these tactical skills that law enforcement and the military have. It's very concerning.\n\nThere is also - the Oath Keepers also have connections to an anti-government sheriff's organization that sees the sheriff as the supreme power of the land, and they don't see the federal government - they believe that the sheriffs have more power than the federal government. And so, there are a number of sheriffs who also abide by this extremist ideology. And it should be very concerning. A badge is not a shield to shield you from accountability. And so, we have to make sure that we are holding people accountable and that our law enforcement are abiding by, you know, the government and the rules that we all follow.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask -\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : And as -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Go ahead.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Yeah, go ahead. Oh, I was going to say, as far as the elected officials, there are a number of people who are members of the Oath Keepers at the state level and at the local level, and this is because oftentimes these individuals do not have as much scrutiny on them, and so they're able to hold these membership affiliations. And so, that's where we see people like Arizona state Senator Wendy Rogers and Arizona state Representative Mark Finchem claim that they are members of the Oath Keepers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about Donald Trump facing growing condemnation from even Republicans, or certain ones, for hosting the white supremacist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last week. Fuentes is a Holocaust denier, a well-known racist. He dined with the president along with rapper Kanye West, who was suspended from Twitter last month for making antisemitic comments. You noted in a tweet, Kristen, \"57 Republican lawmakers were asked if they condemn Trump's dinner with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Only 18 responded-and some failed to condemn it.\" The significance of this? I mean, nothing loses like failure. Because of the number of people that Trump endorsed in the election that failed, you see a number of Republican senators, like Romney and others, condemning President Trump for hosting this dinner. Trump has yet to apologize for this. Fuentes was at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Talk about who he is and the meaning of this. The man running for House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, interestingly, has yet to fully condemn Trump for hosting him.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Yeah. So, Nick Fuentes is a well-documented white nationalist, misogynist, Christian nationalist. He's very anti-democratic, and he has an authoritarian vision for the United States. And we can say that he's well documented because Right Wing Watch has been covering this day and day, you know, every single day, trying to make sure that it's known that Nick Fuentes is a white nationalist.\n\nAnd so, Trump having him at a dinner is very significant. It's also been reported that Trump spoke fondly of Nick Fuentes and said, \"I like this guy.\" And it's very significant that Trump has not disavowed having Nick Fuentes or, you know, apologized for having dinner with him.\n\nThe fact that - there have been a number of Republicans who have come forward and denounced it. But it's taken too long. The fact that Mike Pence took a number of days before he denounced Trump for holding this dinner is disappointing. And there's a number of Republicans who still haven't responded and denounced Trump for dining with a white nationalist. That should be concern to all of us.\n\nAnd the other thing I will say is that white nationalists are seeing this lack of denunciation, the refusal to denounce Trump or this dinner, as a tacit endorsement. And we have to be very careful. You know, there is no room, there is no excuse for white nationalism, antisemitism. And it should be - you know, it should be problematic. We should hold every elected official who has a dinner with somebody like that accountable.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Fuentes was at the riot on January 6th, though he said he didn't go inside. He wore a VIP badge to Trump's speech, addressed supporters outside the Capitol during the insurrection, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and was subpoenaed by the January 6th committee.\n\nKRISTEN DOERER : Correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Kristen Doerer, I want to thank you for being with us, managing editor of Right Wing Watch . We will continue to cover these trials.\n\nNext up, we're going to look at what the Democrats have passed and are trying to pass in the lame-duck session of Congress before losing their majority in the House. We'll speak with American Prospect editor David Dayen. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Hours after Monday's inauguration, Trump granted \"full, complete and unconditional\" presidential pardons for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6 insurrection.

The inauguration took place inside the U.S. Capitol, the same spot where Trump supporters staged an insurrection January 6th, 2021, in a violent attempt to keep him in power after he lost the 2020 race to Joe Biden. Hours after Monday's inauguration, Trump granted \"full, complete and unconditional\" presidential pardons to over 1,500 people involved in the January 6th insurrection. He also commuted the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, many of whom had been convicted of seditious conspiracy. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes had his 18-year sentence commuted. He was freed earlier today. Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio received a full pardon. He had been sentenced to 22 years in prison. Trump signed the pardons Monday night.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : So, this is January 6th, and these are the hostages, approximately 1,500, for a pardon. Full pardon.\n\nREPORTER : Full pardon or a commutation, or both?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Full pardon. We have about six commutations in there, where we're doing further research.\n\nREPORTER : OK.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : So this is a big one. Anything you want to explain about this? We hope to get them - we hope they come out tonight, frankly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The scope of Trump's pardons surprised many in Washington. Just last week, nine days ago, Trump's Vice President JD Vance told Fox News people who committed violence on January 6th shouldn't be pardoned.\n\nSEN . JD VANCE : If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. And there's a little bit of a gray area there, but we're very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law. And there are a lot of people, we think, in the wake of January the 6th who were prosecuted unfairly. We need to rectify that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined now by Jeff Sharlet, journalist, author, professor of English and creative writing at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. His latest book, The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War .\n\nJeff Sharlet, take it from the top for us. Explain what just happened yesterday, the blanket pardon of 1,500, even though you have JD Vance - in fact, Trump himself - saying that they were going to weigh these one by one.\n\nJEFF SHARLET : What it is is the worst-case scenario. And I think what you emphasized, the expansiveness of the pardon, the glee with which the pardon was issued, is striking. And I think it's easy for people to say, \"Well, he had been talking about this. We knew this was coming.\" But it's important to remember that the first lie of fascism is always its own inevitability. And we heard JD Vance wavering. And if you were following Trump on the campaign trail, there was always these nods. We now know, of course, that the nods were not to any actual belief that violence against police, that led to the death of police, was a problem. It was Trump feeling out how far he could go. And yesterday he shows he felt he can go all the way with this complete, total pardon and framing of what happened on January 6 as, in fact, a part of the sacred violence, the part of the noble myth of American history, one of his so-called liberation days.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jeff, the order begins with a roll call of heroes, calling out the leaders by name, 14 of them. Could you talk about that and what that signifies, in your view?\n\nJEFF SHARLET : I read the executive order. You see me laughing, but it's this sort of - again, how far will the fascism go? The 14 - it begins with a list of 14 names, men like Joe Biggs, Ethan Nordean, very - some of these guys on that list are very, very violent people. And these were the planners. These were the planners of a coup. These were the people who had the idea of overthrowing the United States government, or so the old conviction held.\n\nBut what's notable is that number, 14. And perhaps it's a coincidence that he chose only 14, but that is a clear echo and is being heard in white supremacist circles as an echo of the so-called 14 words. This is this kind of slogan about saving the future for white children that is kind of a motto of the far right. So, it's a little bit like Elon Musk's \" sieg heil \" salute yesterday. You can argue over whether or not it was intentional. What I can't help but notice is Elon Musk not saying it wasn't intentional. And I haven't seen any pushback from the White House to the neo-Nazis who are celebrating the 14 leaders, symbols to them of the 14 words.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Just to ask you something, before Juan asks another question, just on the \" sieg heil \" salute, and you have Nadler and others, the congressmember saying this is a clear \" sieg heil \" salute. There was a meme going around that shows him in that salute, his hand and his arm out. And it says, \"You're going to hear from people that Elon Musk did the Roman salute here. And that's true. He's done it before. But that's not exculpatory. The Roman salute was adopted by Mussolini and Italian fascists. It was then adopted by Hitler and the Nazis.\" Professor Sharlet?\n\nJEFF SHARLET : It is true. And I think, in some ways, though, this is the kind of - the trap that's being laid out for us. And I think it is - as ugly as the 14 words and this salute are, it's important for us to focus on the content, not the cosplay. The reality is: Was that number 14 intentional or not? Was that salute meant as such or not? We can argue over that. That gives them a chance to deny it and to persuade some, \"Well, this is all overstatement,\" while we're overlooking the fact of the pardon of 1,500 violent people who attacked the Capitol. You know, we had people bringing guns. We had people, explosive devices. Pardoned yesterday was a man who essentially attempted to tear a cop's head off. He had the cop's head trapped in a door, and their idea was to pull it off.\n\nNow, look at what some of these people are saying today. Again, this is the content; this isn't the cosplay. They're saying, \"First thing I'm doing now that I'm pardoned is\" - because some of them are already out of jails - \"I can get my guns back.\" One prominent January 6er who was pardoned, a reporter for the far-right website TheBlaze, said, \"Time for some ex parte communication\" with the judge in his case. They are free to do that now. And so, 14, accident or not, it's certainly being received as such. But what we can't debate is that other number, 1,500.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the significance of Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the jurisdiction that oversaw many of these cases, himself a January 6th activist?\n\nJEFF SHARLET : Yeah, Ed Martin is now put in a legal position overseeing - the position that was sort of overseeing these cases. You know, it's like the old Hair Club for Men: He's not just the president, he's a client. He was there. He gave a speech on January 5th. He talked about being there on January 6th. He was not charged with anything, but he did talk about being there. And he since became an activist, and not just an activist, a really ardent activist. In fact, he went to one of Trump's resorts to present an award to one January 6er. You might have seen the pictures of him. This is a guy who liked to style himself with a Hitler mustache and a Hitler haircut, who blamed COVID -19 on a Jewish conspiracy. Ed Martin, now this now government official, described this man as an extraordinary leader, and this is the kind of person who we want to give awards.\n\nBut again, we look at - that's the outrage. But we look at the content, not the cosplay. And we look at the structure of this executive order, combined with the executive order supposedly putting an end to weaponization of politics. You have one saying crimes that are committed on behalf of the leaders - and, you know, tasering a cop 'til he has a heart attack, this is not a gray area - are unprosecutable, and, in the other, saying we're going to go after those people who have prosecuted them. And it's expanding. Already you're seeing calls on the right for an investigation of politicians who weren't preemptively pardoned by Joe Biden, for instance, D.C. Mayor, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who they are accusing of now holding hostage those January 6ers who have not yet been released. And it's gone right into this kind of sort of white power narrative: the Black mayor of a majority-Black city holding hostage their mostly white American heroes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jeff Sharlet, we want to thank you for being with us, journalist and author, professor of English and creative writing at Dartmouth College. His latest book, The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War .\n\nWhen we come back, we look at Trump's threat to retake the Panama Canal and to declare a national emergency at the southern border. Are we going to see detention camps and military bases around the country? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "An Oath Keeper Who Helped Feds Prosecute Seditious Conspiracy Cases Is Finally Sentenced\n\nLegal/Justice Reporter, National Desk\n\nAfter cooperating with prosecutors for over two years and admitting to his role in the seditious conspiracy to stop the transfer of power on Jan. 6, 2021, Brian Ulrich, a former Georgia member of the Oath Keeper extremist group, was sentenced to 36 months, or three years, of probation on Tuesday, in line with a considerably lenient request from the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors had asked that Ulrich spend three years on supervised probation, do 120 hours of community service and pay $2,000 in restitution to go toward the nearly $3 million in damages done to the Capitol. Ulrich was mostly unopposed to those terms and told the court he has had no contact with Oath Keepers since he was released on a $25,000 bond in August 2021.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta agreed to impose the $2,000 restitution order during Tuesday's hearing.\n\nUlrich could have faced up to 20 years for his charges if he hadn't cooperated with prosecutors.\n\nOn Jan. 6 and in the weeks leading up to it, Ulrich was under the direction of Elmer Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, who was hellbent on opposing the transfer of power to then President-elect Joe Biden from Donald Trump.\n\nRhodes called on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and on Oath Keepers to stop Biden, whom he called a \"Chinese communist,\" from entering the White House. Rhodes publicly and prominently believed the election had been stolen due to widespread voter fraud, and he often spoke of a coming civil war that would be required to stop Biden from taking power.\n\nUlrich admitted he was one of Rhodes' foot soldiers who rallied under that banner.\n\n\"And if there's a civil war, then there's a civil war,\" Ulrich wrote in one December 2020 message to fellow Oath Keepers just ahead of the insurrection.\n\nIn April 2022, Ulrich struck a plea deal and admitted to felony charges of seditious conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding. He was only the second Oath Keeper to break ranks. Joshua James, an Alabama Oath Keeper chapter leader who served as GOP operative Roger Stone's security detail on Jan. 5, was the first to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy.\n\nUlrich admitted that he had a knife and was intent on stopping the certification when he went to the Capitol with Rhodes and other members of the group. He wept when he entered his guilty plea before Mehta in 2022.\n\nAs part of his plea deal, the Georgia man admitted that he used the encrypted messaging app Signal to talk to Oath Keepers; evidence confirmed that Rhodes put him in a text group known as \"DC OP: Jan 6 21.\" Members used the group to discuss how they planned to get to Washington and how they would transport tactical gear or weapons.\n\nIn one message sent in December 2020, Ulrich told members that he was planning on carrying two backpacks at the Capitol: one for his personal belongings and the other with an \"ammo load out with some basics I can switch to if shit truly [hits] the fan blades ... I will be the guy running around with the budget AR.\"\n\nUltimately, after a conversation with another Oath Keeper about the \"ammo load out,\" he decided not to bring any firearms or ammunition into Washington personally.\n\nBut he testified that his co-conspirators did indeed haul huge numbers of guns and ammunition for their \"quick reaction force,\" or QRF, at a hotel in northern Virginia. There, Oath Keepers stashed dozens of boxes and bags packed to the brim with weapons and ammunition. They carried firearms in dollies and carts draped with blankets so as not to alarm hotel staff.\n\nUlrich admitted that he, James and other Oath Keepers had traveled around the D.C. metropolitan area in two vehicles on Jan. 4 as well. Ulrich also confirmed that James was in one of those cars separate from himself, and it was James' car that contained multiple guns meant for the QRF, including semi-automatic handguns and shotguns.\n\nUlrich arrived at the Capitol on Jan. 6 after hearing news reports about rioters overtaking police. That morning, he was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington with James and others. They decided to leave on golf carts; sporting protective vests and goggles, Ulrich and his fellow Oath Keepers zipped through the streets and past police barricades, at times with another Oath Keeper, Roberto Minuta, filming them.\n\nUlrich never said that he had been part of conversations that involved an explicit plan to stop the transfer of power. But he admitted that it was implied.\n\nWhen the Oath Keepers finally arrived at the steps of the Capitol, they clasped hands on each other's backs to form a \"stack\" formation that would let them barrel through the crowd, Ulrich testified. It was understood that this was a moment of \"coming together for us to do something,\" he said.\n\nThat \"something\" was \"to stop the vote count,\" court transcripts of his testimony show.\n\nWhen Ulrich breached the Capitol building, he wasn't inside for long, nor was he violent. He did not assault police and did not go further than the lobby. Police cleared him out shortly after he entered. Ulrich then went to find Rhodes and met with him and other Oath Keepers who were gathered outside of the Capitol.\n\nProsecutors said that Ulrich, who had no criminal history prior to the insurrection, showed \"tremendous acceptance of responsibility\" when he agreed to cooperate and gave the U.S. government \"substantial assistance\" in its prosecution of the most serious cases to emerge from the probe into Jan. 6.\n\nIn a sentencing memorandum, Ulrich's attorneys noted that Ulrich had admitted to making a \"series of bad choices that led him to this legal reckoning\" and that much of what he did in the beginning when chatting with Oath Keepers was simply about \"fanning the flames of discord and violence regarding the transfer of presidential power to Joseph R. Biden.\"\n\nNonetheless, he admitted he still came to Washington, purchased two-way radios and tactical gear, and was intent on stopping the certification.\n\n\"Mr. Ulrich has refused multiple interview requests and has strictly avoided making any public comments about the charges against him. He is embarrassed at what his actions have caused his country, his family and his person,\" lawyer A.J. Balbo wrote in a Nov. 8 sentencing memorandum.\n\nTo date, seditious conspiracy is the most serious charge to emerge from the Justice Department's Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nOath Keepers were charged in batches because a single courtroom could not accommodate all of the defendants and their lawyers.\n\nRhodes is currently serving an 18-year prison sentence for his role in the seditious conspiracy. His second in command, Kelly Meggs, is serving 12 years after a jury found him guilty of seditious conspiracy as well. Three others charged alongside Rhodes and Kelly were acquitted of that most serious charge: Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell. Watkins was sentenced to 8 1/2 years; Harrelson received four years. Caldwell has yet to be sentenced; he was supposed to be on Monday, but that hearing was punted to Dec. 20 following an order from Mehta.\n\nA second batch of Oath Keepers, including Minuta, David Moerschel, Edward Vallejo and Joseph Hackett, were found guilty of seditious conspiracy as well. Minuta received 4 1/2 years; Vallejo and Moerschel received three years; and Hackett received 3 1/2 years.\n\nMembers of the extremist Proud Boys were also convicted of seditious conspiracy, including leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio. Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison, the longest to date of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's cohort and former Infowars contributor, Joe Biggs, was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 17 years. Two other Proud Boys also received lengthy sentences for seditious conspiracy, including Zachary Rehl and Ethan Nordean, both of whom received 15 and 18 years, respectively.\n\nSeveral of the Proud Boys have already indicated they will seek pardons from Trump once he takes office. Norm Pattis, a lawyer for Biggs, told The New York Times last week that he sent a letter to Trump seeking clemency and argued that a blanket pardon for Jan. 6 rioters would inspire unity across the nation.\n\nRequests for pardons have been steadily creeping into more Jan. 6 cases since the election earlier this month. Politico reported on Tuesday that during a hearing for a Jan. 6 defendant, a federal judge expressed that it would be \"beyond frustrating and disappointing\" if Trump grants blanket pardons or \"anything close\" to it.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Seditious Oath Keeper Who'd Been Tapped As Roger Stone's Security Guard Gets Probation\n\nLegal/Justice Reporter, National Desk\n\nJoshua James, a former Oath Keeper chapter leader and Army veteran from Alabama who pleaded guilty to engaging in a seditious conspiracy to stop the transfer of power on Jan. 6, 2021, was sentenced to three years of probation on Friday.\n\nThe lenient sentence was thanks to James' early cooperation with the Justice Department.\n\nInitially indicted alongside Oath Keeper leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes and several other members of the far-right group charged with seditious conspiracy, the Arab, Alabama, man broke ranks in March 2022. James pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and to a single charge of obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\nAs part of that plea deal, prosecutors agreed to dismiss other charges James faced, including a document-tampering charge. The bargain that James struck drastically reduced the number of years he could have faced if he went to trial and was convicted of sedition.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge alone carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison. (Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years.)\n\nWhen James first pleaded guilty, prosecutors told a federal judge they would seek a sentence of nine years, but in the time since that deal was struck, prosecutors departed significantly. In a memorandum submitted to the court ahead of sentencing, prosecutors told presiding U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta just 24 months, or two years of incarceration, three years of supervised release and a fine of $2,000 were acceptable. Mehta departed from that on Friday, agreeing that he should be given only the probation.\n\nJames admitted key information to prosecutors that helped convict nearly a dozen members of the extremist group on numerous charges. He disclosed that the Oath Keepers had plotted to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory from as early as November 2020, when he, Rhodes and others met at Oath Keeper associate and Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell's farm in Virginia to hash out their strategy.\n\nDuring the Oath Keepers' seditious conspiracy trial in 2022, Caldwell insisted he was never part of the network and often grew emotional or combative on the witness stand as he denied his involvement with the group as well as any suggestion that he deleted incriminating texts or communications with other members. Ultimately, Caldwell was acquitted of the seditious conspiracy charge, though he was convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding and tampering with documents. When the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the interpretation of the obstruction charge in Fischer v. United States earlier this year, Caldwell's obstruction charge was dropped. Now 69 years old, Caldwell has been awaiting sentencing for over a year. He was supposed to be sentenced on Friday, but prosecutors on Thursday requested a delay.\n\nAs for James, he admitted that during regular discussions with the group, including discussions Caldwell was privy to, there was never a question about whether the Oath Keepers were willing to use any means necessary to stop the transfer of power, including \"lethal force.\"\n\nJames admitted the Oath Keepers were willing to use lethal force against anyone who tried to remove Donald Trump from the White House, and that included the National Guard.\n\nJames also disclosed in his plea deal how Rhodes and fellow Oath Keepers gathered and transported a staggering number of guns, ammunition and tactical gear to a hotel in northern Virginia. It was meant to be the group's \"quick reaction force\" ― whether Trump invoked the Insurrection Act or if Rhodes alone ordered them to spring into action.\n\nAhead of Jan. 6, 2021, James was one of several Oath Keepers who kept contact with Roger Stone , a longtime friend and adviser to Trump, including while the GOP operative was in Washington on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6.\n\nOath Keepers escorted Stone to a rally on Jan. 5 in Washington, serving as his security force.\n\nWhen the rioting at the U.S. Capitol erupted on Jan. 6, Stone was at the Willard Hotel in Washington with James and other Oath Keepers. James quickly left Stone and took off in a golf cart driven by another Oath Keeper, Roberto Minuta. Rhodes had told them for weeks up to that point that if they were called upon, they were to immediately drop what they were doing and head to the White House to secure a perimeter for Trump.\n\nMinuta and James sped past and through police barricades as they headed toward the Capitol. In a live-streamed video during the golf-cart ride that was entered into evidence at Minuta's seditious conspiracy trial, Minuta could be heard saying they were going to the Capitol because they had received word that people had breached the building.\n\nJames was part of a group of Oath Keepers who marched up the Capitol steps in a stack formation before breaking into the building. Video footage showed James leading Minuta farther into the Capitol where the men would assault and taunt police. Footage from a body-worn camera on a D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officer, prosecutors said, showed James yelling at officers and pushing them violently. At one point, the officer is heard telling James to leave while he pants and says he cannot breathe.\n\nAfter the Capitol attack, James stayed in contact with Rhodes and followed Rhodes' instructions to delete encrypted texts shared among members of the group. James directly told other Oath Keepers to delete communications, too, and remove messages from their chats that included photos that might show their faces.\n\nJames stayed with Rhodes in Texas for a few weeks after Jan. 6. He was Rhodes' security guard. Rhodes gave James a burner phone and told him to use a fake identity when he used the phone. In the weeks before the inauguration, James accompanied Rhodes on numerous trips where Rhodes purchased more firearms, ammunition, scopes, holsters and tactical equipment.\n\nJames told Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs - also later convicted of seditious conspiracy - to \"stay below the radar\" as they awaited instructions for their next steps. James finally left Rhodes in Texas in early February. Biden had been inaugurated and Rhodes feared arrest, prosecutors wrote in James' sentencing memorandum this month.\n\nRhodes told James to be ready for \"civil war\" and sent him back home to Alabama. Rhodes asked him to store their gear in a shed once he got there and await further instruction.\n\nJames agreed.\n\nAccording to Politico , James offered a tearful apology at his sentencing on Friday.\n\nMore than 1,500 people have been prosecuted in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, but those charged and convicted of seditious conspiracy are in an elite group of defendants. It was the most serious charge to emerge.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has indicated he will pardon Jan. 6 rioters when he takes office in January. It is unclear if those who plotted to stop the transfer of power after the 2020 election will be included.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that James was sentenced to two years of incarceration.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Proud Boys Leaders Found Guilty Of Jan. 6 Seditious Conspiracy\n\nSenior Editor, HuffPost\n\nMultiple leaders of the Proud Boys street gang were found guilty of seditious conspiracy and other charges on Thursday over the outsize role they played in the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAfter almost a week of deliberation, a jury in Washington, D.C., returned a partial verdict finding Proud Boys Enrique Tarrio - the gang's chairman - Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl guilty of seditious conspiracy, a rare charge historically brought against terrorists on American soil. A fifth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, was found innocent of seditious conspiracy after further deliberation.\n\nThe jury was initially deadlocked on the seditious conspiracy charge for Pezzola, along with various other charges lodged against each Proud Boy, including destruction of government property and assaulting law enforcement. Later Thursday, District Court Judge Tim Kelly declared a mistrial on the deadlocked charges, leaving it up to prosecutors to decide whether to retry them later.\n\nAll five were convicted of obstruction charges and conspiracy related to delaying Congress on Jan. 6. Pezzola - the first to breach a Capitol window using a riot shield stolen from an officer - was the sole Proud Boy found guilty of robbery and assaulting an officer.\n\nThe trial, which lasted nearly four months, was one of the government's highest-profile cases against leaders of two extremist groups that flooded D.C. in late 2020 to make their final stand for then-President Donald Trump . Several leaders of the Oath Keepers - a self-described militia - were found guilty on seditious conspiracy charges in January .\n\nTo prove seditious conspiracy against the Proud Boys, prosecutors had to convince the jury that not only did the gang lead a mob to breach the Capitol on Jan. 6, but that they agreed to do so beforehand in an effort to overturn the election. Though several Proud Boys argued in court that they didn't have a plan to storm the Capitol in the months leading up to Jan. 6, the government built a case suggesting that the conspiracy could have come together at any time - including the day of, as the gang led a march from Trump's inciting \"fight like hell\" speech at the Ellipse toward the Capitol steps. Then, prosecutors argued, the Proud Boys used the throng of Trump supporters amassing around them as \"tools\" to breach the Capitol and ultimately delay the certification of Joe Biden as president.\n\nMessages shown in court between Biggs and Tarrio detailed their desire to recruit more dangerous allies before Jan. 6 - which several defendants referred to as a coming \"civil war\" - as opposed to the rest of the Proud Boys' rank and file, whom Biggs referred to as \"losers who wanna drink.\"\n\n\"Let's get radical and get real men,\" Biggs messaged Tarrio on Dec. 19, 2020.\n\nThat quote played a key role in the prosecution's case.\n\n\"The Oath Keepers had their rifles. The Proud Boys had their 'real men,'\" prosecutor Conor Mulroe said previously at trial .\n\nThe government often drew a hard line between Trump's rhetoric and the Proud Boys' mobilization to D.C., including an infamous moment during the 2020 presidential debates in which Trump, asked to rebuff any of the American extremist factions fighting on his behalf, said, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"\n\nRegardless of Trump's intent in that moment, the gang took his words as marching orders and began stockpiling cash, equipment and recruits to prepare for Jan. 6.\n\nSeveral of the defendants' lawyers attempted to use Trump's rhetoric as a blanket excuse for the Proud Boys' mobilization.\n\n\"You see Trump, President Trump, told them the election was stolen,\" Tarrio's attorney, Sabino Jauregui, said at trial . \"It was Trump that told them to go [to the Capitol]. And it was Trump that unleashed them on January 6. He's the one that told them to march over there and 'fight like hell.'\"\n\nBut prosecutors fired back with mountains of evidence - including video, social media posts and witness testimony - showing the gang was trained, prepared and in agreement to commit violence in an attempt to stop the certification.\n\nThe government also secured guilty pleas from multiple Proud Boys in exchange for key testimony. Among them was Jeremy Bertino, a chapter leader from North Carolina, who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy prior to trial. He testified in February that he and his fellow Proud Boys were prepared to forcibly overturn the election if nobody else could.\n\n\"It was common knowledge that if everything else failed, there was no other option than to go into a civil war, a revolution,\" he said in court . \"This was a common topic of conversation in all of the chats I was in.\"\n\nWhile prosecutors put together a strong case against these five defendants, several questions about the Proud Boys' role in the events of Jan. 6 remain unanswered.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Stone was not only in contact with Tarrio on the day of Jan. 6, he previously admitted that he was a friend and adviser to the gang's leadership, and coached them through their political - and sometimes criminal - goals . If looking into the Proud Boys' multi-pronged connections was ever an option for prosecutors, Judge Tim Kelly was adamant from the beginning that they not stray far from the defendants in front of them.\n\nIt's also unclear what chilling effect, if any, the trial will have on the national Proud Boys organization or the growing extremist crisis under the Republican Party . The gang continues to mobilize throughout the country, primarily in response to the GOP's grievances: Over the past year they've held near-weekly rallies at LGBTQ+ events, abortion clinics and demonstrations, and drag queen story hours , introducing violence, harassment, and members of other bigoted factions to otherwise peaceful civic events.\n\nThat said, the Proud Boys are facing legal pressure from a variety of sources. Several of their leaders are looking at decades of prison time over the verdict, and separately, some of the defendants and the national organization are being sued for $22 million after the Proud Boys vandalized a number of historic, Black D.C. churches in the month leading up to Jan. 6.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Proud Boys Sedition Trial And The Violence At The GOP's Core\n\nSenior Editor, HuffPost\n\nThe Proud Boys' seditious conspiracy trial opens Monday in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where five top members of the violent far-right group stand accused of a leading role in the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe high-stakes trial, which is expected to take at least six weeks to complete, will cover the breadth of the Justice Department's investigation into the fascist street gang and its alleged plot to upend the 2020 election. Those facing charges include Enrique Tarrio, the gang's longtime chairman, and four other leaders accused of coordinating and participating in the attack: Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola.\n\nBut the implications of this case extend beyond the fate of five extremist leaders and their actions surrounding Jan. 6. It will measure the federal government's overall response to the Proud Boys - whose six-year parade of violence and bigoted harassment continues today - and the broader extremist threat they represent.\n\nThe relationships they've secured in law enforcement , right-wing media and the upper crust of the GOP have landed them in a comfortable and supported place in American politics. Their ongoing efforts have served to normalize violence as a justified option in right-wing political campaigns.\n\nIn essence, this is as much a case about the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as it is about the crises of political violence and extremism at large.\n\n\"The continued efforts of Proud Boys after Jan. 6 to create chaos and incite violence locally and nationally is indicative of the risk the group continues to pose to the safety of communities and individuals across the country,\" said Dr. Cassie Miller, senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a statement released over the weekend .\n\nShe continued: \"It is of the utmost importance that the Proud Boys, and all those who helped plan and perpetrate the attack on Jan. 6, be held accountable. Without such accountability, our democracy will continue to be at risk.\"\n\nThe DOJ has already built an expansive case against the group, with evidence that includes their communications via text and social media, and hours of video showing their movements on Jan. 6.\n\nBut there could be some new, bombshell revelations once Proud Boys members take the stand in January. The DOJ has secured plea deals from several top Proud Boys, whose testimony could shed new light on the gang's ties to the GOP - and, more specifically, Donald Trump 's inner circle - in the lead-up to the insurrection.\n\nThere's no question that the Proud Boys played an outsize role in the attack on Jan. 6. More than 100 members and their allies marched alongside thousands of Trump supporters toward the Capitol that day. Several Proud Boys led the initial charge , identified and breached key defensive barriers set up by law enforcement, clashed with officers, and encouraged others to join them in storming the Capitol.\n\nTwo Proud Boys insiders - Charles Donohoe of North Carolina and Jeremy Bertino of South Carolina - have already pleaded guilty to conspiracy and seditious conspiracy , respectively, and have agreed to cooperate with the government in its case against their fellow members.\n\nThose pleas significantly strengthen the basic allegations in the DOJ's case: The Proud Boys, fueled by the notion that Jan. 6, 2021, would be their last chance to overturn the election in favor of Trump, mobilized members from across the country to Washington in December 2020 and conspired to violently disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden as president.\n\nDonohoe and Bertino were among several top members who were invited by Tarrio to a series of encrypted chatrooms for planning purposes - one of which was titled \"Ministry of Self-Defense\" - and it was through these communications that leaders repeatedly implicated themselves in the attack.\n\n\"You know we made this happen,\" and \"1776 motherfucker,\" Bertino messaged to Tarrio following the insurrection on Jan. 6, court documents show .\n\nThough Tarrio was not present during the riot itself, the DOJ will seek to show that he played a key role in organizing the Proud Boys' violent campaign, alongside leaders of the Oath Keepers extremist group, two of whom were found guilty in November following their own seditious conspiracy trial. On top of setting up the encrypted chatrooms, Tarrio also allegedly looked over a planning document titled \"1776 Returns\" in December of 2020, which detailed a plot to occupy several buildings in D.C. on Jan. 6. He also met with Oath Keepers leadership on the eve of Jan. 6 , and separately, has already seen jail time over his role in a violent, pro-Trump Proud Boys march through D.C. on Dec. 12, 2020.\n\nThe DOJ contends that Tarrio's four co-defendants played equally significant but varied roles in planning and carrying out the insurrection:\n\nPezzola was among the first to breach the Capitol. He was captured on video using a police riot shield - which he allegedly ripped away from a responding officer - to smash a window, through which a swarm of Trump supporters entered the Capitol and began their search for members of Congress inside.\n\nNordean, Biggs and Rehl were reportedly given leadership roles in coordinating the Proud Boys' campaign. Among other allegations , they worked to obfuscate the gang's involvement that day by ordering members not to wear the gang's colors, black and yellow. As the attack unfolded, they allegedly branched out among the throng, agitating other insurrectionists and encouraging the assault on the Capitol.\n\nThe Proud Boys' defense centers around Tarrio's relationship with Metropolitan Police Lt. Shane Lamond, an intelligence officer who was tasked with monitoring the Proud Boys and other factions as they gathered in Washington. Lamond was in close contact with Tarrio prior to the riots, and defense lawyers argue that the pair discussed the \"purpose of the [Proud Boys'] trip, the agenda, and the location,\" according to the Associated Press . They argued that Tarrio's stated plans for the Proud Boys involved peaceful protest, not violence.\n\n\"How can there be sedition if the Proud Boys are informing law enforcement of their plans on Jan. 6?\" Tarrio attorney Sabino Jauregui said prior to trial .\n\nBut prosecutors revealed that they'd been investigating that relationship for months, and that Lamond could himself face charges. Lamond now plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if he's called to the stand, which hamstrings the Proud Boys' defense, according to The New York Times .\n\nAlongside their own sedition case, the Proud Boys are also a key figure in the federal and congressional overarching investigations into Trump and his cohort's connection to the attack.\n\nTarrio maintains a close relationship with Trump ally Roger Stone, who admitted in an interview with this reporter that he'd been advising Tarrio and the Proud Boys through their political ambitions for years.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed that the pair was in contact leading up to and on Jan. 6, as well: Tarrio was among dozens in a group chat with Stone that's existed since 2019 , titled \"Friends of Stone.\" Others included Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, and allies of conspiratorial talk show host Alex Jones and Mike Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\n\nThere are still questions about what Trump knew about the attack and when, and how close extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were to direct contact with the former president on or before Jan. 6. Stone is currently the Proud Boys' closest known ally to the White House, and the expected testimony from Bertino and Donohoe could reveal more about that relationship, and further implicate Trump's right-hand man.\n\nThe sedition trial will also help determine what chilling effect, if any, the government's sweeping Jan. 6 investigation will have on far-right extremism in America, and the increasingly violent anti-Democratic rhetoric coming from the pro-Trump right in recent months.\n\nDespite their leaders in prison awaiting trial, the Proud Boys and other extremist groups have continued to mobilize on the grievances of the GOP and right-wing media. Throughout 2022, they've brought violence and harassment to Roe v. Wade demonstrations, events featuring drag queens, abortion clinics and children's hospitals that feature trans health care programs. Many of these events feature violence at the hands of Proud Boys, who often come armed and alongside other violent factions, including neo-Nazi groups, according to a Vice News investigation .\n\nMeanwhile, GOP leadership has yet to issue a full-throated condemnation of the Proud Boys' dirty work, or that of their allies. In fact, Republicans have embraced the same brand of political violence as a platform for the party's future.\n\nRepublican leaders joined white nationalists at an annual gala put on by the New York Young Republican Club earlier this month in Manhattan, where they declared \"total war\" on the left, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .\n\n\"We want to cross the Rubicon. We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets,\" NYYRC President Gavin Wax said onstage.\n\nAt the same event, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) was met with applause when she declared that the insurrection would have been a successful operation had she led it.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Oath Keepers Founder Sentenced For Seditious Conspiracy Over Jan. 6 Capitol Riot\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nOath Keepers founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years behind bars Thursday, six months after being convicted of seditious conspiracy in federal court for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta delivered a searing and lengthy reproach to Rhodes shortly before handing down his sentence, telling him, \"You, sir, present an ongoing threat and a peril to this country and to the republic and to the very fabric of this democracy,\" according to NBC News .\n\nEarlier, Rhodes recited a 20-minute-long diatribe to the courtroom in which he called himself a \"political prisoner\" and said his only crime was trying to stop politicians from \"destroying\" America.\n\nMehta responded to his claims directly: \"You are not a political prisoner, Mr. Rhodes.\"\n\nThe judge said it was clear that Rhodes wanted \"democracy in this country to devolve into violence.\" He also expressed concern that another incident like Jan. 6 could be on the horizon, saying Americans \"hold our collective breaths every time an election is approaching,\" The Associated Press reported .\n\n\"The moment you are released, whenever that may be, you will be ready to take up arms against your government,\" Mehta said, per the AP.\n\nAlthough prosecutors had sought a 25-year term for the 58-year-old, his sentence is still the longest of any Capitol riot defendant so far. More than 1,000 people have been charged in connection to the insurrection.\n\nAnother leader in the far-right anti-government group, Kelly Meggs, was sentenced to 12 years behind bars on similar charges later Thursday.\n\nThe Oath Keepers' trial last fall was a watershed moment in the federal government's massive effort to prosecute the mob that had stormed the Capitol and terrorized the police and lawmakers inside in the name of former President Donald Trump .\n\nDue to the large number of defendants ― nine ― they were split into two groups for trial; jurors convicted six of them on seditious conspiracy charges. Rhodes and Meggs are the first to face sentencing.\n\nAs the ringleader of the Oath Keepers, Rhodes was accused of preparing for a potentially large-scale gunfight at the Capitol on Jan. 6, having stockpiled a cache of high-powered weapons at a hotel just outside Washington.\n\nThe nation's capital has strict gun control laws, but prosecutors said the Oath Keepers wanted to have firearms nearby just in case Trump signaled that he wanted them to use force to overturn President Joe Biden 's victory. Rhodes believed that Trump could achieve his goal by invoking the Insurrection Act, which gives a president the authority to send in the military to \"suppress insurrection.\"\n\nWhile Rhodes did not enter the Capitol himself, prosecuting attorneys said at trial that he had primed his followers to engage in conflict at the Capitol, observing the chaos from a hill like a \"battlefield general.\"\n\nMeggs entered the Capitol leading what prosecutors called a \"stack\" formation of other Oath Keepers clad in military-style tactical gear.\n\nScores of text messages displayed in court, along with audio recordings, helped to paint a picture of the planning that had gone into the Oath Keepers' decision to show up on Jan. 6, the day Congress was officially certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nOne recording revealed how Rhodes told an acquaintance just a few days after the riot that he regretted not bringing rifles to Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I'd hang fuckin' Pelosi from the lamppost,\" Rhodes was heard saying in the audio.\n\nRhodes defended himself in part by saying he was bloviating when he used strong language. He also argued that he and his Oath Keepers were actually just trying to help law enforcement, despite not being asked to do so. Prosecutors said the Oath Keepers as a group have a history of providing unasked-for \"security.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Prosecutors Say D.C. Cop Was 'Double Agent' For Seditious Proud Boys Ahead of Jan. 6\n\nLegal/Justice Reporter, National Desk\n\nWASHINGTON - On the first day of his criminal trial, prosecutors told a federal judge that former D.C. Metropolitan Police Lieutenant Shane Lamond, who exchanged hundreds of text messages with Proud Boys leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, essentially worked as a \"double agent\" for the extremist group before Jan. 6 and when pressed about that contact, lied to investigators.\n\nLamond, 48, was first indicted in 2023 on four counts including felony obstruction of justice as well as making false statements. His case is not about the attack on the Capitol. Rather, Lamond's charges involve his alleged sharing of insider information about a police probe into the Proud Boys and the destruction of a Black Lives Matter banner stolen from a historic Black church on Dec. 12, 2020.\n\nTarrio repeatedly took credit for the destruction of the banner online, once writing on the social media site Parler that he was \"damn proud I did it.\" He even briefly changed his Parler handle to \"Fiery Tarrio.\"\n\nTarrio was arrested on Jan. 4, 2021, for the banner burning charge and formally ordered out of Washington, D.C., within 24 hours. He pleaded guilty to destroying the banner as well as to a charge of possessing two high-capacity magazines found on him during his arrest. When Tarrio was on trial with fellow Proud Boys for seditious conspiracy and a number of other Jan. 6-related charges last year, federal prosecutors said Tarrio used his Jan. 4 arrest as a neatly timed alibi for his whereabouts on Jan. 6. (Tarrio was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, but watching from a hotel room in Maryland and texting with fellow Proud Boys. He is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence.)\n\nProsecutors say Lamond told Tarrio about the probe into the banner roughly a week after it happened and disclosed that police were weighing whether it should be charged as a hate crime. Lamond even went so far as to tell Tarrio he would check to see if MPD criminal investigators had footage of Tarrio burning the banner, prosecutors said. In another text message that emerged at the Proud Boys seditious conspiracy trial, Lamond allegedly warned Tarrio that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service were \"all spun up\" after Tarrio went on the now-defunct InfoWars site and stated that Proud Boys would show up at public events pretending to be supporters of President Joe Biden.\n\nLamond, who has pleaded not guilty, insists he has no sympathies for the Proud Boys, but that while working as a leader for MPD's intelligence division, his communications with Tarrio were a necessary part of his job monitoring and developing sources.\n\nDefense lawyer Mark Schamel claims Lamond's closeness to Tarrio - the men shared at least 500 text messages, called each other \"brother\" on occasion and even went out for drinks - was an effort to keep tabs on the Proud Boys movements overall and to help prevent skirmishes between Proud Boys and other groups who might have shown up for rallies or other public events in D.C. at the same time.\n\nBut on Monday, U.S. Attorney Joshua Rothstein told U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson that isn't quite what the record suggests.\n\nRothstein argued that Lamond - on the force for nearly 25 years when he was charged - used encrypted text channels with Tarrio to give him a \"play-by-play\" of police activity.\n\nBefore Christmas 2020, prosecutors said, Lamond was shown a photo of Tarrio with other Proud Boys and asked if he could identify him. Within days, according to prosecutors, texts showed Lamond telling Tarrio about being asked to ID him. Yet more records allegedly show Lamond then warning Tarrio he would likely soon be arrested for the banner burning.\n\nMPD Lieutenant Ahsan Mufti, the government's first witness in the trial, testified Monday that when a picture of Tarrio and fellow Proud Boys began circulating among investigators in December, Lamond told police that he had seen Tarrio before, but only \"five or six times.\"\n\nMufti, specifically tasked with getting Tarrio's arrest warrant approved, said he thought that was the limit of their contact, and that Lamond had never disclosed that they had also shared hundreds of texts and calls. If he had known about that communication in December 2020, it could have made the case for Tarrio's warrant stronger, Mufti said.\n\nLamond did, however, provide Mufti with Tarrio's phone number and helped to positively ID Tarrio's voice on a podcast. This was helpful in getting the warrant, Mufti conceded.\n\nNonetheless, Rothstein said, evidence at trial will show that Lamond's leaking of sensitive police information was a steady drip and tied into his own affinity for the extremist group's ideology.\n\nLamond's attorneys argue prosecutors are cherry-picking his texts to make the case that their client was committing a crime when he was just trying to maximize his contact with Tarrio to gather intel about the Proud Boys.\n\nDuring the Proud Boys' seditious conspiracy trial, FBI agent Peter Dubrowski, who reviewed the texts between Lamond and Tarrio, testified that the messages did not strike him as chats typical or normal in a police-confidential source relationship. Dubrowski said it was abnormal that Lamond, for example, told Tarrio when and where Proud Boys were being locked up.\n\nIn one text just 24 hours before the \"Black Lives Matter\" banner was burned, Lamond wrote to Tario: \"Copy. Antifa should be staying up at BLM Plaza. Do you want me to let our uniformed officers know that or keep it to myself? I'll be around all night in case anything kicks off.\"\n\nProsecutors asked Dubrowski last year if it was \"typical for an officer to defer to a source\" as Tarrio and his codefendants looked on.\n\n\" No ,\" Dubrowski said in February 2023.\n\nMore evidence of that allegedly atypical relationship was spelled out in Lamond's indictment. In a text to Tarrio, Lamond fawned: \"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see the group's name and reputation dragged through the mud.\"\n\nThe false statement charges are specific to Lamond's conduct in June 2021. During an interview with investigators, prosecutors say Lamond initially described his contact with Tarrio as \"one-sided\" and he denied ever telling Tarrio about the imminent arrest warrant for the flag burning.\n\nWhen Tarrio was on trial, he wished to call Lamond to testify on his behalf. Tarrio argued the police lieutenant's testimony would prove to jurors that their relationship was never untoward and that he wouldn't have risked a close relationship with Lamond if he was planning to attack the Capitol.\n\nBut Lamond never testified for Tarrio, opting not to get involved and potentially incriminate himself while a probe into his own conduct was ongoing.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Biggest Players of Jan. 6 Walk Free Thanks To Trump\n\nLegal/Justice Reporter, National Desk\n\nIt is a victorious day for the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.\n\nSome 14 members of the right-wing extremist groups who faced the most serious charge to emerge from the events of Jan. 6, 2021 - seditious conspiracy - including former Oath Keepers leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes and former Proud Boys leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio - will now walk free because President Donald Trump commuted their sentences or pardoned them Monday.\n\nTarrio and Rhodes were released from prison Tuesday morning.\n\nThe commutations were part of a sweeping executive order the president signed hours after taking office, in which he also granted a full pardon to the more than 1,500 people who have been charged with crimes connected to the attack on the U.S. Capitol - including those convicted of assaulting law enforcement officers.\n\nA pardon removes the record of a conviction, while a commutation reduces a person's sentence but does not remove their conviction record. Individuals who saw their sentences commuted by Trump will not have all of their civil rights restored, including rights to own a firearm or vote.\n\nRhodes was sentenced to 18 years in May 2023 after a jury found him guilty of conspiring to stop the transfer of power and other charges. In September 2023, Tarrio, who asked Trump for a full pardon on the fourth anniversary of the insurrection, was sentenced to 22 years .\n\nTarrio was not among the people on Trump's list of commutations. However, the executive order states it grants \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021\" - meaning he has been pardoned. Trump's clemency list specifically commuted Proud Boy Jeremy Bertino. Bertino pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and admitted on the stand that when Proud Boys were storming the Capitol, he was in a back channel urging those on the ground to \"form a spear\" and \"drive your way through a crowd if you need to.\"\n\nBut Bertino hadn't yet been sentenced.\n\nMost of the people who stormed the Capitol were not members of the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys or other extremist groups. But there was a sprawling constellation of far-right groups and affiliates who descended on the Capitol that day, including Three-Percenters, members of the QAnon conspiracy movement and state militia groups, according to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. As prosecutors proved to jurors at trial, however, the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys were instrumental in coordinating and executing the attack as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 election.\n\nMichael Bloch is a New York litigator with experience handling cases involving white supremacists and extremist ideology - he represented civil rights groups and activists when they sued organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and neo-Nazi groups like Identity Evropa and Vanguard America. He told HuffPost earlier this month that there was \"no question\" a sweeping pardon of Jan. 6 defendants would embolden extremists throughout America \"in the same way that white supremacists have been emboldened by Trump and his supportive rhetoric for the last eight years.\"\n\n\"The pardon power is intended to be an exercise in mercy and used appropriately,\" Bloch said. \"It really is an important power that frankly should be used more often. I think what's different about this case is twofold: First, for Trump to exercise blanket pardon power for Jan. 6 defendants, [he] would be doing it to reward those who are loyal to him, and [second], he's also doing it in a scenario where he was actively involved in the crime itself.\"\n\nPardons are not meant to be \"a reward for political loyalists,\" Bloch said. There are people serving \"extraordinarily excessive sentences for crimes\" who may be more deserving of being pardoned, but Bloch said now he's worried Trump's abuse of the pardon power may cause the general public to disapprove of using the practice at all.\n\nBloch also worries that newly pardoned Jan. 6 rioters, especially those who were part of extremist movements or displayed unique acts of violence, will take the news of their pardon as yet more proof that Trump approves of their actions.\n\nEvidence at Jan. 6 trials showed defendants \"expressly viewed themselves as Trump's army and talked about committing an all-out war to keep Trump in power,\" Bloch said.\n\nIf any pardoned Jan. 6 rioters go on to commit other criminal offenses, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1914 that their pardoned offense could still be weighed by courts under something known as \" habitual offender laws .\" The high court ruled in Carlesi v. New York that while a pardon may effectively wipe away a federal crime, that criminal record can still be considered if there is recidivism going forward.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, so many Oath Keepers were charged with seditious conspiracy that they could not all physically fit in the courthouse's chamber at the same time. Instead, over a dozen Oath Keepers accused of a variety of crimes - including seditiously conspiring to stop the transfer of power, obstructing Congress, assaulting and impeding police and tampering with evidence - were tried in batches over a series of weeks.\n\nJurors reviewed a vast trove of Oath Keepers' text messages and forensic data. They listened to phone calls and voicemails and watched extensive video footage of the attack. They listened to firsthand accounts from Oath Keepers who said the group was ready to go to war to overturn the election, and they heard from FBI special agents as well as former and current members of the group. Rhodes took the stand at one point, offering defiant testimony in which he painted himself as the savior of a movement to keep Trump in power and to keep Trump's supporters \"safe.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination, Rhodes told prosecutors he wanted Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act because, he believed, only then could the president expose the election fraud and leak sensitive data, including information he believed would out government officials as pedophiles. Trump, Rhodes said, had a constitutional duty, \"just like Lincoln,\" to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nRhodes' associate and Oath Keeper Florida chapter leader Kelly Meggs was sentenced to 12 years for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Rhodes and Meggs' co-defendants at trial included Oath Keeper and former founder of the Ohio Regular Militia Jessica Watkins, Florida Oath Keeper Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell, a veteran Navy intelligence officer. They were acquitted of seditious conspiracy but convicted on other charges.\n\nWatkins led fellow Oath Keepers in an aggressive push through the Capitol, recruited new members and communicated with Oath Keepers leadership about an arsenal of weapons stashed just outside Washington, D.C., known as a \"quick reaction force.\" At trial, she tearfully declared to jurors that she was \" just another idiot running around the Capitol ,\" but she was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2023.\n\nHarrelson received a four-year sentence after he was convicted for obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging duties, and tampering with documents or proceedings. A federal judge ruled that the 53 days Caldwell spent in detention after he was first arrested in 2021 was sufficient for his conviction on a single count of tampering with evidence, according to CBS affiliate WUSA9 .\n\nThe other Oath Keepers convicted of seditious conspiracy and who prosecutors said helped oversee the weapons arsenal were: Roberto Minuta of Texas, Joseph Hackett and David Moerschel of Florida, and Edward Vallejo of Arizona. Minuta was sentenced to just over four years in prison; Hackett was sentenced to just over three years; and Moerschel and Vallejo were each sentenced to three years.\n\nAll of their sentences were commuted.\n\nOther Oath Keepers found guilty of conspiring to stop police or of obstructing an official proceeding were Connie Meggs, wife to Rhodes' seditious conspiracy co-defendant Kelly Meggs; another husband-and-wife duo, Sandra and Bennie Parker; and Oath Keepers William Isaacs and Laura Steele.\n\nEarly on in the Justice Department's probe of Jan. 6, Oath Keepers Brian Ulrich and Joshua James pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and cooperated extensively with investigators. Both James and Ulrich admitted that on Jan. 6, they were willing to use lethal force against anyone who would dare keep Trump from the White House, despite his 2020 electoral defeat by Joe Biden .\n\nJames, who was tapped as Roger Stone's security guard on Jan. 6, admitted to prosecutors that even after Oath Keepers had failed to stop the transfer of power, he and Rhodes kept amassing guns and more tactical equipment ahead of Biden's inauguration in 2021.\n\nAs for the Proud Boys, Tarrio, who at the time was the leader of the self-proclaimed \"western chauvinist\" group, and chapter leaders, including Joe Biggs, Ethan Nordean and Zachary Rehl, were all convicted of seditious conspiracy. Their co-defendant at trial, Dominic Pezzola, was charged with seditious conspiracy but was the only member of the group acquitted on that count. Prosecutors and the judge in Pezzola's case saw his use of a stolen police riot shield to smash open a window and let rioters stream inside the Capitol as an integral spark to the chaos and violence of Jan. 6.\n\nTarrio was not on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 after developing what prosecutors said was a useful alibi for his whereabouts. Instead, Tarrio watched the violence unfold from a hotel room in Maryland as he cheered on his \"boys\" on social media. He took credit for the destruction in chat messages with Jeremy Bertino, a former Proud Boys member who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy before Tarrio's trial ever got underway.\n\nA Supreme Court decision in June to narrow the meaning of a charge applied in dozens of Jan. 6 cases - obstructing an official proceeding - theoretically benefited many Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and individual rioters. But the Justice Department reported in January that just six defendants had received a sentencing reduction because of the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nTarrio, according to CBS News , was expected to be reunited with his family in Miami on Monday. An attorney for Tarrio expressed gratitude to Trump, saying it \"marks a pivotal moment in our client's life, and symbolizes a turning point for our nation.\"\n\n\"We are optimistic for the future as we now turn the page on this chapter, embracing new possibilities and opportunities,\" attorney Nayib Hassan said.\n\nPolice officers like Michael Fanone who were brutalized by rioters expressed a profound sense of betrayal upon learning about the pardons. Fanone told CNN 's Anderson Cooper on Monday that he, his children and his family are \"less safe because of Donald Trump and his supporters.\"\n\nBiden issued preemptive pardons to members of the Jan. 6 congressional committee, investigators and police officers who defended the Capitol out of an abundance of concern that they would be targeted by punitive litigation from the incoming Trump administration.\n\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn said he wished Biden's pardon wasn't necessary but \"unfortunately, the political climate we are in now has made the need for one somewhat of reality,\" he said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\nDunn said he was just \"doing my job and upholding my oath\" that day.\n\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell also told HuffPost on Monday: \"I can't believe I need a pardon for doing the right thing while the person who set Jan. 6 in motion is inaugurated.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Rhodes was found guilty of orchestrating a weekslong plot that culminated in his followers attacking the U.S. Capitol in a desperate bid to keep Trump in power.\n\nRhodes' visit comes on the same day that Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson revived a special committee to investigate the riot, an effort to defend Trump's actions that day and dispute the work of a bipartisan committee that investigated the siege two years ago. Johnson said Tuesday that he would not second guess Trump's decision to pardon the rioters and that \"we believe in redemption, we believe in second chances.\"\n\nRhodes, who arrived at on Capitol Hill wearing a Trump 2020 hat, said he was at the Capitol to advocate for the release of another defendant. Rhodes was among 14 Jan. 6 defendants whose sentences were commuted. He told reporters he would be pushing Trump to grant him a full pardon.\n\nJudges in Washington's federal court spent Wednesday dismissing a slew of cases against Jan. 6 defendants that were still pending. Several judges took the opportunity in written orders to lament the abrupt end to the prosecutions, saying Trump's mass pardons won't change the truth about the mob's attack on a bastion of American democracy,\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said evidence of the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol is preserved through the \"neutral lens\" of riot videos, trial transcripts, jury verdicts and judicial opinions.\n\n\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies,\" she wrote.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who presided over Trump's election interference case before its dismissal, said the president's pardons for hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters can't change the \"tragic truth\" about the attack. Chutkan added that her order dismissing the case against an Illinois man who was charged with firing a gun into the air during the riot cannot \"diminish the heroism of law enforcement officers\" who defended the Capitol.\n\n\"It cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake,\" Chutkan wrote . \"And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"\n\nChutkan and Kollar-Kotelly are among over 20 judges to handle the hundreds of cases produced by the largest investigation in the Justice Department's history. Kollar-Kotelly issued her written remarks in an order dismissing the case against Dominic Box , a Georgia man who was among the first group of rioters to enter the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nOther judges at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., spoke out against pardons for Capitol rioters before Trump's second inauguration on Monday, when the Republican president pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of charges in all of the 1,500-plus Capitol riot criminal cases.\n\nDistrict Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump nominee, said in November that handing out blanket pardons to Capitol rioters would be \" beyond frustrating and disappointing .\" Nichols expressed his criticism during a hearing at which he agreed to postpone a Jan. 6 riot defendant's trial until after Trump's return to the White House.\n\nDuring a hearing last month, District Judge Amit Mehta said it would be \"frightening\" if Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes is pardoned for orchestrating a violent plot to keep Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election. Rhodes was serving an 18-year sentence when he was released from prison this week.\n\nBox, who was featured in the HBO documentary \"Four Hours at the Capitol,\" was found guilty of charges including interfering with police during a civil disorder, a felony. The judge convicted Box last year after a \"stipulated bench trial,\" which meant she decided the case based on facts that both sides agreed to before the trial started.\n\nBox was scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21. More than 130 other convicted rioters were awaiting sentencing when Trump issued pardons.\n\nJohn Banuelos , 39, of Illinois, was awaiting trial in a Washington jail when Chutkan dismissed charges that he climbed scaffolding outside the Capitol, pulled what appeared to be a gun from his waistband and fired two shots into the air.\n\n\"In hundreds of cases like this one over the past four years, judges in this district have administered justice without fear or favor,\" Chutkan wrote. \"The historical record established by those proceedings must stand, unmoved by political winds, as a testament and as a warning.\"\n\nNearly 1,600 people were charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. More than 1,000 of them pleaded guilty. Approximately 250 others were convicted by a judge or jury after trials. Over 1,100 were sentenced, with more than 700 receiving a term of imprisonment ranging from several days to 22 years .\n\nOver 130 police officers were injured during the riot. At least four officers who were at the Capitol later died by suicide. And Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died after engaging with the protesters. A medical examiner later determined he died of natural causes.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

But this kind of law enforcement collusion with the far right is a profound threat to democracy.\n\nEnri­que Tarrio, former chairman of the Proud Boys, was found guilty Thursday, May 4, 2023, of seditious conspiracy in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. He is seen here in Miami, where he lives, on July 16, 2021. (Pedro Portal / Miami Herald / Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe news that four members of the far-right organization the Proud Boys were just convicted for seditious conspiracy, including their former leader Enrique Tarrio, has made the rounds this week. But if you only tuned in to the proceedings a few days ago to read about the verdict, there's something you almost certainly haven't heard: that both Tarrio and as many as eight other Proud Boys were secretly FBI informants, in part helping law enforcement to target Black Lives Matter protesters and other left-wing activists.\n\nThat's because, after a non-exhaustive survey of reports covering the verdict, I discovered that only two news outlets, the Associated Press (AP) and the Washington Post , mentioned that government informants were present within the Proud Boys' ranks, even though this fact was among the most shocking revelations that came out in the course of the trial.\n\nThat fact doesn't just make the FBI's failure to detect and prevent the Capitol riot even more baffling. Revelations from the trial suggested that the FBI's historical and ongoing fixation on left-wing protests potentially blinded it to the threat of the far right, and that the bureau is even happy to collaborate with far-right groups as a way of neutralizing what it sees as a greater threat from the Left.\n\nThe AP's reference was perfunctory - contained in a single line about how \"revelations of government informants in the group\" prolonged the trial - leaving the Post as the one and only news outlet that specified that Tarrio himself was a longtime informer for law enforcement in a wide range of groups beyond and before the Proud Boys. His own lawyer called him a \" prolific \" informer in a 2014 court proceeding.\n\nThat includes mainstream outlets like CBS , ABC , NBC , and USA Today , as well as Forbes , Reuters , Bloomberg , and Business Insider . This fact was also absent from both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal's reports, as well as Politico's , nor was it mentioned by the BBC or the Philadelphia Inquirer . Even Al Jazeera failed to inform its audience about this key piece of information, as did outlets like NPR and CNN , the latter of which only offhandedly and vaguely mentioned \"newly unveiled evidence and informants\" in a list of factors that had led to \"countless delays\" in the trial. The only reference to be found in Rolling Stone's report was a sentence about how \"the trial was not a bonanza of new information,\" aside from \"a witness that the defense hoped to call [being] revealed at the last moment to have been an FBI informant.\"\n\nBut this is a misleading description of the trial. As the Washington Post - the only one of these outlets that seemed to consider the Proud Boys' law enforcement links important enough to inform readers about - reported a month ago, government informants were not only rife within the far-right organization, but the \"evidence shown in court indicates that many of the FBI sources inside the Proud Boys were asked only about their ideological opponents on the left.\"\n\nExplicitly progressive or liberal-leaning outlets were no better than the mainstream. Tarrio and other Proud Boys' status as FBI informers was absent from Mother Jones's write-up on the verdict, as well as those of the Guardian , Vice , Huff Post , and Salon . Democracy Now! stated that one police officer \"had a relationship prior to January 6th with Tarrio, because he was gathering information from the extremist groups amassing there.\" Besides ignoring the revelations, MSNBC went further and turned its reporting into something of a defense of the entities that had collaborated with the Proud Boys, calling the verdict a \"massive win for the government\" and warning that a failure to convict \"would have emboldened the nation's militia movement and congressional firebrands\" who wanted to challenge federal law enforcement.\n\nWhat's particularly bizarre about this is that many of the outlets listed above - including the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , Reuters , Associated Press , and Vice - have reported previously on the trial's exposure of the extent of FBI infiltration into the Proud Boys, as well as Tarrio's work with law enforcement specifically .\n\nIt could be that these outlets are loath to mention just how extensively law enforcement worked with the group lest they be viewed as assisting the Proud Boys' defense, which had pointed to the FBI's failure to prevent the incident despite having infiltrated the group as proof that the storming of the Capitol had been unplanned. They may also be wary of appearing to side with right-wing allegations that January 6 was a \" fedsurrection \" organized wholesale by federal law enforcement, a conspiracy theory circulated on the Right that has revolved around dubious and unproven claims that a rioter named Ray Epps was an undercover agent - claims Epps himself has strenuously denied .\n\nBut the failure to mention the FBI's infiltration into the Proud Boys cuts across ideological lines. Neither Fox News nor the right-leaning New York Post included the Proud Boys's FBI connections in their reports, despite both outlets having taken an increasingly adversarial stance toward the bureau since the 2016 election.\n\nThis failure isn't trivial. As the Washington Post put it in March, the FBI's presence within the Proud Boys \"underscores the intelligence failures in advance of January 6, as the FBI was unprepared for the riot despite having inroads into the groups now accused by the Justice Department of plotting the violence.\" Those failures are as copious and serious as they are still mysterious: one of Liz Cheney's last acts in office was to block the January 6 committee's investigation into law enforcement failures regarding the event, and several disclosures have raised the specter of Trumpist sympathies within both the Secret Service and the FBI.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the media's failure to mention the FBI's link to the Proud Boys ensures that law enforcement agencies face no accountability for their stunning failures on the day, ironically making a repeat of the Capitol riot far more likely. More alarmingly, it means the long-standing and well-documented sympathies toward the far right that exist to a concerning level inside US law enforcement won't be cleaned up, but stay unexamined and sealed away from public scrutiny - until, at least, the next time it threatens US democracy.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

But conservatives' complete disconnect from reality is nowhere near enough to dislodge them from power.\n\nAnti-vaxx protesters gather in front of city hall in Los Angeles, California, August 14, 2021.

Financial firms making bad investment decisions because they are too \" woke .\" Plots to replace white people with immigrants. QAnon . Only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI won't bore you with a laundry list of kooky conservative ideas; just read the newspaper on any given idea and you get the idea. The point is, from the grassroots to the halls of Congress and the Supreme Court, many important right-wing activists are out of touch with basic aspects of reality. And they are not embarrassed to show it in public, doubling and tripling down on one demonstrably false claim after another, even when it's not obvious how it helps them with voters.\n\nDespite its penchant for the ridiculous, the Right remains far more effective at altering reality than liberals or leftists are. This paradox of American politics has been around for some time. The most consequential recent example is the country's disastrous war of choice against Iraq, based entirely on lies, cynical manipulation, and smarmy optimism.\n\nBut there has been an important advance, starting during Donald Trump's first campaign. Right-wing elites and the grassroots now work in far closer cooperation than they did before Trump, both in terms of cocreating an increasingly abstract alternate reality to inhabit and in making concrete changes to the real political landscape. Spurred on by ideas with no basis in reality, they nonetheless are the primary force setting the political agenda and influencing the reality we all really live in. Given the conservative stranglehold over the federal judiciary, the right-wing grassroots' increasing enthusiasm for committing violence, and GOP elites' blasé, wink-wink reactions to it, there is plenty of reason to worry.\n\nThe January 6 attempted insurrection provides perhaps the clearest insight into this dynamic. This week, prosecutors shared private messages sent by Stewart Rhodes, the head of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia, during his trial for his part in the uprising. In addition to referring to Democrats as Marxists and Joe Biden specifically as a puppet of the Communist Party of China, Rhodes was prone to portentously quoting George Washington and comparing himself to the country's first president.\n\nSure, Rhodes sounds like a doofus. But he also allegedly organized a mob that shut down Congress in the middle of an important session and almost blocked a peaceful transfer of power - a plot that likely also involved dozens of Republican elected officials and Trump himself. Rhodes was never going to be George Washington, but he came close to making history.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the conservative ultra-insider Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. While Rhodes and plenty of others planned to violently stop Congress from fulfilling its constitutional obligation, Thomas harangued Republican officials in multiple states to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which she maintains to this day , against all evidence, Donald Trump won.\n\nOften forgotten in the revelations about the insurrection is the fact that, even on January 6 itself, almost 150 Republicans in Congress objected to certifying Joe Biden's victory as president, in part to delay the proceedings and give rioters more time to make their way inside the Capitol. Fake news, very real consequences - from the roots of the party to the top.\n\nDuring the George W. Bush and Barack Obama years, it was common for liberals and leftists to think that Republicans spouting obvious nonsense were operating from pure cynicism, and that pointing out their hypocrisy would shame them out of it, or at least turn voters against them. There is no evidence that this worked on an appreciable scale. Voters continue to support the Republicans, give or take a couple percentage points every two years. The GOP generally continues to support even its biggest hypocrites . Even now, the Right arguably exerts almost as much influence as it did when Trump was in the White House and Republicans controlled Congress.\n\nElite cynicism is surely part of the mix, but something else is going on. It is hard to see people like Stewart Rhodes as cynical. Facing years in prison for \"seditious conspiracy\" isn't generally something you do unless you mean it. Nor is it something you simply bumble into. We can't reduce the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys , or similar groups to mere suckers of a cynical party elite. They spent years preparing to do something exactly like what they did on January 6. When the people who run the Republican Party - some tacitly, some much more explicitly - gave them the opportunity, they were ready.\n\nRecently, the New York Times reported on how talk about \"civil war\" on the Right increased by 3,000 percent after the FBI raided Trump's Florida estate. But even Republican publicity hounds like Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Texas governor Greg Abbott are not going to secede from the union for the clout (though according to the Times , Trump's former national security advisor thinks they can). More likely is a long slog of low-level violence punctuated by larger manufactured crises similar to the events of January 6 - a slow grinding-down of legal and political opposition until it functionally no longer exists beyond unctuous pleas for compromise and self-righteous grandstanding about how unfair it all is.\n\nOr maybe it will go much faster than that, who knows? Republicans are hell-bent on breaking every norm of democratic governance, and Democrats seem unwilling to mount a serious challenge to stop them as long as they can keep raising money off the threat. For their part, the American people sense that things aren't going well. An August poll revealed that more than 40 percent of Americans think a civil war could happen in the next decade, as does almost 55 percent of the Republican base.\n\nSure, it sounds ridiculous - but the Right is changing American politics in ways that are as dangerous as they are absurd.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe trial of Rasmea Odeh - feminist, community organizer, Palestinian refugee - is entering its fourth day. The US government is targeting Odeh as part of a coordinated, multi-pronged attack on Palestinians in the United States, aiming to cut off Palestinians in exile from the struggle in their homeland and to further shatter the Palestinian national movement.\n\nBy attempting to destroy what the Reut Report has called \"hubs\" of the organizing effort, the US government is in effect carrying out a counterinsurgency operation against both Palestinians in this country as well as their supporters. To that end, the government has repeatedly attempted to link Palestinians in exile to what it calls \"terror.\" By using \"terror lists,\" for example, it has successfully managed to prevent Palestinians in the United States from offering support to any of the Palestinian political parties that have not caved in to the Zionist project.\n\nThe government has also used those lists to criminalize purely humanitarian efforts to strengthen Palestinian society - most notoriously in the case of the Holy Land Five . Furthermore, the US government has sought to judicially harass and disrupt any and all Palestinian exile formations. The prosecution of Odeh is one example of that ongoing persecution.\n\nWhat follows is an interview with Michael Deutsch, one of Odeh's attorneys.\n\nCan you give a capsule summary of how the United States government has gone after Rasmea Odeh?\n\nYes, it began in September 2010. They began to investigate her, and it was part of the investigation they were conducting of the [Arab American Action Network] in Chicago. The US attorney in Chicago requested documents from Israel about her background and history.\n\nUltimately, they received the documents from Israel and they begin to prepare a case against her for basically obtaining her naturalization and citizenship in violation of the law - in other words, in not being truthful in answering the questions on the application. They indicted her about a year ago, and brought her to Detroit to stand trial.\n\nCan you quickly walk us through what the legal strategy was until last week's rulings?\n\nBasically we wanted to show, first of all, that all the documents from Israel were the product of an occupation military judicial system that systemically tortures people to get confessions, that is run by soldiers posing as judges, that doesn't provide you with access to counsel until you've already confessed. Therefore we argued that any documents provided through that system were in violation of international law and US law and shouldn't be admitted to the courtroom.\n\nIn addition we wanted to show that because she was so viciously and horrifically tortured, she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], she's been evaluated and diagnosed with that. That resulted in her basically blocking what happened to her in Israel when she was asked the questions in her naturalization application about whether she had ever been arrested, convicted, or imprisoned.\n\nShe interpreted that to mean imprisoned and convicted and arrested in the United States. She had been in the United States for nine years, and had a green card, and when she went for her naturalization, she assumed they were asking her about her background in the US.\n\nWhat she didn't know at that time, which she later found out after the indictment, is she had PTSD. What happens with someone who has PTSD is they cognitively block past trauma to avoid having to deal with it. So when she interpreted the questions to simply be asking about the United States, it was not only that but her PTSD blocking past trauma.\n\nOur defense was multifaceted: keep out the documents, show the jury the illegality of the military tribunal, then put out an expert who examined her and evaluated her and said she had PTSD. The judge allowed in the documents, he blocked any testimony of torture - or innocence - because we wanted to say she was innocent, she confessed under torture, and he blocked the PTSD defense, and kept the expert out.\n\nCan you just clarify the legal strategy and the ruling linked to the Israeli documents - how is that banned according to US law?\n\nWell, it is inconsistent with due process and fundamental fairness - if you have a conviction that's based on torture, you don't allow that.\n\nIn US courts they don't allow convictions based on torture. In the United States you have judges who are supposedly impartial, and you don't have civilians being put on trial in military court where the judges are military officers who are involved in the invasion and occupation of your land.\n\nSo the whole process is illegitimate, and they shouldn't be using any information obtained through that process in a US court.\n\nCan you tell us what, if any, legal options are remaining?\n\nShe's charged with knowingly answering questions falsely. Knowingly means not innocently, not mistakenly; knowingly means with the intent to lie. Even keeping out her PTSD, and keeping in the military documents, they have to prove she knowingly answered the questions falsely. She maintains she interpreted the questions to apply to the United States, not foreign convictions or imprisonments.\n\nCan you talk about how the persecution of Rasmea Odeh fits into the broader pattern of what you've called the \"domestic counter-insurgency?\"\n\nYes, I think this is part of a campaign to suppress the Palestinian people living in the US who want to educate US people about the occupation and the attacks on Gaza, and the attacks on the Palestinian people. So what they've done is target the Arab American Action Network. Also they target people who travel and visit the Middle East. I think it is an intentional effort by the United States and the Israelis to suppress the truth about Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people.\n\nThe prosecution of Rasmea is part of the attacks on students on campuses - Palestinian students on campuses who are trying to educate and organize around Palestine. And it's about the people who were subpoenaed to the grand jury in Chicago, twenty-three of them, many of them worked or went on trips to the Middle East and the occupied territories. It's about the people whose homes were raided in 2010 who were doing Palestine solidarity.\n\nIt is all part of a campaign to disrupt and neutralize Palestinian solidarity work.\n\nAnd can you trace this back a little historically - you've spoken of similar techniques used against Puerto Rican activists?\n\nMany of us are familiar with the counterintelligence program that targeted the rise of a black messiah - a program that sought to disrupt and neutralize the black liberation movement. The Puerto Rican independence movement was similarly targeted and in the course of prosecuting members of the Puerto Rican independence movement, they instituted a lot of repressive changes in the judicial system.\n\nFor example, they put in anonymous juries, they allowed secret cameras to be put in people's homes, they talked about terrorism, and at the trials said you couldn't raise the issue of colonialism and Puerto Rican independence. They kept the politics out. They also brought very stiff and hard sentences against people who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, which has hardly ever been used, but it is a conspiracy to oppose the authority of the United States by force.\n\nAnd so by charging people with seditious conspiracy, anyone who was a member of a clandestine group that they determined to be illegal, whether they did anything or not, could be prosecuted or imprisoned for up to twenty years.\n\nAnd what forms of support can be helpful at this point?\n\nWell - public support, here in Detroit. There was an op-ed piece by Angela Davis in support for Rasmea, there was an open letter to Obama and the Justice Department signed by over one hundred feminist scholars in support for Rasmea. People come from Chicago to bear witness, they go to court, they fill the court room, and they're demonstrating outside the court.\n\nAll those things have an impact and are helpful in terms of building support and educating people about her case.\n\nMichael Deutsch is one of Rasmea Odeh's lawyers.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

You're going to hear a lot about how former president Donald Trump's rhetoric inspired those who stormed the Capitol, about how he refused to acknowledge his election loss, that he pressured various officials to overturn the result, and that he egged on his followers and fanned the flames of violence. You will hear the top-line news that the committee has made unprecedented criminal referrals for Trump and others based on their conduct that day.

The vast majority of those who stormed the Capitol weren't members of far-right militias, most weren't carrying firearms, and it's not clear how many even knew they'd be storming the Capitol on the day, since even members of the Oath Keepers who were later charged with seditious conspiracy were found to have no such plans in advance . Instead, most were an eccentric fringe of rank-and-file conservatives and Trump supporters who'd been poisoned by endless waves of cable news bullshit about election fraud and had no idea what to do once they, to their own surprise, actually found themselves inside the building.\n\nWhat could have turned out far, far worse fortunately ended with only one, nevertheless tragic, shooting: that of an unarmed protester by a Capitol police officer, after she tried to breach the barricades protecting the lobby to the House chamber where dozens of lawmakers were holed up. That it did not turn out worse was no thanks to the United States' vast and expensive national security apparatus.\n\nHow did law enforcement drop the ball so badly? Why were numerous warnings from within multiple agencies serially not acted on? What exactly was the role of the Secret Service in everything that happened? The reason you won't get answers to these and other related questions can be summed up in two words: Liz Cheney.\n\nYes, the GOP congresswoman-turned-liberal icon reportedly used her position as cochair of the January 6 committee, which put her in the driver's seat to shape the inquiry, to protect law enforcement from public accountability over its failures, just as a whistleblower had alleged some unnamed members of Congress had done. Despite conducting more than a hundred interviews and depositions with officials across multiple law enforcement agencies, which was explicitly part of the committee's mission, committee staffers working on this issue were suddenly given a \"pens down\" order one day in November and told the final report would focus mostly on Trump, NBC News previously reported.\n\nLater that month, the Washington Post drew on the testimony of fifteen former and current committee staffers to report that it was Cheney, who had \"exerted a remarkable level of control over much of the committee's public and private work,\" who pushed to narrow the committee's findings to the former president and his actions. According to the Post , staff became so disillusioned over the fact that months of work was going to be unceremoniously dumped that they simply left, and others complained to the paper that the whole enterprise \"became a Cheney 2024 campaign.\"\n\nThere's no doubt Cheney is a grandstander par excellence, someone who attached herself like a remora to Trump for years until it looked like he was set to lose in 2020, only for his ongoing hold over the GOP to backfire on her ― and drive her to start posturing as a principled \"Never Trumper\" in the hope of saving her political skin. Incidentally, it's exactly this cynical, Trump-fixated grandstanding that led outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to plop Cheney in the cochair's position on the January 6 committee, giving her the power to shape that investigation the way she has.\n\nBut while Cheney's desperation explains a lot of this, we should also realize there's a nakedly ideological motivation to it. \"What we aren't gonna do, Bret, is blame the Capitol Police, blame those in law enforcement, for Donald Trump's armed mob that he sent to the Capitol,\" Cheney told Fox News' Bret Baier back in July. Her spokesperson later reiterated that Cheney wouldn't \"sign onto any 'narrative' that suggests Republicans are inherently racist - or smears men and women in law enforcement\" and that she'd see to it the report \"will not blame federal law enforcement officers for Donald Trump's attack on our democracy.\"\n\nIn other words, Cheney's behind-the-scenes work has served two functions: it's given Cheney oodles of airtime and adoring headlines to set up her future political career, and it's protected the US national security state from facing the music over its stunning failure, a longtime Cheney family priority. Incidentally, this only raises the risk of this kind of failure happening again and is therefore a well-timed Christmas gift to the very pro-Trump right Cheney pretends to be fighting whenever there's a camera and a microphone in spitting distance.\n\nThe Cheney-neutered report is still significant, as are the criminal referrals, and Trump and his cronies clearly should be prosecuted for trying to steal an election. And it seems at least some of the staffers' investigation into law enforcement will at least be included in an appendix, though this will dramatically narrow the impact of the findings as well as limit the amount of detail we learn.\n\nBut this issue, and the world in general, is a lot bigger than Trump, something you would think the establishment would've learned by now. Over the past year or so, we've gotten more and more of an idea of the scope of law enforcement's failure on that day and some darker hints of possible far-right sympathies and even collusion with Trump within those agencies ― even as their powers and funding have been alarmingly expanded in response to their own failure. The January 6 committee had a duty to sort fact from hearsay on the matter and tell us what exactly went wrong and why. Thanks to one of Trump's former stalwart allies, it seems we won't.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTrump's troops, summoned by the Líder Máximo, assembled in Washington, DC, their minds mangled by an ideological fusillade of conspiratorial tripe about frauds, stolen elections, and political betrayal. The Commander-in-Chief appeared with others at the Washington rally. He and his entourage did not disappoint the crowd, pillorying the \"radical socialist\" Democrats and Republican renegades, excoriating those who would grant Joe Biden the presidency on the basis of an electoral travesty.\n\nThere was talk of \"patriots kicking ass,\" and exhortations to \"Fight, fight, fight!\" Trump wept tears of rage, tears of grief, reminiscent of Bob Dylan and The Band's lyrics from Music from Big Pink (1967-68): \"We carried you in our arms on Independence Day / And now you'd throw us all aside and put us all away / Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun could treat a father so? / To wait upon him hand and foot and always tell him, 'No.'\"\n\nThe election, Trump claimed, was stolen from him and, by extension, from them, his loyal subjects. They were a motley crew: overwhelmingly white, the old and not-quite-so-old, if not too many who were young. Donning the colors of the Proud Boys, biker gangs, and white supremacists, many were the kinds of human material it is easy to loathe, including neofascistic combatants trained in the paramilitary wing of the far right.\n\nBut there were undoubtedly marginalized and poor people among the Trumpers as well. Unemployed or reduced to the most precarious of livelihoods, these men and women are guilty of much, including stupidity, but given their lack of political representation, and the absence of a genuine voice addressing their needs, the illusions Trump promotes nurture a false consciousness that is truly tragic.\n\nOthers among the \"Fight for Trump\" crowd, buying into the \"Wild Time\" promised by the presidential twitter feed, were independent contractors, self-employed professionals, the pettiest of the petty bourgeoisie. And there were fundamentalist Christians rubbing shoulders with nihilistic grifters. These were the shock troops, ready to rock.\n\nSome notables, like Rudy Giuliani, shared the outdoor stage with Trump, speaking from behind the plexiglass-protected dais, calling for \"Trial by Combat.\" Brave talk that would not, of course, be followed by the walk. Like Giuliani, the speculative and parasitic elements of capital that sustain Trumpism materially were not likely to take their politics to the streets; they watched the proceedings from afar.  Nonetheless, such billionaires are decisive in sustaining the Trump coalition, as the likes of Ted Cruz and his co-objectors appreciate so well.\n\nCalling on his followers to be strong, to never concede defeat, and to march on the Biden confirmation proceedings, Trump said he would join the procession down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, only to disappear into the White House, partake of a nice lunch, and watch the televised spectacle unfold. As Marx wrote in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte : \"When you play the fiddle at the top of the state, what else is to be expected but that those down below dance.\"\n\nForty thousand in number, the Trump throng assembled under the flags of the United States, the Klan's conception of the Confederacy, and the Tea Party's favored Colonel Christopher Gadsden standard (designed during the American Revolution, a coiled rattlesnake poised on a yellow background over the words \"Don't Tread on Me\"). But the day's banner of choice was simply emblazoned \"TRUMP.\"\n\nThe angry crowd soon surrounded and then overwhelmed the Capitol, seat of the deliberative branch of the US government. Members of the Senate and their counterparts in the House of Representatives, going through the ritual of formally constituting the composition of the Electoral College that would establish Biden as the president-elect, were blithely unaware of what was happening outside of their sanctuary.\n\nThe most bellicose of Trump's ragtag brigade no doubt wanted to confront Mike Pence, their contempt for what they regarded as his Judas-like act of betrayal in overseeing Biden's coronation ramped up by Trump's escalating petulance. Some among them constructed a mock gallows, from which was suspended a menacing noose. Among this contingent of the crowd the chant of choice was, \"Hang Mike Pence!\"\n\nSkirmishes ensued and soon a significant number of the Never Bideners entered the Capitol building, backing police into corridors, and taking over hallways, offices, and eventually forcing the presidential confirmation proceedings into retreat. The good men and women of the Congress took to the aisle floors, donning gas masks, or were evacuated to shelter and safety.\n\nAs the Trump supporters broke windows and battered doors, they gained entry to a number of chambers, including the Senate. One protester, sporting his COVID-19 mask and clowning around for the cameras, took Vice President Pence's usual seat, his fist raised in defiant salute.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel seemed not quite able to get themselves on the same page. At times battalions of police battled the determined demonstrators. Contingents of cops in full riot gear were crushed by the advancing wall of Trump's supporters, who were clearly in no mood to be stopped. There were, however, other scenes, less confrontational, more chummy. Some officers gave up the apparent ghost of guardianship rather quickly and easily, shunting metal fencing aside to let the crowd flow through or stepping away from a barricaded door and, essentially, abandoning their posts.\n\nA thirty-five-year old woman, Air Force veteran, QAnon ideologue, and financially-troubled small business owner, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed as she attempted to crash through a window leading to an area that the protesters had not breached. A fellow Wilder declared in shocked awe: \"They are supposed to shoot BLM [Black Lives Matter], but now they are shooting patriots.\"\n\nThree others died of \"medical emergencies\" such as heart attacks (memo to my fellow out-of-shape older, white men: don't put yourself in the position of being a battering ram for reaction) and dozens of police were hurt. One US Capitol officer, Brian Sicknick, succumbed to injuries apparently sustained when struck in the head with a fire extinguisher.\n\nAlabama GOP Congressman Mo Brooks, whose ultra-inflammatory speech to the Trump rally egged the crowd on to protest at the Capitol, now hails the fallen policeman as a hero, calling for death penalty retribution. As with everything Trumpite, hypocrisy overwhelms reason.\n\nEventually, after a few hours that saw the declaration of a 6 PM curfew and the arrival of massive police and National Guard reserves, the Capitol was cleared, the Electoral College hearings reconvened, and Biden confirmed.  Democracy prevailed; the insurrection was over.\n\nAll of this was broadcast in real time on all major television networks. Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate waxed eloquent about the cherished history of this citadel on a hill, this edifice that enshrines the dream that is American Democracy. A sacred place had been desecrated.\n\nIt had not faced such an invasion of the barbarians since the War of 1812. Thugs and rioters invaded the hallowed halls of the world's \"perfect union,\" where Congress conducts \"the People's Business.\" Media commentators vied with politicos in speeches of disbelief and indignant condemnation, a saccharine rhetoric of American self-satisfaction uniting liberals and conservatives alike.\n\nThe complacent assumption that the ideal of American democracy is not only real, but the beacon to which all progressive and advanced nations aspire, dripped from the mouths of those shocked and stunned by the threatening protest. That this \"anarchy,\" as it was called by television pundits of the Right and the liberal mainstream, was unleashed by the transparent barrage of disinformation emanating from the White House administration, rather than from the scapegoated, vilified forces of Antifa, only added to the incredulity.\n\nIt was not long before the more deranged voices of Trumpism, like Congressmen Brooks, Paul Gosar, and Matt Gaetz, intimated that left-wing, Black Bloc provocateurs were indeed involved in the violence, claims supported by no evidence whatsoever. Trump soon jumped on this bandwagon of balderdash.\n\nNo one dared speak truth to an apparently ideologically unassailable democracy, whose history is hardly one of unblemished good. Questioning the revered record of what has happened within the blessed walls of the Capitol was most decidedly not done in the face of the bad manners, audacious raucousness, intimidating violence, and brazen display of far-right ugliness evident among Trump's riotous advocates.\n\nClaims now abound that among some in the crowd the intent was to kidnap, put on trial, and physically harm office-holding traitors to Trump, like Pence, or hated Democrats, such as Nancy Pelosi. Whether such fears of what the rampaging elements of Trump's rally turned riotous intended to do would have been borne out had the crowd not been contained will never be known.\n\nWhat is certain is that the frightening situation on January 6 suffocated acknowledgement that the American state and its seemingly democratic institutions cry out to be interrogated and scrutinized critically. Whatever the circumstances, the job of the Left is never to whitewash the history of bourgeois democracy and the sins states commit in its name.\n\nThe Capitol Building is where the nation state has sanctified slavery and segregation. Within its walls the pockets of the rich have historically been lined with all kinds of \"honest graft,\" of which the modern tax cut is only the tip of an iceberg of largesse. Legislation drafted there has criminalized the poor and forced austerity measures down their constricted throats, established pernicious racist immigration exclusions, proclaimed and bankrolled wars, kept women in their subordinate domestic place, thwarted workers' struggles, and restricted the rights of the people to health and welfare. Democracy, American-style, has long backed dictators around the world and engineered coups in the name of \"regime change.\"\n\nReligion may well remain an opiate of the people. It certainly found a particular niche in the Trump crowd's politics of grievance. One prominent modern-day Know-Nothing placard proclaimed, \"Pelosi is the Devil,\" while a religious-like demonization of communism could be read on other signboards. Interspersed between \"Trump Is President\" banners were simple declarations that \"Jesus Saves.\" Exactly what was not clear.\n\nTrump? Truth? The electoral process? Or America's privileged place in the world economy? Not people dying by the hundreds of thousands of COVID-19. Not the homeless in New York, Calcutta, or Sao Paulo. Not refugees and jailed dissidents and those whose jobs and lives have been declared redundant in the proliferating crises that scar the landscape of modern capitalism.\n\nYet in the outpouring of resentment and shocked indignation at the temerity and travesty of trashing the Capitol, another opiate surfaced as the drug of choice in an obvious legitimation crisis. A religiously constructed veneration of the ceremonial trappings and ideological obfuscations of American democracy belied the critical truth that after two-and-a-half centuries United States experience still manages to confirm, on an almost daily basis, that some black lives do not matter, that the rich benefit from everything, including pandemic crisis, and the poor take it in the neck.\n\nSacrilege in the modern state is not so much a heretical pronouncement that God has fallen or is fallible. Rather, the mere suggestion that bourgeois democratic governance, and its material structures, are not to be worshipped adoringly - this is the blasphemy of America's national chauvinism.\n\nSedition! Insurrection! Domestic Terrorism! were the thus the words of the hour. January 6 was a day that would live in the history of the United States as one of infamy, likened in its ignominy and dishonor to Pearl Harbor. Hyperbole flowed as the trail of tears grew to a tidal wave.\n\nGeorge W. Bush and almost all other mainstream commentators likened the events of January 6 to \"banana republic\" coups. This gives banana republics and the politics of insurrection within them a bad name. No self-respecting attempted coup d'etat against a dictatorial regime in the developing world would have been willing to settle, as did the so-called insurgents of the Siege of the Capitol, 01/06/21, for a flurry of mayhem, a walk back to the hotel, and a comradely drink and sociable cigarette.\n\nYet Trump's patriot phalanx, some of whom urinated on the Capitol's floors and spread feces on is walls was satisfied with this as its particular day's work. The denouement of a few hours of domestic terror, seditious conspiracy, and violent insurrection was perhaps an indication less of what happened than of what did not.\n\nThe Capitol riot that has sparked such vehement condemnation among liberal commentators and sitting members of the United States Congress was certainly troubling, given the prominent place of white nationalist, fascistic elements within it. But it was no insurrection.\n\nMost of the crowd was not armed, there was no public display of long guns, and bear spray and flag poles were the weapons of choice in battles with the police, hardly the kind of firepower needed to bring the state down. No concerted effort had been made to coordinate a riotous demonstration against a symbol of state power, with actual insurrectionary intent among the military, sections of the media, or many other spheres where power is concentrated and perpetuated.\n\nWhat happened on January 6 was orchestrated chaos, to be sure. It was certainly characterized by violence and determination, as well as a bizarre theater of the absurd, most ostentatiously on display in the person of the horn-sporting, raccoon-skin draped, Jacob Chansley/Jake Ageli, his face painted in the red, white, and blue that matched his chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" Dubbed the QAnon \"shaman,\" Chansley/Ageli suggests how lacking in anything approximating leadership or a coherent governing alternative the tumult of 01/06/21 was prerequisites of any insurrection worth the name. Like so many others who invaded the Capitol building, a flag-carrying Jake justified his presence in the protest by stating that he had been summoned to Washington by Donald Trump.\n\nAn insurrection with Trump at its head is surely destined to derail before a booked tee time or a sumptuous dinner. And it largely did. Trump, who at first reveled in the riot, pushed his sycophants in Congress to use the chaos to derail Biden's confirmation. He stalled when pressed to mobilize the National Guard to clear the Capitol of rioters, instead praising them as patriots whose deeds would not be forgotten, declaring his love for them. Ivanka Trump was, at first, of a like mind.\n\nA day later, Trump's tune changed. Allegations of treason and anguished announcements of former supporters that Trump had finally gone too far, prompted lawyers, aides, and advisors (and almost certainly the inner circle of nepotism so influential in the Oval Office) to insist that the president look after his own interests, protect himself from legal liability for the violence, and backtrack. Conceding an orderly transition to power, and throwing his supporters under the proverbial bus, a seemingly chastened Trump called for those guilty of violent acts to feel the full prosecutorial brunt of the law.\n\nRight-wing social media like Parler and 4chan blew up in contradictory messaging: While some railed against Trump's perfidy, anguishing that they had been sold out, others kept the faith. QAnon nodded knowingly that Trump would never desert the cause, and his public repudiation of the assault on the Capitol was another bit of deep state fakery, or perhaps a hacked hoax perpetrated by Chinese Communists.\n\nMany Trump supporters entwined in the loose knot of a socially constructed seditious conspiracy saw what a non-insurrection they had been whipped up to stage. They departed Washington, less with a bang, than with an audible whimper. Some of them, foolish enough to kindly provide the state with their videos of the events, are now being tracked down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Marshals, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThey face a slew of charges: criminal trespass, assaulting police, disorderly conduct, theft of government property, illegal possession of a firearm, and many other transgressions, including possibly sedition, conspiracy, and murder. Those charged well deserve whatever fate awaits them at the hands of the criminal justice system, responsible as they are for their actions and the repugnant dog's breakfast of motivations that animated them.\n\nCertainly, there were some among the crowd's most prepared and well-trained combatants who are committed cadre of the extreme politics of reaction and willing participants in a raging war of hate and retribution. This dangerous militia-like presence in the Trump crowd no doubt provided a good part of its discipline and preparedness. Unlike their cell-phone touting ballast, these types might well avoid being collateral damage in Trump's insatiable appetite for adoration, refusing to be casualties in a sociopath's sense of entitlement. They will live to fight another day, a dangerous soldiery poisoned by the politics of toxic reaction.\n\nIf the riot at the Capitol buildings was sedition, it was truly a bizarre variant of this high crime against the state. No plan animated Trump's supporters other than to slap down, momentarily, his successor and nemesis. Sedition surely demands something more than a frenzied crowd and some capable militia-like figures willing to scale walls. To actually crown the actions of 01/06/21 a seditious insurrection is, of course, to structure them in ways that further deepens faith in the staying power of a socio-economic order fraying at its capitalist seams.\n\nThe defenders of this crisis-ridden system of exploitation and oppression, having seen an ostensible armed assault on its political caretakers handily put down, can proclaim themselves resilient and redoubtable, as did so many puffed up members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. They now have a platform from which to endlessly proclaim the Republic a bastion of righteousness encompassing liberty and espousing just values, able to vanquish an insurgent challenge with alacrity.\n\nA different assessment is possible. Indeed, the story of this insurrection that wasn't is how the vanguard of Trump's marauders were able to walk up steps of the Capitol Building largely unimpeded, ascend its walls with impunity, fly their flags from scaffolding, breach police barricades, and take over a seat of US government for a time, however brief.\n\nThe indignant invasion of the Capitol would never have gotten within a Molotov cocktail's throw of the building's stately stairways had it been a left-wing protest. Those of us who have seen a few marches on Washington, or Queen's Park or Parliament Hill in Canada, for that matter, know full well that the armed might of the state seldom goes to sleep the way it did on January 6.\n\nThis insurgency would have been stopped in its tracks before it ever got near the Biden confirmation hearings, if it was mobilized by those actually challenging power rather than hoping to sustain one particularly nefarious variant of it. That unique expression of politics - Trumpism - is an ideological edifice which sections of the \"law and order\" industry gravitate to instinctually.\n\nLeft-wing protest, if it threatens constituted authority in any way, has historically been met with unambiguous police force and often brutal repression. Generally, it is the cops that lose their cool in such situations, not the protesters.\n\nThis is what happened at the August 1968 anti-war demonstrations in Chicago during the Democratic Party's National Convention. The entire twelve-thousand-member Chicago police force was placed on rotating twelve-hour shifts; the US Army mobilized six thousand troops to \"protect\" the city, taking their place alongside six thousand National Guards (with an additional five thousand on standby alert), and two thousand Federal Bureau of Investigation and Secret Service agents.\n\nAs the respective forces of peaceniks and state troopers clashed, protesters were pushed through hotel plateglass windows by police, who beat the young demonstrators as they lay sprawled on broken glass. Six hundred arrests ensued; hundreds of injuries were sustained, not only by the dissidents but also by the gendarmes. In the end, the consensus of inquiries into what happened in this 1968 protest is that the police, not the demonstrators, rioted. But you could never say that the cops were not prepared, or that they assembled in insufficient numbers to protect property and the business of politics as usual.\n\n1968's repression was matched by a similar ruthless resolve in 1971. An attempt to shut down the District of Columbia on May Day, 1971, when tens of thousands of anti-war leftists massed at a number of sites to engage in civil disobedience aimed at calling attention to the imperialist carnage in Vietnam, was met with a decisive show of force.\n\nRichard M. Nixon's not-yet-disgraced attorney general, John Mitchell, unleashed thousands of Army troops, marines, and national guards to supplement the Capitol police, the Washington police, and reserves drawn from near and far. With Washington Post reporter Nicholas von Hoffman describing the nation's capital as a \"simulated Saigon,\" the city's traffic circles were designated battle zones, pitting combative protesters against the cops; teargas hung thickly in the air like a rainforest fog; and many a \"Mayday Tribe\" demonstrator had their shins and backs slapped with truncheons, and worse.\n\nRidden down by police horses, tossed into paddy wagons with abandon, twelve thousand were arrested, hauled off without due process, and incarcerated twenty to a two-person cell. Washington's jails soon overflowed, necessitating transporting those in police custody to makeshift detention camps.\n\nAt the \"Battle of the Bicentennial\" in Philadelphia in the summer of 1976, protesters gathered to declare an end to colonialism, and a \"Rich Off Our Backs - July 4th Coalition\" mobilized thousands to demand Puerto Rico's independence and defend the dispossessed of all colors from attack, marching through the streets of the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nWe did not get much love from Philly's police: I recall filing past a park and seeing hundreds of police lining a hilltop, batons menacingly thudding on their riot shields. One of these civic-minded officers turned his back on us, dropped his pants - all of them - and offered us a very unappealing full moon. I suppose this was a gesture preferable to a crack upside the head, but it did not express a lot of regard.\n\nMore recently many have witnessed rampaging police violence at anti-World Trade Organization Summit protests in Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, and Quebec City, or Ontario Coalition of Poverty marches on provincial and federal legislatures in Toronto and Ottawa. The armed might of the state has not been shy in establishing fenced perimeters, pepper spraying demonstrators, kettling protesters, riding down marchers with horses, or corralling them with bicycles, and beating mercilessly on anyone who stepped out of what the police considered a proper line.\n\nPolice and \"intelligence agencies\" often infiltrate left-wing groups organizing protests, sometimes arresting \"ringleaders\" before the actual demonstrations occur. Those who ostensibly incite riot with their words are seldom given a pass, and many have been arrested and put through the wringer of costly and time-consuming trials.\n\nNone of this was evident on January 6. The Capitol Police treated the Trump rally as a legitimate expression of right-thinking dissent. Offers of police reinforcements apparently fell on deaf ears.  In spite of more than ample evidence that Trump's supporters were coming to Washington to raise wild hell and possibly worse, there were apparently no special provisions made, no attempt to put in place the kind of security personnel and protocols that are standard operating procedure in the playbook of state responses to left-wing protests.\n\nThat the American security state somehow missed the signs on extremist, right-wing social media sites of what was coming down on 01/06/21 is, simply, incomprehensible. Mother Jones has reported that in the month leading up to the Trump rally, the phrase, \"Storm the Capitol,\" was used 100,000 times on websites and platforms frequented by the far right.  Quite a few people in a lot of particular places inside the state apparatus and the agencies of policing let Trump's bidding be done by an archetypal \"Church and King\" mob.\n\nThe result was that when the Trump crowd proceeded to the Capitol, it had something of a cakewalk. A few metal barricades were in place, and a modest contingent of police \"guarded\" the Capitol building's entrances.  When the crowd proved unruly and determined to break its way into the legislative chambers, there was simply no stopping it. Indeed, cops moved fencing aside so protesters could enter the Capitol. Even after Ms. Babbitt was shot (one cop or secret security agent obviously did not get the message to handle Trump's troops with kid gloves) an accommodating police escort, menacing in his black helmet, riot suit, and protective body shield, gallantly held the hand of an elderly female Trumper as she sidestepped her way down the Capitol stairs. The tough love the left has come to expect from police at demonstrations was, in the Washington invaded by Trumpists, long on the love and rather short on the tough.\n\nThis is not surprising. Officials at the Capitol and the higher-ups responsible for policing and calling out the National Guard, not to mention many, many cops, are themselves part of Trump's base of support. Police associations, all the more so in a climate of antagonism to the brutality and killing that has made Black Lives Matter into a public watchword, are often committed to Trump's agenda.\n\nThe cops eat up Trump's ratcheted-up rhetoric of coming down hard on urban violence, always coded in racialized terms. They clearly enjoy the President's mockery of a liberal establishment regarded as far too soft on crime and cosmopolitan decay. Police forces in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia, and smaller cities and towns are now acting on tips identifying off-duty cops from their ranks involved in the riotous activities inside the Capitol Building.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that the messaging among the protesters and within broad swaths of the police was that this demonstration was to be given a certain license of a kind that a left-led initiative would never have been granted. Both sides - cops and those storming the Capitol - were perhaps captive of Trump's capacity to foster illusion. People died as a consequence.\n\nThe failures of the police are now subject to denunciation from politicians and pundits. Heads have already rolled; resignations of people in positions of responsibility are trotted out daily. Mainstream liberal commentary rightly points out that if the protesters had been associated with Black Lives Matter they would have been handled far more roughly.\n\nLargely peaceful BLM protesters were arrested and manhandled, tear-gassed, fired on with rubber bullets, and bounced off sidewalks for simply looking askance at the police. Trump's rampaging crowd, in contrast, was at times given a wink and a nod. If some cops were forced to fight, and even appeared to have gotten the worst of it, there were police inside the Capitol and on its steps who clearly had little appetite for battling back the protest.\n\nIt is not wrong to make this comparison between the unequal treatment of blacks and whites. But it is now so self-righteously commonplace that it veers toward the myopic. Nancy Pelosi has declared that the insurrectionists chose \"their whiteness over democracy.\" Joy Reid, an MSNBC newscaster, insisted that the Trump throng enjoyed and indeed consciously exploited their white privilege.\n\nThe danger with this kind of interpretation, as the scholar Adolph Reed would point out, is that it obscures as much as it illuminates. That white supremacy was at work among those rallying to Trump and assailing those who would deny his false claims on the presidency is undeniable. That this was the entirety of what happened on January 6 is, however, unconvincing. It misses important dimensions of what was going on.\n\nWhat privileged the Trump crowd in the eyes of many cops was less the color of the protesters' skin - as white as they undoubtedly were - and more their politics of right-wing indignation and demand for redress of a plethora of grievances. Race was undoubtedly an important component of this political disaffection, but a lot more was also swirling in the witch's brew on which the Trump crowd was drunk and disorderly. It was the totality of this concoction that softened up some of the cops.\n\nMany white protesters have found themselves on the wrong, and occasionally lethal, side of law's vengeance. From the time of the execution of the Haymarket martyrs of 1886 and before, whiteness has not bought class struggle militants of the Left a pass as they challenge the power of capital and the state. Militant working-class revolutionaries, such as the members of the Industrial Workers of the World - white, black, immigrant, Mexican-American, and of mixed ancestry such as Frank Little - were tarred and feathered, castrated, hung from bridge trestles, and run out of town.\n\nNot all whites enjoy the privilege of their skin color when confronting police or the retribution of extra-legal posses and menacing night riders. Striking men and women aspiring to establish and sustain trade unions have been shot down by cops, punctuating the struggle for collective bargaining rights with blood. Left demonstrations, their ranks composed of a multiethnic, multiracial coalition of dissenters, have routinely been brutalized by police, as many veterans of the 1930s, the 1960s, and activists of more recent years well know.\n\nForgetting this formidable and ongoing history is something more than merely a reflection of the short and limiting memory of television newscasters and mainstream politicians, who generally have the historical attention span of a two-year-old. What it signifies is the capacity of a liberal mainstream to soapbox on the political terrain that it sees as respectable and justified, defending a politics of racial inclusion (which no leftist would oppose) that is nonetheless presented in ways that obliterates both the history of a left-wing politics of challenge and the state's universally heavy-handed response to this.\n\nThe state and its considerable apparatus of repression responded to Trump's supporters with an incoherence bred of ambivalence. Trump's legions seemed to some in positions of power and to many rank-and-file Capitol police and others as sympatico with their generalized belief system, which of course contains unhealthy doses of racism as well as a melange of other reactionary ideological vices. The result was that a riot that could easily have been contained was not. This, too, serves specific interests.\n\nIt now suits a ruling order confronting a Trump who has clearly gone too far to designate January 6, 2021 an insurrection. Labelling the Capitol riot in this way makes it almost impossible for Trump to retain his hold on the entirety of the Republican Party, insures that there are amped up justifications for his displacement, and reinforces the likelihood that, his utility now exhausted, he can be marginalized, relegated to the chat rooms of the conspiracy-driven fringe right.\n\nTrump, of course, may well rise again, Phoenix-like, from the detritus of conflagrations of his own making. He has done this before. Nonetheless, it is entirely possible that his finest hour, if it can be described as such, has long passed. That said, we shouldn't be spreading his ashes just yet.\n\nThe sad and tragic reality is that it is our ashes that are being scattered. Caught in the vice grip of a pandemic and a ravaged economy, impaled on racial divides that seem too enduring, too wide, and too fraught to breach, the political tea leaves can only be read with difficulty, lost as they are in the dark swirl of events. The landscape of the future, to the extent that it can be glimpsed at all, looks barren and bleak. For whatever Trump's fate, Trumpism and worse is not going away.\n\nThe rise of the organized extreme right, from groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys to the Traditionalist Worker Party, Oath Keepers, and the Three Percenters, shows no sign of abating. Trump has legitimized such ugliness, and the Capitol riot will only further embolden militarized expressions of American fascism, racism, antisemitism, and the most extreme right-wing embrace of capital's ideology of acquisitive individualism.\n\nTo rely on the Democratic Party of Joe Biden to move us out of the current crisis is no less illusory than the irrational faith Trump's legions of combatants place in their chief. It is likely to end in the same disappointment, disillusionment, and despair.\n\nAs for the mainstream embrace of security forces and counterterrorism as the guardians of stability, let us not forget that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), established in 1938 on the eve of World War II to investigate disloyalty, subversive activities, and organizations with ostensible fascist or communist ties, spent an obligatory, metaphorical few hours addressing the far right, and then trained its sights, for decades, on the Left.\n\nThe Smith Act of the early 1940s set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the US government, and Communist leader Earl Browder provided the prosecution of the Minneapolis Teamsters' leaders and their Socialist Workers Party comrades with affidavits calling for the jailing of \"a Trotskyite Fifth Column.\" Less than a decade later, the Smith Act would be used to repeatedly bring to trial and sentence to jail over a hundred thirty communists, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Eugene Dennis, and Claudia Jones.\n\nThe FBI now tracking down as many of the Capitol rioters as it can identify has a long history of concentrating its fire power on the Left and giving the Right a pass. The Bureau had a less than exemplary record of taking on the White Citizens' Council and Klan members, some of whom were cops, who terrorized and killed civil rights campaigners and Congress of Racial Equality Freedom Riders like Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in Mississippi in 1963-64.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover was always more interested in Martin Luther King's and Bayard Rustin's sex lives, or Abbie Hoffman's and David Dellinger's so-called conspiracies, which the Bureau always linked to the ubiquitous threat of communism. This was more important than putting the likes of Byron De La Beckwith, well-known to have murdered Evers, in jail.\n\nIf the situation is now different in 2021, Trump has so hollowed out the \"security and intelligence\" apparatus of the state, which has been directed to concentrate its energies on foreign terrorists, that it remains to be seen just what will be done about right-wing extremists. A long history suggests that while the crisis of the moment dictates directing the state's security resources and personnel toward the Right, this focus will, inevitably, shift back to the Left.\n\nOne thing only is certain. Unless there is a substantive organized left response to the contemporary impasse in bourgeois politics - decidedly lacking in our present conjuncture - nothing good can come of where we are now. January 6, 2021 has made this clear, at the same time as it has given liberal emissaries privileged ground on which to make their stand in defense of capitalism and its ostensibly democratic order.\n\nBryan D.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe campaign to free Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar López Rivera, a political prisoner confined in a US federal penitentiary since 1981, has dominated various sectors of Puerto Rican activism for the last decade. The 34 Mujeres Por Oscar has been a fixture at Union Squre Park and other locations around New York for years, and when the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015, posters of Oscar festooned with a rainbow-pride flag around San Juan were ubiquitous.\n\nSo when President Obama announced on Tuesday that he was commuting López Rivera's sentence and permitting his release in May, it set off an outpouring of emotion on the island and the many urban centers where the diaspora lives.\n\nThe jubilation over López Rivera's commutation - not a pardon, but a curtailing of his sentence -  has cut across all political tendencies in Puerto Rico, from the socialist left to the Green-ish Independence Party to the centrist Popular Democratic Party to the increasingly hard-right Statehood Party.\n\nThe widespread support for someone like López Rivera, a former leader of the militant leftist group, the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN), is a reflection of the colonial yoke that Puerto Ricans have suffered under for centuries.\n\nThe roots of the FALN lie in the violently repressed nationalist movements in Puerto Rico in the 1930s and '40s led by the Harvard-educated Pedro Albizu Campos, who spent many years in prison for his role in fomenting uprisings and labor strikes across the island in protest of colonial rule. A 1954 attack on the House of Representatives in Washington resulted in the arrests and imprisonment of a group of four nationalists, including the legendary Lolita Lebrón.\n\nWhen the FALN burst onto the scene with a series of bombings of corporate buildings in 1974, one of its demands was for the release of Lebrón and her fellow prisoners. Yet the FALN also embodied a different kind of nationalist militancy, one forged by the experience of Puerto Rican migrants and their children, who grew up in cities like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia and were directly impacted by racism, segregation, and social injustice.\n\nLike the violent SDS offshoot the Weathermen, the FALN believed in armed confrontation with the US government and multinational corporations, and like the Irish Republican Army, it argued that its members had the right to militarily struggle for national sovereignty, distinguishing them from the nihilist pursuits of so-called \"terrorist\" groups. The FALN's first action - coordinated bombings of Exxon, Union Carbide, and Federal Reserve Bank buildings, among other targets - came the day before a pro-independence rally to be held at Madison Square Garden and three days before hearings about Puerto Rico's colonial status at the UN Special Committee on Decolonization.\n\nWhile the Puerto Rican Socialist Party initially objected to the FALN's use of violence, in the early 1980s Puerto Rican nationalist movements warmed to the idea that imprisoned FALN members were \"freedom fighters\" and \"patriots.\" Eventually, the group began to garner sympathy from the broader Puerto Rican community.\n\nLópez Rivera had joined the FALN after working as a community organizer in Chicago and serving in Vietnam. The latter has been cited as a key element in his radicalization. As the United States tried to inherit the burden and spoils of France's occupation of Southeast Asia, he witnessed firsthand the colonial racism at work and connected it to the what he viewed as the internal colonialism hindering Puerto Ricans, other Latino groups, Asians, and African Americans in the United States. Political radicals of color like López Rivera saw antiracist struggle as part of a global confrontation with class-based imperialism and colonialism. Linking up with the FALN was a logical, if not inevitable, next step.\n\nWhile López Rivera was never charged with or found guilty of direct involvement in any of the FALN's violent acts - which included various bombings, some lethal, in New York and Chicago - he was convicted in 1981 of seditious conspiracy (essentially a thought crime) and sentenced to fifty-five years. He's spent more than twelve of those years deprived of all human contact.\n\nIn 1999, López Rivera turned down a release deal from Bill Clinton, because a) it would have required him to serve an additional ten years and b) it would have left some of his fellow FALN prisoners languishing in prison. (Clinton's deal ultimately set free eleven of López Rivera's co-defendants.)\n\nFor the last twenty years, López Rivera and his remaining FALN comrades have renounced violence - a path borne out by other Puerto Rican militants like Dylcia Pagán and Elizam Escobar - making it easier to attract broad swaths of support from Puerto Ricans as well as high-profile supporters like Representative Luis Gutiérrez, Lin Manuel Miranda, San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, LGBTQ activist Pedro Julio Serrano, and rapper René Pérez Joglar (Residente).\n\nYet the deep support for López Rivera among mainstream Puerto Ricans is still notable. What does it mean that the average Puerto Rican sees the colonial reality as so unjust that they can embrace someone who once believed in violent confrontation? On some level, it has to mean understanding that despite the United States's purportedly anticolonial foundation, it has blatantly held and exploited an island as a de facto colony for over one hundred years, while artificially constructing its economy as a dry run for free-trade extraction of corporate profit long before NAFTA.\n\nIndeed, even as the island prepares a massive celebration for López Rivera's release, and Mayor Cruz offers López Rivera a job in the \"community,\" Puerto Rico faces harsh austerity measures courtesy of a fiscal oversight board whose imposition was signed, sealed, and delivered by Obama, the Senate Democratic majority, and Lin Manuel Miranda as the island's last, best hope to manage its $72 billion debt crisis.\n\nJust last week a labor reform law passed by the Puerto Rican House of Representatives, pushed by the newly installed statehood party, whose governor was among those calling for and celebrating López Rivera's release, proposed a series of changes that would reduce salary, benefits, and overtime pay for thousands of employees in an effort to show the board that it would play along with austerity.\n\nYesterday, as a crisis in health care funding looms - and doctors and specialists continue to leave the island - the employee union for one of the island's largest hospitals, Auxilio Mutuo, called a twenty-five-hour work stoppage. Meanwhile, Trump has named as one of his close economic advisers the billionaire hedge-fund owner John Paulson, a major player in Puerto Rico real estate, and the new governor Ricardo Rosselló has reached out to ex-Trump cohort Corey Lewandowski to lobby the incoming president on the debt crisis.\n\nDespite Oscar López and the FALN's flawed strategy of violent confrontation, the explosion of support for his release demonstrates his popular purchase as an anticolonial freedom fighter. As Puerto Rico faces down multiple crises, the island will need a considerable dose of that anticolonial spirit to win a measure of freedom and sovereignty.\n\nEd Morales is the author of Living in Spanglish , Latinx , and the forthcoming Fantasy Island: Colonialism, Exploitation, and the Betrayal of Puerto Rico .

Daniel Guarache / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor the corporate media, \"blue lives\" seem to matter in a lot of places. Just not in Venezuela.\n\nOn Wednesday, October 26, 2016, the Venezuelan opposition convened nationwide demonstrations against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, protesting the national electoral body's decision to temporarily suspend preparations for a presidential recall referendum pending investigations into fraud.\n\nAs was to be expected, international media lauded the protests, rejoicing at the idea that the Maduro \"regime\" was now in its death throes.\n\n\" Mass Protest in Venezuela Demanding End of 'Dictatorship' ,\" wrote the AP. \" In Venezuela, 'Maduro For Longer' Spells Trouble ,\" salivated Forbes .\n\n\"As the situation worsens, it is only logical that more Venezuelans will be driven by desperation to rise up. If there is more bloodshed, Mr. Maduro will be responsible,\" wrote the New York Times editorial board.\n\nYet strangely missing from the narrative of the Venezuelan opposition's peaceful march to victory over a cruel dictatorship was the small detail of the murder of a Venezuelan police officer by demonstrators Wednesday evening.\n\nMiranda state police officer Jose Alejandro Molina Ramirez was shot and killed while attempting to disperse a protest near the Pan-American Highway in the southeastern Caracas municipality of San Antonio. In a graphic video , Ramirez and other officers can be seen approaching a group of demonstrators when they suddenly come under gunfire from what appear to be the nearby buildings.\n\nWhile Venezuelan media reported the incident as a confrontation between police and opposition protesters, international media sought to separate the crime from the day's demonstrations.\n\nThe Guardian suggested that the Miranda state police \"did not link the incident to the opposition protest,\" yet offers no quote from the police department in question. A review of the local department's Twitter feed as well as local media accounts fails to uncover any such announcement. Nor does the newspaper bother to cite Interior Minister Nestor Reverol's official statement that the homicide occurred in the course of a law enforcement effort to disperse demonstrators.\n\nAlthough the New York Times and the Miami Herald indeed mention the killing in the context of the day's protests, both newspapers consider the episode sufficiently unimportant to merit no more than one sentence each.\n\nTo its credit, CNN does include the homicide in its headline, devoting one line to the incident before going on to cite \"opposition leader\" Henrique Capriles's unverified figures for the number of injured and imprisoned from the day's protests. Absent is any indication that Capriles is in fact governor of Miranda state and as such is responsible for the safety its police personnel.\n\nDespite being updated late Thursday afternoon, the CNN article likewise makes no mention of Venezuelan attorney general Luisa Ortega's official figures , which include eighty-six people injured nationwide, including twenty-six police and National Guard personnel.\n\nReuters, meanwhile, succeeds in suppressing any mention of the dead cop at all, preferring to highlight \"veteran activist Maria Corina Machado and jailed protest leader Leopoldo Lopez's wife Lilian Tintori\" who it said are urging \"Gandhi-style civil disobedience.\"\n\nThe irony that these far-right figures were key protagonists in 2014's violent antigovernment protests - which left forty-three dead, over half of whom were government supporters, police and National Guard troops, and passerby - is lost on the international news service.\n\nWhy does the mainstream media systematically under-report or outright ignore the Venezuelan right's almost nonstop violence against Venezuelan government personnel and institutions?\n\nBecause reporting incidents like the killing of Molina, the wounding of twenty-six other officers, attacks on socialist youth leaders in Cojedes or state cultural workers in Amazonas threaten to slaughter a sacred cow - namely the idea of a peaceful and democratic Venezuelan opposition.\n\nAfter all, it's difficult to argue that Venezuela is an \" all-out, no-more-elections dictatorship \" when you have an opposition that wins elections and holds regular, authorized protests where its activists frequently attack police, civil servants, and government supporters, often with complete impunity.\n\nIt's inconvenient to report these uncomfortable facts that show opposition leaders' utter disregard for the rule of law, which is normally considered a sacrilege by Western journalists.\n\nYet no one seems to care that Henrique Capriles has yet to issue a public statement condemning the homicide of a police officer in his state during a protest that he himself led. Contrast this with the media's eagerness to report Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick's comments blaming Black Lives Matter for the killing of Dallas police at a protest earlier this year.\n\nNor does the international media hesitate in calling hard-right opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez a \" political prisoner . \" Lopez - who previously played an active role in the 2002 US-backed coup for which he was granted amnesty - is currently serving a thirteen-year prison sentence for public incitement to violence and criminal conspiracy during 2014's antigovernment protests.\n\nIn the United States, he would likely be facing a much stiffer sentence or possibly life imprisonment for such offenses. Compare with Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Rivera López, who is currently serving a fifty-five-year sentence in US federal prison for seditious conspiracy despite the fact that \" he was not convicted of any violent crimes .\"\n\nSadly, the international media has a lot more tears to shed for Leopoldo Lopez than it does for the victims of opposition violence.\n\nIn most cases, \"blue lives\" apparently matter an awful lot - except when they're serving under a self-declared socialist national government that has been branded an \" unusual and extraordinary threat \" by the United States.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But even with a small, reactionary minority of support, Bolsonaro can wreak serious undemocratic havoc.\n\nSupporters of President Jair Bolsonaro gather during a demonstration in Sao Paulo, Brazil on September 7, 2021. (Cristina Szucinski / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nPro-Bolsonaro protests in Brazil this week that some feared would be the first act of a coup turned out to be nothing of the sort. Not only that, but the president's usual antidemocratic rhetoric could not mask the fact that his intended show of force was a bit of a flop. Yet the concerns over political violence in Brazil's future may still be well-founded.\n\nThe September 7 protests, held on the national holiday to celebrate Brazil's independence, were the most carefully organized and planned Bolsonarista demonstrations since his electoral victory in 2018. Bolsonaro had only a week prior declared that \"the Brazilian people will never have as big an opportunity as on September 7.\"\n\nBut Bolsonaro is increasingly encircled. The economy is in bad shape, and much of the country's political and economic elite have turned against him. Popular living standards are being squeezed as food and fuel inflation bite amid high unemployment; his poll numbers, in turn, have plummeted. Bolsonaro, his family, and his entourage are also the subject of numerous judicial probes, some of them criminal.\n\nBut it is this weakness, combined with a fervent hardcore base that includes military and police forces, that make many feel this is a volatile moment. What if Bolsonaro supporters were to storm the Supreme Court or Congress? What if the police forces mutiny? What will the military do?\n\nThough these questions still remain, and there is little indication that he would leave office peacefully should he lose the October 2022 election as predicted, his intransigence can't make up for a basic fact: things do not look promising for Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe lead-up to this week's demonstrations was discussed by local and especially international media as a possible repeat of the Capitol Hill riot in Washington, DC on January 6. Such comparisons are worse than useless. January 6 was never a real threat to democracy in the United States - but Bolsonaro could be.\n\nJanuary 6 has been much mythologized by those who stand to gain from talking up the Trumpian insurrectionist threat, like the Democratic establishment and the FBI . In fact, the latter found no evidence of a centrally planned plot, and there are no plans to charge those involved with seditious conspiracy. The Trumpists did not kill anyone, and the only violent death was a policeman shooting a pro-Trump protester at point-blank range. It was not a coup, nor even a respectable coup attempt. Instead, the whole administrative transition in the United States saw the great mass of the establishment upholding the election results. There was no risk of a military coup.\n\nIn Brazil, the situation is far more precarious. The elite has never been as wedded to institutionality as it is in the United States. After all, those elites backed Brazil's 1964 military coup, with many of its political henchmen still in Congress. From the institutional coup against President Dilma Roussef of 2016 onward, democracy has been weakened ever further.\n\nSince Bolsonaro took office, six thousand military personnel have come to occupy positions in the federal government, with the top brass strongly represented in the presidential cabinet. Up and down the country, military and police reservists have been elected to municipal, state, and federal offices. The risk of military and police forces lining up to launch a coup, with or in place of Bolsonaro, is worth seriously pondering.\n\nThe reality of the situation in Brazil, though, is that the conditions for a classic coup do not exist.\n\nUnlike in 1964, there is no credible reference in Brazil to a moral majority - civil society, the bourgeoisie, the military - holding off communist infiltrators. The elite do not have a motive for a clean break with constitutional norms (they are okay with a steady deterioration), Bolsonaro's relationship with the world's greatest imperial power is not strong (it took over a month for Bolsonaro to recognize Joe Biden's victory last year, and it's not clear that US interests would be better served by a dictatorship than what can be achieved under current arrangements), and the majority of Brazilian citizens don't support Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro instead speaks for an embattled minority. He claims that the establishment wants to bring back \"the bearded one,\" former president Lula da Silva.\n\nSo the political equation is radically different from the past. Bolsonaro isn't standing with the establishment and \"good citizens\" against a minority. Even according to his own rhetoric, he himself is in the minority, being threatened by the establishment.\n\nThis was visible in the composition of the crowds on September 7. His hardcore support is made up of sectoral interests (especially midsize and large agribusiness, and independent truckers), the forces of repression (military and police), and various ideologically motivated groups. The largest of the latter are evangelicals, though they hardly constitute a unified bloc.\n\nThe various other rightist groups - monarchists, integralists, and followers of philosopher Olavo de Carvalho - form the activist core of Bolsonaro's support. These may generate a lot of sound and fury on social media, but their ideas are not the basis on which Bolsonaro won the last election - and they won't be in 2022 either. They are lost-causers and no-hopers. In 2018, anti-Workers Party sentiment ( antipetismo ) and a general revolt against the political class were decisive, in a way they are unlikely to be in 2022.\n\nAccording to the latest polls, 64 percent of Brazilians reject Bolsonaro. If there were an election tomorrow, he would only garner 25 percent support in the first round, and little more in the second round - against 55 percent for Lula. Not only is Bolsonaro unpopular, he's unable to reach beyond his hardcore base, even in a face-off with Lula. The antipetismo that got him elected three years ago would not save him now.\n\nYet Bolsonaro continues to insist - as he did at a rally a week ago, repeated at this week's protests - that his endgame is \"prison, death, or victory,\" and that the electoral system is a \"farce.\"\n\nBolsonaro's career-long sequence of antidemocratic postures is well known. But this year has seen an intensification of his saber-rattling against liberal institutions, as his support has fallen from last year's highs, after the pandemic emergency support payments were terminated. Recently, his attacks have narrowed in on the voting system and the Supreme Court.\n\nBolsonaro is currently facing five different criminal investigations in the Supreme Court, two in the Superior Electoral Court, as well as over a hundred fifty separate impeachment motions in Congress. In March, Bolsonaro pressured the Brazilian Armed Forces to fly over the Supreme Court in Gripen fighter jets so as to cause a sonic boom that would blow out the building's windows. After refusing, the commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force all quit - an unprecedented moment in the nation's history. They were replaced by more amenable generals.\n\nIn April, a Senate hearings committee began investigating Bolsonaro's disastrous handling of the pandemic. Such hearings often cause more smoke than fire; this is set to be the case again, as members of Congress use it as a stage to grandstand on. With a compliant prosecutor general, Bolsonaro was never likely to face investigation - but for a while, it kept Bolsonaro in the headlines, as he was held responsible for corrupt vaccine purchases and non-purchases.\n\nAfter the Congressional recess over the winter months of June and July, Bolsonaro began pushing for Brazil's fully electronic voting system to be supplemented by paper ballots. Though the system has never been subject to any credible allegations of fraud, Bolsonaro has made it a central concern of his, claiming that the 2018 election - which he won - was already fraudulent, and insisting that the same would happen in 2022 were there not an auditable paper trail. The facts of the matter are irrelevant, of course, for the intention is to demoralize citizens and faith in democracy.\n\nOn the day of the floor vote in Congress on August 10, when it looked like Bolsonaro's paper ballot bill was heading to defeat, Bolsonaro ordered an impromptu parade of armored vehicles and tanks in Brasília in front of the Three Powers Square. Though widely mocked for featuring only forty old, decrepit vehicles - including tanks last seen used by American forces in Vietnam - the aim of intimidation was obvious.\n\nThe president then followed up four days later saying he would have two Supreme Court Justices, Alexandre de Moraes and Luís Roberto Barroso, impeached. On August 20, he made good on his threat to de Moraes. The Senate duly rejected the petition the following week.\n\nOver his term, Congressional figures and justices have shied away from confronting Bolsonaro directly, restricting themselves to outraged denunciations and an insistence on moderation - all to little effect. In past weeks, that has begun to change. Justice de Moraes issued restraining orders against Bolsonarista activists, preventing them from approaching the Three Powers Square in Brasília while also blocking bank accounts of far-right groups.\n\nMost recently, one of Brazil's eleven Supreme Court justices, Ricardo Lewandowski, published a piece in the newspaper of record, Folha de S. Paulo , warning that Bolsonaro must not \"cross the Rubicon\": the price to be paid for any violent intervention would be high.\n\nWhat was striking about the whole circus was how little it implicates the majority of Brazilians. It is a drama played out between conservative justices, a conservative Congress, a far-right president, the military leadership, and at most the activist core of the president's base in 25 percent of society. The general thrust of Bolsonaro's barbs has not been against \"communists,\" the Left, human rights, and so on, but against the other branches of government.\n\nWould the demonstrations change that? Just over a week ago, Bolsonaro held a rally with supporters in the provincial city of Uberlândia in the state of Minas Gerias, halfway between São Paulo and Brasília, and close to what could be seen as the epicenter of agribusiness interests, the last solid pillar of Bolsonaro's capitalist support. He told the crowd: \"I believe the time has come for us, on September 7, to become truly independent. And to say that we do not accept that one person or another in Brasília imposes their will. The will that matters is your [the crowd's] will.\"\n\nProtest organizers planned two big demonstrations: one in the capital of Brasília, one in São Paulo. They claimed that they were expecting two million at each. Bolsonaro was explicit about the photo op that it presented him with: he wanted to be pictured with millions of supporters.\n\nThe stage seemed set for a major confrontation. When police suddenly allowed protesters, including trucks and vans, into the esplanade near Congress the night before the demonstration - something that was meant to be prohibited - some feared the worst.\n\nIn the end, they achieved maybe 5 percent of the promised numbers, around a hundred thousand to a hundred fifty thousand in each city. This was despite a strategy aimed at concentrating supporters in two locations, rather than holding demonstrations in every state capital. Supporters were bussed in from around the country at huge expense, bankrolled by agribusiness.\n\nOn Brasília's massive open esplanade, the numbers looked disappointing. On São Paulo's six-lane Avenida Paulista, it appeared much denser. A crowd of over a hundred thousand protesters is not negligible. But it's far from millions.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Bolsonaro's base takes from this. Will they be energized or fall into recriminations for an underwhelming showing?\n\nAt both Brasília and São Paulo events, Bolsonaro gave similar speeches. His speeches concluded, \"we promise to respect our Constitution [but] whoever acts outside it should get in line, or ask to leave.\" He added that he would no longer respect any action taken by Justice de Moraes. Indeed, in São Paulo, denunciations of the latter drew the loudest cheers, and the majority of placards were directed against the Supreme Court, with only the minority concerned with \"communists\" or demanding military intervention.\n\nBolsonaro's eldest son, Flávio, a Senator, tweeted that their message \"has nothing to do with attacking the Supreme Court or Congress.\" It was all about defending the Constitution. He charged ten of the eleven Supreme Court justices with \"resolving internally\" the \"destabilising element\" - that is, Justice de Moraes, who is investigating the Bolsonaro clan in multiple probes.\n\nIn fact, the personalization of the attacks made the whole spectacle appear more about the president saving his own and his son's skin than a political program for implementing dictatorship.\n\nNone of this is to say Brazilian democracy is vibrant, nor that it necessarily has a long-term future. Bolsonaro's authoritarian restoration is further degrading an already fragile politics, while overseeing the destruction of state capacity and a fraying of society. Criminalization of opponents has become the main practice of politics, as Sabrina Fernandes has argued . Indeed, though the judiciary's retaliation against Bolsonaro may bring some relief that the institutions won't meekly accede to Bolsonaro's threats, it was the judiciary becoming a major player in the democratic game that got us into this mess.\n\nAnd yet the Left is drawn toward the passive insistence that institutions simply \"do their job\" - as in a recent manifesto signed by all the union confederations in the country, weakly declaring that \"the legislature and judiciary at all levels . . . must take the lead in important decisions on behalf of the democratic rule of law.\" This is of a piece with much of the Left's stance throughout Bolsonaro's term, offering little more than calling Bolsonaro a fascist and a genocidaire, and abstractly defending liberal institutions.\n\nMoreover, the Left has had little to say to the masses. The precipitous fall in living standards has given it a leverage point on which to attack Bolsonaro - now dubbed Bolsocaro (expensive Bolsonaro) - but there is little in the way of an alternative vision or mobilization of the working class.\n\nIn particular among Workers' Party supporters, the hope is that Lula will easily win the 2022 elections, bringing the good times back. But not only were the good times not that good, the conjuncture is now radically different, and the room for maneuver is significantly reduced.\n\nLula is hard at work building alliances with all and sundry, including the retrograde forces that trace their lineage back to the dictatorship and are keeping Bolsonaro in power, as well as seeking to appease the military that they do not stand to lose any privileges, real or symbolic, with him as president. Lula will owe a lot to many powerful figures and forces. Even if this strategy is electorally successful, it's hard to imagine Lula being in a position to radicalize once in power.\n\nAs for Bolsonaro, his strategy of provoking a reaction from institutions to force a confrontation may still continue. After all, since Bolsonaro took office, he has aimed to do little else than cause chaos; he rules through crisis, as he is unable to govern.\n\nIf he loses the next election, will he leave office? The joker in the pack is the Military Police . Already in the lead-up to yesterday's demonstrations, there were worries that the police might mutiny. Active police forces are prohibited by law from any political manifestation. They can vote, but taking part in a protest or lending it vocal support is strictly forbidden.\n\nIn past weeks, several reserve and retired military police commanders made statements in support of the protests and of Bolsonaro. One ex-police commander in São Paulo - who previously made headlines claiming policing had to be different in Jardins, a posh central São Paulo neighborhood, compared to the periphery - called on veteran police to show up on September 7. Various others posted on social media, calling people to the streets to defend Bolsonaro or to \"fight communism.\"\n\nOne, a reservist and state congressman, even called himself a miliciano bandeirante ( miliciano being a member of a criminal paramilitary gang with which Bolsonaro is imbricated, and bandeirante an early modern pioneer and enslaver of indigenous peoples). Most worryingly, an active police commander in the state of São Paulo in charge of five thousand troops called on his \"friends\" to be present at the demonstrations.\n\nThe obvious conclusion is that various police leaderships are willing to openly push antidemocratic ideas. One recent online poll carried out by the Atlas Inteligência institute, a big data agency, identified that 30 percent of police intended to go to the demonstration (versus 18 percent of general population). An earlier study had shown that 71 percent of police had voted for Bolsonaro and that 81 percent of those continued to support the president. The exact figures may not be totally reliable, but they show the direction of travel.\n\nWe will have to see if evidence of plainclothes police on the protests emerge in the coming days, but nothing yet indicates that they showed up en masse. Nevertheless, this is a serious concern that may well outlive Bolsonaro. After all, in early 2020, Military Police mutinied in the northeastern state of Ceará, which led to the shooting of a Senator . Despite a hundred thirty police having been accused - and police strikes being illegal - until today no one has been charged. We live in worry that such scenes will be repeated, at larger scale.\n\nAs for the military, it remains unclear where they stand. As Celso Rocha de Barros argued in Folha de S. Paulo in advance of the demonstrations, the protests were not likely to change matters much in this regard. Either the military has decided it does not want to rule directly, and Bolsonaro's show of force - such as it was - wouldn't change anything; or it has decided it does , which means the coup has already happened.\n\nThe fact may be that the military are burned from propping up Bolsonaro's government and that they are ultimately more concerned with guaranteeing their privileges and reputation. If Lula can guarantee that - and he's a proven himself a leader willing to make deals with former enemies - then why force a rupture with democracy?\n\nOnly during a situation of generalized disorder, in which police mutiny, might the military feel it is impossible not to step in. What happens then and how long might their \"intervention\" last is anyone's guess. But even then, this Bonapartist moment would likely be carried out in Bolsonaro's stead, rather than with him.\n\nOminously for Bolsonaro, impeachment has now started to look more likely. He has bought Congressional support by offering a morass of right-wing parties known as the Centrão offices and funds. He is in their pocket. But as markets become increasingly wary of political instability - and neoliberal reforms do not seem a presidential priority - there may be pressure on various center and right parties to get rid of him. In the few hours after the September 7 demonstrations, several such parties announced they were meeting to discuss impeachment.\n\nShould that go ahead, it would have the added benefit, in their eyes, of clearing the path for a \"third way\" candidate. Until now, no mainstream right candidate has managed to poll in double figures, with the electorate polarized between Bolsonaro and Lula. Getting Bolsonaro out of the game would open up space for a more traditional center-right figure to try to recapture voters that were lost to the far-right surge in 2018.\n\nSuch an eventuality would then expose a complacent left strategy that consists in simply waiting for Lula. Popular mobilization, not deference to compromised bourgeois institutions; and an alternative program, not denunciations, are still found wanting.\n\nAlex is a writer, researcher and translator based in São Paulo, Brazil.

But from military build-up to fantasies of mass deportation, right-wingers are promising their supporters better disasters: ones where they get to be in charge.\n\nBJP supporters celebrate after assembly election results on October 8, 2024, in New Delhi, India.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Carlos Mazón took power as head of a right-wing government in Valencia last year, it seemed the climate crisis was nothing to worry about. He had formed a coalition between his conservative Partido Popular and the far-right Vox - and in order to seal the deal, he agreed to scrap the Valencia Emergency Response Unit. Last month, Valencia was devastated by floods, with over two hundred people killed as warnings failed to go out and bosses refused to let workers go home to safety. Well into the crisis, Mazón was enjoying a long lunch .\n\nDespite these political responsibilities, following the disaster, the far right has attempted to capitalize. It blames Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and his broad-left government for destroying Franco-era dams that would have allegedly stopped the flash flooding. In reality, as El Diario reports , the vast majority of dams removed have been small weirs, less than two meters tall, and all were \"useless infrastructure.\" Franco's dams would have not saved the Valencian people. But for right-wingers who deny a real disaster and then invent fake ones, this hallucination is key to understanding the destruction in Spain.\n\nThis strain of right-wing thought is the subject of Richard Seymour's new book, Disaster Nationalism . In it, Seymour uses tools from psychoanalysis and Marxism to examine what is going on with the global far right. Olly Haynes interviewed him for Jacobin about his new work.\n\nCould you explain what disaster nationalism is, and why - as you put it - it is \"not yet fascism or not-yet-fascism\"?\n\nI noticed some years ago that the new far right was obsessed with fantasy scenarios of imaginary and extreme evil. FEMA death camps, \"great replacement theory,\" the \"Great Reset,\" fifteen-minute cities, 5G towers being beacons of mind control, and microchips installed in people through vaccines. In India, they have this theory called the Romeo jihad: that Muslim men are seducing Hindu girls and converting them to Islam, thus waging a sort of demographic war. Or take QAnon's fantasies of satanist, communist pedophiles running the world. They are really enthralled and obsessed by hallucinatory scenarios of extreme disaster.\n\nWhy is this? There's no shortage of real disasters: wildfires, floods, wars, recessions, and pandemics. Yet quite often they have denialist relationships with these disasters. Many say COVID-19 was just an excuse for the Fourth Reich, or that climate change is an excuse for a liberal totalitarian regime, a new form of communism, etc.\n\nRight-wingers are really enthralled and obsessed by hallucinatory scenarios of extreme disaster.\n\nI often take the example of the wildfires in Oregon. The fires ripped across the plains and through the forest and burned at 800 degrees Celsius. They were a real threat to people's lives. But a lot of people refused to leave because they heard that it was actually Antifa setting the blazes and that it was part of a seditious conspiracy to wipe out white conservative Christians. So, rather than flee for their lives, they set up armed checkpoints and pointed their guns at people, claiming that they were on the lookout for Antifa.\n\nWhy do they go for this mass apocalyptic fantasy? Because it processes disaster in a way that is actually quite enlivening. Most of the time, when people go through disasters, it results in depression and withdrawing a bit from life and the public sphere. But the far right offers you a different way out. It says \"those demons in your head that you've been wrestling with, they're actually real and you can kill them. The problem is not anything difficult, or abstract or systemic, it's just bad people, and we're going to get them.\" It takes all the difficult emotions that people deal with in the face of economic shocks and climate change and gives them an outlet that feels valid and validating.\n\nSo that's what I call disaster nationalism. It's not yet fascist because although it organizes people's desires and emotions in a very reactionary direction, they're not trying to overthrow parliamentary democracy, they're not trying to crush and extirpate every last human and civil right - yet. They also lack the organizational and ideological maturity. We're in a stage of accumulation of fascist force. When you go back to the interwar period, that accumulation process had already taken place, there had already been massive pogroms, there had been big far-right movements before fascism. And so, we are in an early stage of the inchoate fascism that I see developing here.\n\nAt the end of The Anatomy of Fascism , published in 2005, Robert Paxton warns that Israeli politics could descend into fascism. Where does Israel fit in your understanding of not-yet-fascism?\n\nWhen I started writing this book I didn't expect to say much about Israel. I thought it would fit in as a minor element in a global patchwork focusing on much bigger states. In the end, I had to write a whole new chapter because of the genocide in Gaza.\n\nIt's been clear for some time that Zionism is always incipiently genocidal because its ultimate desire is that Palestinians should not exist. And there has always been elements of Hebrew fascism going back to the 1920s. Their settler-colonial dynamic, I would argue, is quite distinctive. You don't see that in the United States: obviously, settler colonialism is a historical reality with ongoing reverberations, but it is not a live, present reality. Settler colonialism structures how the state is organized, it structures everyday life, you can't exist in Israel without being aware of the Palestinians and their recalcitrant, infuriating desire to exist.\n\nBut there are other aspects that are quite similar to patterns overseas in the US, Britain, India, Brazil, etc. These patterns are the decline of the postwar system, in their case a corporatist arrangement between Jewish labor, Jewish capital, and the state achieved on the back of ethnic cleansing in 1948. That broke down in the 1970s and like everywhere else, they went neoliberal. Israeli Labor declined. They tried to adapt through Third Way politics, their last hurrah was probably the Oslo process. Today, they barely exist.\n\nYou've had these tendencies toward increasing pessimism and class inequality, and the old nationalist utopia of the postwar world is gone. The capitalist class is cosmopolitan and closely integrated with Washington, it's not the Jewish-nationalist utopia they were trying to build. So, for some in the Zionist movement, there is an attempt to reconstitute that Jewish homeland, a Jewish safeguard if you like. The Right has said \"No, we're past that now. This is a situation in which we must settle the question with the Palestinians once and for all.\" To them that means expelling the Palestinians and decisively colonizing every bit of land that they believe belongs to the Greater Israel.\n\nDoes that bring us to fascism? Not so long as they have various constitutional, liberal-democratic systems. It is an exclusionary democracy, and it is not unusual in that respect; America until the 1970s was an exclusionary democracy, actually I would say it still is today, just to a different degree. Israel has an increasingly racist and authoritarian and genocidal culture and it's closer to a fascist coup d'état than anywhere else. I think the genocide and the radicalization process in the rank and file is going to be a process that leads to a Kahanist or far-right coup.\n\nIf you want to look at where fascism is quite advanced, I'd say it's there, but also in India. All the alarms are crying out, \"We're on the brink of a genocide here,\" where the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], a right-wing authoritarian movement linked to historical fascism, has colonized the state and suppressed civil rights. This is a global phenomenon in which Israel has a unique and distinctive role. It is quite close to a millenarian fascist regime. In the medium term, that's a live possibility and a dangerous one given that it's a nuclear state.\n\nYou write that \"it would be foolish to ignore rightist doom fantasies. They are often attuned to realities that liberal optimism prefers not to acknowledge.\" What realities are those?\n\nThey sometimes alight on quite important elements of reality. Take this stuff about fifteen-minute cities - it's hallucinatory and delusional in terms of its belief that it is foreshadowing some kind of communist anti-car dictatorship. But at its core is a real threat to automobility, to suburban lifestyle, and to the relative advantages of having a car. If you build cities around convenience and around having cycle lanes everywhere, getting rid of pollution as much as possible, and removing parking spaces, that's a problem if you're someone who thrives on getting around everywhere by car. It's particularly a problem if you start putting traffic barriers up to stop you driving down certain roads.\n\nIf you're directly, personally affected you might feel that life is going to change drastically in the next few decades. And they're not entirely wrong about that: climate change will necessitate vast structural changes. Liberals want to deny the severity of what's coming and of the things that people are going through already. I think the left-wing response should be to say, \"Yeah, you're right, we're going to utterly transform this thing, but it's going to be much better for you. Here's how.\"\n\nThe example that always comes to me is Barack Obama in 2016. He made fun of [Donald] Trump for catastrophizing in his campaign, and he said in his wry ironic way: \"The next day people opened up their windows, the birds were singing, the sun was shining.\" The pathos he was trying to invoke was that people are actually pretty happy, everything is OK. Then in the election he got his answer: Trump won. For a lot of people, things are not OK.\n\nTrump made his inaugural address with the speech written by [Steve] Bannon, talking about \"American carnage,\" which I think is a kind of reactionary poetry because carnage is not an inaccurate description of the destruction of industrial America. They alighted on a real problem, but their answer was to blame China, blame East Asia. Most of the jobs that were lost were lost through class struggle from above - downsizing, busting unions. There was an element of outsourcing, but the corporations are to blame not the workers in East Asia.\n\nSo, you see they can identify certain forms of disaster. What they can't do is integrate it into any kind of coherent, solvent global analysis. All they offer, really, are symptoms designed not to solve anything, but which allow you to go out and butcher Muslims in India, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, to kill Workers' Party supporters in Brazil, shoot, stab, or drive at Black Lives Matter [BLM] protesters in America, or have racist riots in Britain where they tried to burn asylum seekers in their hotels. This is what the Right offers as an alternative to disaster; better disasters, disaster in which you feel in charge.\n\nYou mentioned the killing of Muslims in India. Could you explain what the Gujarat pogrom was and why you take it as an inception point for the current wave of disaster nationalism?\n\nI would say it's the canary in the coal mine. Obviously, it's far from the only relevant pogrom in India. They have a kind of pogrom machine: Paul Brass writes about this elegantly. Essentially, there had been a fire on a train, which killed a number of Hindu pilgrims. These were members of the VHP, a far-right organization, and the assumption made by the Hindutva [Hindu-nationalist] movement was that Muslims had caused the fire with petrol bombs.\n\nThere is scant evidence for this: impartial inquiries found that the fire was an accident. But they decided that there had been a genocide against Hindus and in the days following they incited the population to take up weapons and to hunt down and kill and torture Muslims. Which they did, directly organized by BJP members, incited by BJP leaders, and with the collusion and participation of police and businessmen who paid off individuals to go and take part.\n\nIt was a collective outburst of coordinated public violence, a permissiveness with a degree of control from above. The result was that the BJP's vote went up by 5 percent when they had been expected to lose that state after having previously terribly mishandled a real disaster: an earthquake that had taken place the previous year.\n\nSo, you see the pattern here: there is a real disaster that affects people, the government handles it terribly, and then they instead offer a fake version of a disaster and they incite people to kill someone and it's very exciting. It's awful the things they do . They're murdering babies in front of their mothers; they're putting spikes between women's legs; they're cutting people in two with swords.\n\nObviously that had been building up for some time, and then Narendra Modi in the months after is doing these Hindu pride rallies and he's telling people if we can restore pride in our Hindu people then all the \" Alis, Malis, and Jamalis \" will not be able to do us any harm - by which he obviously means the Muslim population who had just been through a pogrom. The fact that this was not discrediting but in fact electrified the BJP base and made Modi into a sex symbol for the first time, tells you something about this kind of politics.\n\nWe've seen that again and again. Without all the armed, anti-lockdown protests and violence against BLM protesters you wouldn't have seen the bungled insurrection on January 6. Same thing in Brazil: Jair Bolsonaro was 20 points behind, he almost won in 2022 and got more votes than he did in 2018. How did he do that? A summer of chaotic violence in which he went around saying leftists should be machine gunned, and his supporters were either flashing their guns at Workers' Party supporters or assaulting or murdering them. I'm not saying the Gujarat pogrom causally precipitated this other stuff, but it was an early example of where this was coming from, and as soon as Modi got elected in 2014 it showed that liberal capitalism would tolerate this.\n\nMuch of the genocidal violence committed since the 1990s has been against Muslims of various ethnicities, and although there is plenty of racism against different groups in Western politics, the most vociferous attacks seem to be reserved for Muslims.\n\nTommy Robinson, for example, brags that black people are welcome to attend his rallies. What role does the abstracted figure of \"the Muslim\" play in disaster nationalist discourse and has it displaced \"the Jew\" as the far-right hate figure?\n\nI don't think you would find that so much in Brazil or the Philippines. But you do find it for a whole constellation of states from India to Israel to the US and most of Western Europe, actually Eastern Europe, too. It's not exactly the same thing in semiotic terms as the figure of \"the Jew\" because at the moment there is no sense in far-right discourse that Muslims, in addition to being the kind of wretched-of-the-Earth lumpen mass, are also in control of everything.\n\nThere have been attempts to develop a kind of conspiracy theory like that of Bat Ye'or's Eurabia theory , for example. But most of the time it's not the belief that Muslims are secretly in charge and running the financial system, but rather that they are a subversive, violent, abnormal, and inferior mass of people that needs to be subject to violence and borders to keep them under control.\n\nThat originates, I would say, with the 1980s turn toward ethnic absolutism, the coalition between Likudniks in Israel and Christian fundamentalists in America, toward a kind of identity absolutist politics where everybody has to be fitted into a particular box - there's a kind of breakdown of the kind of unifying anti-racist solidarity that we saw during the Cold War era, in Britain taking the form of political blackness. That all broke down, and then you have the Rushdie Affair and Muslims categorized specifically as a problem.\n\nIt's important that this is rooted in the daily experience of capitalist life. So in Britain, for example, people had been part of the same trade union in Northern cities or docklands, once those industries were shut down and the unions broken, they often went off into segregated areas of the economy and found that their housing was still segregated and the school system effectively segregated and that local councils were practicing policies of segregation and policing was segregationist in that sense, it was very racist. Couple that with austerity and there's public squalor, nobody has anything, and you always blame the people down the road: \"They get everything, I get nothing.\" That's when you start to see riots in Northern cities and then the war on terror catalyzes all of that.\n\nSo, it's a global thing in which liberal civilization defined itself against \"bad Muslims.\" Initially there was this idea that the problem was \"not all Muslims, just what we're calling Islamic fascism\": George W. Bush made this point. But the way this was understood popularly and the way this was politicized extended it to all Muslims. So, the Muslim is a central figure, but I think we need to see it as part of a chain of equivalence with the \"transgender bathroom predator,\" the \"cultural Marxist,\" and the migrant. In the Philippines, the major category is the drug addict: those are the people who have been murdered. It can take various accents, but I will agree that globally, and particularly for the West, \"the Muslim\" coordinates all these other problems.\n\nOne of the most interesting chapters is on the role of sex in disaster nationalist discourse. You also wrote a chapter on the genocide in Gaza, though with slightly less emphasis on the psychoanalysis that you use in other chapters.\n\nIssues of sexual exploitation and sexual assault have recurred throughout the genocide in Gaza, between Israeli soldiers posting TikToks with Palestinian women's underwear or the riots in defense of soldiers accused of raping detainees in prison. Could you expand on your analysis of the role of sex in the disaster nationalist imagination?\n\nI would say that just in terms of the libidinal economy of this new far right, their underlying premise seems to be that someone always gets violated and the problem is that \"communists\" (by which they mean Kamala Harris, etc.) want the wrong people to be violated. The incel movement, the men's rights advocates, etc. often try to justify rape. There is a kind of contradiction in this libidinal economy between renewed severe prohibitions - no more gay marriage, no more transgender, wives back in the kitchens, trad-wife fetishism - on the one hand, and on the other, total predatory freedom for males, selective permissiveness. It's unsurprising that you see that in war zones. Wars generally see a lot of rape: the victimization of the enemy particularly involves the brutalization of women.\n\nI was recently researching perpetrators, particularly relating to the genocide in Gaza and one of the things that comes up is what Klaus Theweleit talks about, which is the idea of the dangerous woman. In modern terms this is the social-justice warrior, shrieking with red hair, etc., but in the time that he was writing about, the Freikorps movement of the 1920s, the dangerous woman was a communist who had a gun up her skirt. She's someone that you want to get close enough to kill. That dangerous proximity is enthralling because you get close to the danger then you overcome and you take what you want, in the worst way possible.\n\nI would guess that a lot of male right-wing politics today is an attempt to overcome a feeling of inefficacy, helplessness, paralysis, and so on. And frankly when they talk about rape, the implication is they are really horny and desire a lot. But the evidence suggests that young men, young people in general, are not as interested in sex as previous generations. They're not as interested in sex, they're not as interested in romance, there's nothing very sexy about contemporary life.\n\nOne of the things here is that they are blaming women for the fact that they don't desire, and they're saying, \"We're involuntarily celibate.\" They say if women were coming on to them, they would be up for having sex all the time. I doubt that. They are as troubled, as thwarted, and fucked up as everybody else - more so. But I think they're trying to reinflate their desire by turning it into a demonstration of power, of efficacy, of potency. There's a lot of that going on, and I think there will be specificities in Gaza, because the whole business about Israeli soldiers filming themselves in the stolen lingerie of Palestinian women, it's obviously parodic, it's genocidal, but there's something about that which implies an unconscious identification with the victim.\n\nSomething I thought was missing from the book was an analysis of the role of liberal centrists in enabling this. Kamala Harris campaigning with the Cheneys and then losing to Donald Trump comes to mind. It is there in the background, but I was wondering if you could explain how you see the liberals fitting into this picture?\n\nThere's two angles on this question. Liberal centrists as individuals and as a group and their symbiotic relationship with the far right, the second is liberal civilization. The second is my focus in the book, on the failures of liberal civilization. The barbarism inherent in it as manifested in imperialism and war, in its racism, its border sadism, in work and exploitation, but also in class hierarchies and the miseries that that creates. So then the question is how we get to specific situations in which people like Obama, Hillary Clinton, and now Kamala Harris and Joe Biden actually help midwife this new formation into power.\n\nI would say that there's an interesting question that philosopher Tad DeLay poses in his amazing recent book, The Future of Denial about climate politics, where he asks, \"What does the liberal want?\" It's a good question because liberals repeatedly proclaim their affinity with egalitarian and libertarian values. They claim to support action to tackle climate change but also oppose any effective means of doing so. Increasingly I think that when push comes to shove, liberals do not want liberalism. Obviously, certain distinctions have to be made because there are liberals who are genuinely philosophically and politically committed to liberal values and will fight for them and will go Left if they have to. But there's also the kind of hard centrists whose politics is organized principally around a phobia of the Left.\n\nHere, I talk about hallucinatory anti-communism, mainly in connection with the Right, but liberals have just as unrealistic a sense of the Left and its supposed threat. It would be nice if the Left was stronger and we were about to bring about a communist revolution, but that's not the case. But when Bernie Sanders was running, I remember the panic from American liberals. There was a broadcaster who was concerned that once the socialists took power, people would be up against the wall and shot. Then also consider how the hard center (center-left and center-right) has promoted conspiracy theories like, for example, in Britain, Operation Trojan Horse: the idea that Muslims were taking over Birmingham schools. That didn't come from the far right but from the government.\n\nThis is the relationship: the far right takes the predicates that have already been set up by the liberal center and radicalizes them and makes them more internally coherent. Some years ago, early on when New Labour was in power, they started having a real crackdown on asylum seekers. They would regularly stage news shots and angles where a minister would be down at Dover looking for asylum seekers in people's vans and stuff like that. When all that was going on the British National Party (BNP) was growing and in interviews they said, \"We love what they're doing, they're legitimizing us.\" They took concerns that were at the bottom of people's agenda in 1997 and they were pushing them right to the top, and that was giving the BNP legitimacy.\n\nFor their own reasons, they tend to amplify reactionary currents that were already circulating. Then when the far right grows off the back of that, they then tend to argue that \"that's a good reason for us to go further in this direction because that shows that if we don't tackle this issue the far right is going to grow even more.\" It's a resonance machine, they sort of bounce off one another. So, one of the problems between having to choose between a centrist Democrat and a far-right Republican is that that choice is predicated on the exclusion of the Left. Structurally both thrive on that, but also the beneficiary in the long term is the far right.\n\nToward the end of the book, you suggest that appeals to people's rationality and self-interest don't always work, and that bread-and-butter politics, while necessary, might not be enough: that to mobilize people politically you need to arouse people's passions. Do you have any idea what these \"roses\" that need to be offered alongside the \"bread\" need to look like?\n\nI should have used that metaphor in the book: \"bread and roses\" is a good way to put it. I think there is a legitimate, innate striving toward transcendence that is immanent to life as such. In other words, to be alive is to be striving toward ever another situation. Life is a teleological process where we are striving toward a certain developmental peak. But also, striving toward knowledge, striving toward the other - that's the social instinct, striving toward, in Plato's language, the good, the true, and the beautiful. I think that's in everyone and in every living thing.\n\nI would say that you can see this when we have these left-wing ruptures, like for example the Sanders campaign. It's all very well to talk about bread and butter. There were good things in there that people need like health care and a higher minimum wage, tackling exploitative employers, also beyond that tackling border sadism saying to people you want to live in a decent society.\n\nAnyone with any decent instinct was drawn to that campaign, electrified by it, because ultimately what did he say? He didn't say vote for me and you'll have more material goods, he said vote for me and you'll have a political revolution. And don't just vote for me, be in a political movement with me, take power, overturn all the decrepit, sadistic elements in our society, and deepen democracy. He talked about an improbable journey together, of remaking and transforming the country.\n\nPeople do really have that longing to work together to achieve something higher. One of the pathologies of modern life is that people feel frustrated, paralyzed, inefficacious. His characteristic mode of address was \"if we stand together\" - and when he said that the crowd would erupt. That's just one example of a left-wing rupture, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has his own style, Jeremy Corbyn had a very different style, but it always had the same basic idea: the social ethos, striving together.\n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels talked about this dialectic where you join a union initially for something like higher wages, a shorter working day, things that you basically need, but then you develop other, richer needs. Quite often workers will go on strike to defend their union even if they'll lose wages and their objective material conditions will get a bit worse. They need one another, they need their union. It can go further; it can be politicized in a much deeper way. The most radical need is the need for universality, in a Marxist sense.\n\nWhen people glue themselves to the street to stop climate change, they have in mind living in a world of plenitude, not necessarily one where they have all the gadgets and commodities that they need, but where everybody and every species has a chance to thrive and flourish. That's a normal thing, I would say. The question is how that instinctive baseline communism, as David Graeber puts it, is thwarted, crushed, and diverted. How is that impeccably respectable need neglected and pathologized, so people don't dare even think it, let alone express it? So that people adopt a kind of cynical posture.\n\nI think that the roses we need are the ones that come from our togetherness: I mentioned the Platonic terms the good, the true, and the beautiful. Think about culture and that work we do together, think about the search for truth in sciences and that work we do together. Our efforts to raise moral standards by trying to stop violence, stop rape, and end racism are intrinsic capacities that we all have. It's a given that we also fall short, that we can live privative existences where we are selfish and hateful and resentful. But that's not all there is to it. If it was, we might as well give up.\n\nRichard Seymour is the author of several books, including Corbyn: The Strange Rebirth of Radical Politics .

Many have been convicted of felonies and begun their prison sentences.\n\nBut seditious conspiracy trials are qualitatively different kinds of cases - and when there are convictions in such cases, they matter. NBC News reported this morning:\n\nFour members of the far-right Proud Boys organization were found guilty Thursday of seditious conspiracy in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Enrique Tarrio, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Dominic Pezzola and Zachary Rehl each faced nine counts. All but Pezzola were found guilty on the rare charge of seditious conspiracy under a Civil War-era statute. Tarrio, Biggs, Nordean and Rehl were also found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing for context that the proceedings are not yet fully complete: Jurors are apparently still split on the seditious conspiracy charge against Pezzola - the judge in the case has asked them to keep deliberating - though the defendant has been found guilty of other crimes related to Jan. 6.\n\nPart of what makes these developments striking is how unusual they are. Sedition charges are rarely brought - in part because they're hard to prove, and in part because Americans rarely try to overthrow their own government. With this in mind, by most measures, the sedition trials in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack are the most notable since the aftermath of World War II .\n\nIt means today's convictions are important, not just as a matter of accountability, but also in their historical weight.\n\nAs the political world takes stock of the jury's findings, let's also not forget that in the not-too-distant past, some on the right saw the lack of sedition charges as proof that the Jan. 6 violence was not an actual insurrection. Fox News' Brit Hume, for example, argued via Twitter early last year, \"Here's a thought. Let's base our view on whether 1/6 was an 'insurrection' on whether those arrested are charged with insurrection. So far, none has been.\"\n\nAs a Washington Post analysis explained, Hume had plenty of company. A year ago, then-Fox host Tucker Carlson added, \"Oh, it was an 'insurrection.' So how many of the participants in that insurrection had been charged with insurrecting? With sedition? With treason? Zero.\" Fox's Mark Levin also told the network's audience, \"Has anybody been charged with sedition? Nobody. Has anybody been charged with treason? Nobody. So why do they keep calling it an insurrection?\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just Fox: Jon Chait found all kinds of voices on the right making the same pitch , seemingly confident that there'd be no seditious conspiracy convictions.\n\nThat, of course, was before members of the Oath Keepers group and members of the Proud Boys were found guilty .\n\nBy this reasoning, I suppose there should be widely held assumptions, across the left, right, and center, that the convictions necessarily offer proof that Jan. 6 was an insurrection?\n\nAs for a certain former president who lit the match that burned on Jan. 6, none of these developments do him any favors.\n\nDennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor, wrote for MSNBC this morning, \"The convictions add to the former president's legal woes. Recall the first presidential debate in 2020, when [Donald] Trump famously told the Proud Boys to ' stand back and stand by .' The effect of that callout to the militants became visible to the nation on Jan. 6, and again to the jury here. At trial, the government introduced a message from one Proud Boy who wrote right after the debate that 'Donald has given us a command.' Prosecutors also introduced the group's messages suggesting that some coordination with the White House may have occurred before Jan. 6.\"\n\nTrump is currently facing a federal criminal investigation related to his role in the Capitol attack. It's a safe bet that the Republican's defense attorneys were watching the Proud Boys' trial with great interest.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "The leader of the Oath Keepers may have just doomed himself\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nAfter several weeks, the first seditious conspiracy case federal prosecutors have brought in a decade will soon be in the hands of the jury. Five members of the Oath Keepers organization are charged with seditious conspiracy and several other felonies , all centering around the group's efforts to violently interfere in the Jan. 6, 2021, congressional certification of Joe Biden's election win. Although the government's evidence is strong, the case is not without its challenges. But the decision of the lead defendant and founder of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, to testify in his own defense may actually have made the prosecution's case even stronger.\n\nThe FBI investigation produced several thousand written communications among the organization's members before, during and after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. These messages - texts, emails, Signal group chats, Facebook posts, etc. - can be an evidentiary bonanza, but they also present significant tactical challenges for the government. Prosecutors can't just hand the jury a thousand written messages to read during deliberations. They must decide which messages are of sufficient evidentiary value to present to the jury. Then, each message must be introduced into evidence and read to the jury, generally during the testimony of an FBI agent.\n\nGiven this mountain of communications, the prosecutors did a fairly good job of keeping the testimony moving and the jurors engaged. Still, having sat through the testimony, I can attest that it was an unavoidably tedious process for everyone in the courtroom.\n\nEven more compelling were the multiple exhibits of video and audio recordings. During testimony from U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, jurors saw video footage of several Oath Keepers who had unlawfully entered the Capitol standing within arm's reach of Dunn as he guarded the entrance to a stairwell that led to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. As he faced off with the crowd, he yelled at them, \"We have dozens of officers down, we're taking them out on stretchers, you all are f---ing us up!\" As they approached, Dunn stood firm and told them, \"I'm not letting you come this way.\" And they didn't. Harry Dunn, as but one man, held that line. His testimony reinforces the fact that we have heroic public servants among us.\n\nNot only did video capture the Oath Keepers moving in a military stack formation through the crowd before entering the Capitol, but some of the defendants were caught uttering deeply incriminating statements. One, Jessica Watkins, bragged that \"we stormed the Capitol, pushed our way into the Senate and the House.\" Another, Kelly Meggs, admitted to \"looking for Pelosi\" in the Capitol. Caldwell is caught saying, \"Let's take the damn Capitol. Let's storm the place and hang the traitors.\"\n\nBut the prosecution is not without its challenges, as can be seen from the testimony of a former Oath Keeper named Graydon Young. Last year, Young pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of Congress and agreed to testify against the defendants. Young went to the Capitol on Jan. 6 believing he was going to be \"part of something historic.\" He said the Oath Keepers' goal was to \"make contact with and disrupt Congress where they were meeting.\" After the attack, he posted on Facebook that \"we stormed and got inside.\"\n\nBut when defense attorneys cross-examined Young, he admitted that there \"was no express agreement to attack the Capitol.\" Moreover, he conceded that neither Rhodes nor other Oath Keepers ever expressly said the plan or goal was to stop Congress from certifying the election results. On re-direct examination by the prosecutors, Young did affirm that there \"was an implied agreement to stop the certification.\" But in order to convict someone of any conspiracy, the prosecutors must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that two or more people agreed to commit a crime and then at least one member of the conspiracy took one step toward the commission of that crime - what the law refers to as an overt act. So when one of the conspirators testifies that here was no express agreement, it gives the defense attorneys substantial ammunition for their closing arguments.\n\nBut the defense team likely wasn't so pleased with another dramatic moment, when Rhodes took the stand to testify in his own defense. In my 30 years as a prosecutor, I can attest to the fact that defendants rarely take the stand at trial. Defense attorneys generally are content to rely on the high burden of proof to convict - beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant has no burden of proof at trial and need not present any evidence whatsoever. But when a defendant chooses to testify, it's often the highlight of the trial.\n\nOf course, in the hands of a prosecutor who is a skilled cross-examiner, a defendant's decision to testify can hurt more than help his cause. When questioned by his attorney on direct examination, Rhodes tried to convince the jury that there was no plan to attack the Capitol or otherwise stop the certification. Rhodes said the Oath Keepers came to Washington simply to serve as a security detail.\n\nOnce Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy cross-examined Rhodes, though, his credibility disintegrated. It quickly became clear that she knew the answer to every question she asked, and had hard evidence ready to confront Rhodes if he lied. For example, Rhodes maintained that he never directed, urged or encouraged the Oath Keepers to engage in violence on Jan. 6. Rakoczy then walked Rhodes, and the jury, through some of his written communications to his subordinates, instructing them to \"get squared away and ready to fight,\" \"the final defense is us and our rifles,\" \"we're not getting out of this without a fight,\" and an ominous choice: \"conquer or die.\"\n\nIn response to Rhodes's contention that the Oath Keepers were not intending to impede the work of Congress but were merely standing by in case Trump invoked the Insurrection Act, Rakoczy reminded him of his own written missive: \"He (Trump) needs to know that if he fails to act, we will. We will have no choice.\"\n\nAnd if there was ever any doubt regarding Rhodes's true intentions, it was dispelled when the jury heard Rhodes own voice on a covert audio recording saying, \"My only regret is we didn't bring rifles (to the Capitol). We could have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang f---ing Pelosi from the lamppost.\"\n\nNo trial is a sure winner, but as the Oath Keepers trial hits into the home stretch, it seems like the jury has been given ample evidence of guilt. And the defendants have nobody but themselves to blame.\n\nGlenn Kirschner, a former assistant U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., is an NBC News and MSNBC legal analyst.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The Oath Keepers founder is the first Jan. 6 defendant sentenced for that serious charge , and it's the longest prison term yet in the Justice Department's sprawling probe into the Capitol attack. It's worth pausing on the solemn moment stemming from the violent attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Rhodes to 18 years, telling the 58-year-old that he presents an \"ongoing threat\" to the country .\n\nSeeking a 25-year term, federal prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum that Rhodes \"proposed that he and other Oath Keepers members and affiliates forcibly oppose the lawful transfer\" of presidential power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Prosecutors wrote that Rhodes \"pushed the idea among Oath Keepers members and others that with a large enough mob, they could intimidate Congress and its Members and impose the conspirators' will rather than the American people's: to stop the certification of the next President of the United States.\"\n\nRhodes' lengthy federal sentence could serve as an uncomfortable reminder for Trump, who has expressed sympathy for people with Jan. 6-related convictions and has said he would pardon them if he becomes president again. In addition to being investigated in Georgia and federally by a Justice Department special counsel, the Republican former president and 2024 presidential candidate already has an ongoing criminal prosecution in New York state court on charges that he falsified business records, with a trial set for March 2024.\n\nBut while every criminal case is serious, and the New York case involves an alleged cover-up of hush money payments to help Trump win the 2016 election that put him in office to begin with, those 34 New York charges are low-level felonies and carry relatively little to no prison time.\n\nIf federal charges are added to Trump's docket, his prison outlook could change drastically.\n\nJordan Rubin is the Deadline: Legal Blog writer.

Here is a closer look.\n\nIt is essentially the incitement of violent action against the government - some kind of communication or activity aimed at getting people to overthrow the state by force or to prevent it from carrying out its authority to enforce the law.\n\nIt is a federal crime found in Section 2384 of Title 18 of the United States code. That law makes it a crime for two or more people to actively plot to overthrow by force the federal government, to levy war against it, to unlawfully seize federal property or \"by force to prevent, hinder or delay the execution of any law of the United States.\" A conviction carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nIn the Oath Keepers case, prosecutors marshaled text messages, videos and other evidence to argue that Mr. Rhodes and other militia members had agreed to take steps to block Congress from certifying Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s Electoral College victory, a crucial step in the constitutional system for the normal transfer of power. Mr. Rhodes received 18 years in prison, and one of his top deputies was sentenced to a 12-year term.\n\nWhile they clearly overlap, \"sedition\" centers more on plotting and incitement, whereas \"insurrection\" is generally understood to mean the actual violent acts of an uprising aimed at overthrowing the government.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump in power through an extensive plot that started after the 2020 election and culminated in the mob attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe jury in Federal District Court in Washington found three other defendants in the case not guilty of sedition and acquitted Mr. Rhodes of two separate conspiracy charges.\n\nThe split verdicts, coming after three days of deliberations, were a landmark - if not total - victory for the Justice Department, which poured enormous effort into prosecuting Mr. Rhodes and his four co-defendants.\n\nThe sedition convictions marked the first time in nearly 20 trials related to the Capitol attack that a jury had decided that the violence that erupted on Jan. 6, 2021, was the product of an organized conspiracy.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is the most serious charge brought so far in any of the 900 criminal cases stemming from the vast investigation of the Capitol attack, an inquiry that could still result in scores, if not hundreds, of additional arrests. Mr. Rhodes, 57, was also found guilty of obstructing the certification of the election during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 and of destroying evidence in the case.

Trump in power after his election defeat by leading a violent mob in attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe fifth defendant in the case, Dominic Pezzola, was found not guilty on the sedition charges, although he was convicted of other serious felonies.\n\nThe verdicts, coming after seven days of deliberations in Federal District Court in Washington, were a major blow against one of the country's most notorious far-right groups and another milestone in the Justice Department's vast investigation of the Capitol attack.\n\nThe trial was the last of three sedition cases that federal prosecutors had brought against key figures in the Capitol attack.\n\nThe sedition charge, which is rarely used and harks back to the Union's efforts to protect the federal government against secessionist rebels during the Civil War, was also used in two separate trials against nine members of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia. Six of those defendants - including Stewart Rhodes , the organization's founder and leader - were convicted of sedition; each of the others was found guilty of different serious felonies.\n\nAs the verdicts were read in the fourth-floor courtroom, Mr. Tarrio, Mr. Pezzola and the other defendants - Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl - remained steely. With the exception of Mr. Pezzola, the men were also found guilty of conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election, which took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6. All five defendants were convicted of a third conspiracy count as well, which accused them of interfering with the duties of members of Congress that day.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And that has left them vulnerable to second-guessing by the courts on how they have pursued criminal cases both against the rioters and against former President Donald J. Trump, and contributing to a long series of challenges and delays.\n\nThe court's new ruling on the obstruction law will hardly cripple the Justice Department's ability to go after the rioters, but it will constrain prosecutors by restricting the use of an important tool they have relied on to seek accountability against the most disruptive members of the mob.\n\nWithin weeks of the Capitol being breached, Michael Sherwin, then the top federal prosecutor in Washington, promised to wage a campaign of \"shock and awe\" against the rioters who had attacked the building.\n\nEven though Mr. Sherwin said that sedition charges might be filed at some point against some of the defendants, his prosecutors ended up leaning much more heavily on the obstruction statute to go after those who they believed had committed the central crime that day: interfering with the certification of the election, which was taking place at a joint session of Congress.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Trump Pardons That Will Haunt America\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed dozens of executive orders that sought to reach into nearly every corner of America life. Yet that was overshadowed by Trump's unprecedented, sweeping pardons and commutations for nearly all of the roughly 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Among those pardoned were high-profile figures convicted of seditious conspiracy and violent assaults that left dozens of police officers injured. Though Trump had promised the move, its broad scope reportedly surprised even members of his inner circle. Just days before being sworn in as vice president, J.D. Vance told reporters that the most violent perpetrators \"obviously\" shouldn't be pardoned.\n\nTo help understand the true scope of Trump's action, on Tuesday I spoke with Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and co-author of God, Guns, and Sedition: Far-Right Terrorism in America . Ware's work examines the deep roots of far-right extremism and the importance of the sedition charges that followed Jan. 6 in sending a message of accountability in America . Now, with Trump's pardons reversing much of that, I asked Ware how he sees this moment. He had a simple response: \"We're in unprecedented territory.\" Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nAymann Ismail: What was your gut reaction to the news of the pardons?\n\nJacob Ware: This is pretty devastating moment for counterterrorism in the U.S., particularly counterterrorism against domestic paramilitary groups. It sets a terrible precedent for rule of law, for violence against institutions, violence against law enforcement. And it sends a message of permission-that political violence will be tolerated as long as it's on behalf of a certain movement and a certain man. And that's tremendously dangerous. We're in unprecedented territory where people who sought to overthrow the government have now been allowed back on our streets as returning warriors.\n\nWhat worries you most about Trump's action?\n\nJan. 6 was the largest investigation in Department of Justice history. Those prosecutions were really about two things: punishments of crimes committed and deterring follow-on acts of violence. The consensus among the counterterrorism community is that the deterrence has been completely and fully eroded now.\n\nIt's not just because of the pardons. In the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6, even the most conservative Republicans were horrified. Elise Stefanik called for people to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Over the course of the past four years, that narrative has been steadily eroded as Jan. 6 defendants have been recast and redefined from insurrectionists to martyrs, political prisoners, victims, hostages. At one point, President Trump even used the word \"warriors,\" a word that actually celebrates organized state violence. And so the concern is there is now no deterrence against political violence from this particular movement.\n\nWhat was the anticipation in the online extremism world heading into the Trump inauguration? What is the reaction to these broad pardons?\n\nWe know that countless individuals who are enmeshed in these criminal cases were trying to delay or postpone trials, waiting for Trump's inauguration, truly believing that he was going to protect them from the criminal justice system. This has been an ongoing dance that we've seen over the course of the past eight years, where President Trump would issue these public proclamations of support condoning these movements. We saw that at Charlottesville, and with the Proud Boys \"stand back and stand by\" comment. And we know from statements that these groups make from the chatter within their online spaces that they do take his words and his actions to be supportive of them. It was barely months between \"stand back and stand by\" and the Jan. 6 insurrection. So they were waiting for this moment, and they will be celebrating their freedom.\n\nI should also point out that Jan. 6 was an incident that had a huge variety of activity. You did have people who were involved in nonviolent crimes, trespassing crimes, and they served very short prison sentences, if they served prison sentences at all. And then you had people prosecuted for very violent crimes, including seditious conspiracy, which is arguably the most serious crime in our country. I think even the most conservative Republicans did not expect President Trump to pardon or commute the sentences of those prosecuted for seditious conspiracy. So that is also a big shock. The people the Justice Department proved had intended to overthrow the government have now been protected and condoned by President Trump. That is a big deal.\n\nAs the people convicted of Jan. 6 crimes start getting out of prison, what will you be watching? Do you think most of them will try to fade into ordinary life, or is there a chance they will jump back into organizing or activism?\n\nYou have two kinds of Jan. 6 defendants. You have those who recognize that they were duped and are genuinely remorseful. Those are the kind of people who I hope will be given the space to rebuild their lives. You also have those who acted out on Jan. 6 because they had a grievance against the government. And that victimhood has now been propelled further. They feel they now have more evidence that they are struggling against a tyrannical government. Certainly, I would expect those people to double down in their activism and go back to their paramilitary and militia groups as battle-hardened leaders who now can speak with authority about the violence against the government that they've been promising all these years. I do think this will be a shot in the arm for the movement and for several groups who had been relatively dormant since Jan. 6.\n\nSince President Trump first emerged on the political stage, he has redefined what we once called anti-government extremism. These kinds of movements-the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, and the Proud Boys-used to be fundamentally opposed to all governments or federal authority in the United States. That has changed now. They've been recast as anti-Democratic and pro-Republican, because they feel that President Trump is an ally in the White House. Because President Trump has shifted the Overton window, whether we see those people enter the political process or continue in their violent activism remains to be seen.\n\nI would also not be surprised to see some people use that to propel political careers as well. The narrative has been rewritten. Jan. 6 perpetrators are no longer violent insurrectionists. They are now peaceful patriots who were victimized by the government. And that is going to be something very powerful for people who decide to run for office, much as it was an honorable thing to have been a prisoner of war.\n\nWhat about the Proud Boys specifically? What do you think Enrique Tarrio's release could mean for the group's future?\n\nEnrique Tarrio has a long, checkered history of cooperation , which of course is not looked upon very positively by the movement. He's going back with this sense of legitimacy and authority because he is somebody who has personal experience of \"government tyranny\" in quotation marks; he stared down an overreaching tyrannical government and won. I think that's going to be an incredibly powerful narrative that he's going to be able to spin, which can make him a very powerful figure in whatever the next generation of the violent far right is. This pardon will be taken as a stamp of approval by the movement, and he's going to become a poster child for it.\n\nThe violent far right has always been exceptional at weaving this narrative of martyrdom and hailing those people who have been felled at the hands of the government as martyrs. And these people will now carry that authority with them forever. Whether Tarrio determines that he's going to go deeper into the movement and rebuild it for this golden age in the second Trump administration, or whether he decides to do something more productive with his life, it remains to be seen.\n\nHas anything of this scale happened before?\n\nI'm thinking a lot about historical parallels. In 1988, the U.S. government tried 14 white supremacists for seditious conspiracy at Fort Smith, Arkansas. And those 14 white supremacists were acquitted. It was a huge deal for the movement because they felt they had approval. But one of them, a former KKK leader called Louis Beam, realized that the entire movement had almost been decapitated. So, he went underground, formed this journal called the Seditionists, in reference to the charges, and he revived an old treatise of insurgency and guerrilla warfare known as leaderless resistance, basically lone-actor terrorism. And most of the violence that we've seen from the far right over the past decade-in places like Charleston, Pittsburgh, El Paso, Buffalo-have actually followed this model.\n\nI don't know whether the movement is going to say Jan. 6 was proof of concept for leaderless resistance, because when they organized publicly, the government was able to decapitate the movement temporarily, or whether they see that as a success now that they have infiltrated the mainstream. I can see it going either way. I think certainly we will see both groups and individuals acting with more of a sense of invincibility because they attacked the United States government.\n\nHow does this moment stack up against other pivotal points in your work studying domestic extremism?\n\nWe're in unprecedented territory. The success of the seditious conspiracy charges a couple of years ago was a really important moment because the government had made up for the mistakes that they made in 1988. For the first time, arguably since the Civil War, the United States government had proven without question that groups that organize against the government on behalf of white supremacist and anti-government ideologies were attempting to overthrow the government. And that was a significant deal, not just legally, but also in terms of deterrence and building a democratic norm against violence. All of that has now been destroyed.\n\nIt is fundamentally a rewriting of the norm against violence in democracies. That will affect our own battle here against domestic terrorism, but I think it also has implications abroad. Right now, in Washington, D.C., our national security bureaucracy is obsessed with great power competition, obsessed with strategic competition against China and Russia, and our allies and adversaries are watching crucial democratic norms be undermined in the alleged city on a hill, the United States. And that has impacts abroad. In fact, we saw that in Brazil in January 2023 when an election riot struck that capital city. It's not just an unprecedented impact for our own battle against domestic terrorism, but it also deeply affects American soft power and American foreign policy at a critical moment. I really think this is a transformational day for American national security and American counterterrorism, if not for American democracy writ large.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Yes, Donald Trump Is at Significant Risk of Federal Prosecution\n\nJust one week after the Jan. 6 House Select committee wrapped up a set of summer hearings that exposed Donald Trump's deep culpability for the events of Jan. 6, things have started to look much worse for the former president. On top of the Congressional inquiry, the start of the week brought fresh reporting that a federal grand jury is accelerating its probe into Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times broke a story disclosing important emails and admissions about the scheme to submit \"fake electors\" to Congress that the 2020 Trump campaign, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, and their lawyer-friends ran in six battleground states (plus New Mexico) after losing the election. Not to be outdone, the Washington Post published a scoop a few hours later confirming that the Department of Justice has turned to directly investigating Trump's actions.\n\nThe Post reports that the scope of the grand jury inquiry includes the fake electors scheme, Trump's direct involvement in it, and his efforts to press Vice President Mike Pence to utilize those phony certificates as part of a plan to overturn the election. The publication also noted that there was a parallel track to the investigation \"that could ultimately lead to additional scrutiny of Trump.\" That track would expand on the seditious conspiracy and conspiracy to obstruct a government proceeding probe that has already resulted in indictments against the leader of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. According to the Post, investigators are now not just looking at \"individuals who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6,\" but also scrutinizing those who \"were allegedly involved in planning the day's events.\"\n\nThe Post's confirmation matters, even though, to quote a line from Hamlet, \"There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave to tell us this.\" It has been obvious, and we have said so in Slate for many months, that Donald Trump is at significant risk of federal prosecution-as he should be, given the evidence now in the public record.\n\nThe latest revelations about the fake electors go to the scheme that appears to be at the core of the federal inquiry. The aim of the plot was to create a false conflict between competing electoral slates in the key battleground states in question. The apparent goal was to provide a pretext for Vice President Pence or Congress to reject or delay its Jan. 6 electoral certification of President Joe Biden's election.\n\nThe new evidence that seems liable to land people in the pokey involved emails from Jack Wilenchik, an Arizona lawyer, who was evidently part of the scheme. According to the Times, Wilenchik actually used the words \"fake electoral votes\" and \"fake\" votes in a December 2020 emailed message to Boris Epshteyn.\n\nEpshteyn, a long-time Trump ally, was strategic adviser to the 2020 campaign who allegedly coordinated the bogus slate plot for the campaign. The Times reported that he was a go-between for Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\n\nWilenchik wrote Epshteyn: \"We would just be sending in 'fake' electoral votes to Pence so that 'someone' in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the 'fake' votes should be counted.\"\n\nThen, trained lawyer that Wilenchik was, he soon attempted to correct course in a follow-up email-though not particularly successfully. He wrote that \"'alternative' votes is probably a better term than 'fake' votes,\" inserting a smiley face for good measure. Unfortunately for Mr. Wilenchek, an emoji defense would not hold up in court here.\n\nFurther digging the hole, Wilenchik said the votes in the fake electors plot \"aren't legal,\" writing: \"[The] idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren't legal under federal law-because they're not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6 th .\"\n\nWe suspect that DOJ prosecutors already have all of these emails. But if not, they surely laughed out loud when they read the New York Times on Tuesday. It's hard to find better evidence that someone participated in a scheme he knew was \"fake\" with electors whose votes \"aren't legal\" than having that person write it down, and then memorialize his realization, on the record, that he should stop making a record of this knowledge.\n\nThat's what prosecutors call evidence of \"consciousness of guilt.\" It can be quite helpful in proving an accused person's criminal knowledge and intent, a necessary element for conviction.\n\nWhile Trump did not send or receive these documents, from a culpability perspective, he did not need to. To establish guilt for a conspiracy, one needn't show every member's criminal intent or knowledge as to every part of the scheme. In fact, the Jan. 6 Committee has introduced startling evidence that Trump was behind the plot, including the testimony of Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and others revealing Trump's direct efforts to recruit potential false electors.\n\nWhich brings us to the most probable potential crimes: Conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstructing an official proceeding in Congress, including using the phony certificates. A federal judge found that Trump and Eastman likely committed these crimes even before the Jan. 6 hearings, and the evidence for that only deepened during those proceedings.\n\nConvicting a defendant of conspiring to defraud the United States requires proof of an agreement to participate in a deceptive scheme to deprive the government of its lawful functions-such a scheme is one with false or dishonest means and an intent to deceive. \"Fake electors\" that have not been certified according to a state's procedures, \"aren't legal,\" and that are without a certified vote count supporting them would qualify as deceptive means.\n\nIn this case, the evidence for proving the crime of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding would overlap with the above elements. The requirement in such cases to show that the defendant obstructed the proceeding \"corruptly,\" meanwhile, calls for identical proof of a purpose to act improperly and wrongfully.\n\nThat's where a key development from earlier in the week (that the Post also relied upon for its blockbuster) fits in. ABC News reported that Pence's former top aides, chief of staff Marc Short and counsel Greg Jacob, both testified before the Justice Department's grand jury looking into the efforts to promulgate a \"quiet\" coup without violence on Jan. 6.\n\nShort testified to the Jan. 6 committee that Pence repeatedly told Trump that the vice president could not lawfully reject or delay the Jan. 6 Congressional certification of Biden's victory.\n\nLike Short, Jacob was part of a January 4, 2020, White House meeting between Trump, Pence, and Eastman in which Eastman tried unsuccessfully to persuade Pence and Jacob to go along with Trump's scheme. Jacob testified that in the meeting, under questioning, Eastman acknowledged that his proposal violated the Electoral Count Act.\n\nTrump was present to hear that admission. Knowing that his own lawyer believed the scheme unlawful would be powerful evidence of his corrupt intent were the case to reach Trump. This is especially true given that Trump continued to pursue the scheme by egging on his riotous followers inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 when he tweeted , \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has recently redoubled the resources devoted to the Jan. 6 investigation. That-plus the rest of the day's breaking news-signals that Garland meant exactly what he said on Tuesday when NBC's Lester Holt asked him about prosecuting the former president: \"We intend to hold everyone, anyone who was criminally responsible for the events surrounding January sixth, for any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another, accountable. That's what we do.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Surprise Ruling That Tosses a Grenade Into the Jan. 6 Prosecutions\n\nJames Little invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump. He later pleaded guilty but remains unrepentant, insisting that he engaged in a \"patriotic\" protest that was hijacked by antifa, Black Lives Matter, and Capitol Police as part of a \"setup\" to entrap Trump supporters. In light of his criminal conduct and ongoing lack of remorse, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Little to 60 days in prison and three years of probation. He appealed, asserting that this penalty was illegal. On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed by a 2-1 vote , vacating his sentence.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit's decision is, on its face, a win for Little and others like him. It throws a surprise wrench into the Department of Justice's prosecution strategy for low-level rioters while stripping judges of the ability to impose a stint behind bars followed by long-term supervision. But the decision, if upheld, may prove to be a Pyrrhic victory for some number of Jan. 6 defendants whom it ostensibly benefits. That's because, by abolishing the flexibility of a split sentence, it may well lead to more prison time rather than less-the opposite of what Little and his fellow rioters seek. Still, the decision could be a disaster for the DOJ, which relied on the split-sentence possibility when making many decisions to offer plea deals to the people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. If those sentences are now overturned, dozens-maybe hundreds-of Jan. 6 rioters will essentially be let off the hook for their crimes.\n\nLittle is just one of an estimated more than 2,000 people who broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6; like him, every individual who entered the building without permission violated federal law. So far, the DOJ says, it has made more than 1,106 arrests. The precise offenses of each defendant, however, vary in severity, a fact reflected in charges brought by the department. Some, like the Proud Boys, plotted and led the attack, which resulted in convictions for seditious conspiracy. Others helped to physically breach the Capitol or assault its law enforcement officers , which led to serious felony charges. But a large number of rioters obstructed the counting of electoral votes by invading and remaining in the building without engaging in overt acts of violence or vandalism.\n\nThe DOJ charged many of these individuals with unlawfully parading or demonstrating in the Capitol, a so-called petty offense. Federal judges have frequently sentenced these rioters to a split sentence of prison and probation-typically, a short term of incarceration followed by a lengthier term of probation. The AP estimates that more than 80 rioters, about 12 percent of all Jan. 6 defendants so far, received a split sentence for this crime, with more in the pipeline. Judges favor this sentence because it imposes brief, direct punishment (prison time) as well as a longer, less intrusive restriction on liberty (probation), reducing the odds that a defendant will participate in another riot or other political violence. Most judges on the federal district court in D.C. have concluded that federal law permits this sentence; the only other court to consider the issue, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4 th Circuit, declared that such a sentence is \"unquestionably\" permitted .\n\nIt was startling, then, when a D.C. Circuit panel overturned this reading of the law on Friday. The majority opinion, written by Judge Justin Walker (a Trump appointee) and joined by Judith Rogers (a Bill Clinton appointee), is tough to follow and harder to swallow. It revolves around the federal statute that limits probation to certain defendants. (Most defendants receive \"supervised release\" rather than probation, though the difference is not relevant here.) The statute says a defendant can be sentenced to probation unless he \"is sentenced at the same time to a term of imprisonment for the same or a different offense that is not a petty offense.\" Those last six words are key: They tell courts, as a rule, not to impose probation if a defendant has been sentenced to prison-but that this rule does not apply to petty offenses. Walker resisted this conclusion by detaching the word same from the remainder of the sentence. Under his reading, a court may impose prison and probation for two different petty offenses, but not for \"the same\" petty offense. That's a real problem for federal prosecutors, who have relied extensively on plea deals featuring the single count of unlawful demonstration in the Capitol. At least 967 defendants have been charged with entering or remaining on restricted Capitol grounds, though many of those cases include other counts as well.\n\nAs Judge Robert Wilkins, a Barack Obama appointee, noted in dissent, the majority's interpretation overrides \"the natural and common reading of the statutory text.\" The statute tells courts that they need not \"choose either punishment or rehabilitation for petty offenses\"; they can impose both through \"a short prison sentence\" plus probation. Walker's reading, Wilkins wrote, compels judges to violate \"a bedrock mandate\" of sentencing law, creating an inexplicable incongruity that contradicts Congress' clear intent.\n\nThe only remotely plausible justification for this departure from the text would be an application of the \" rule of lenity ,\" which holds that an ambiguous criminal law should be interpreted in favor of leniency. That may be the case for Little, who already served his 60-day sentence and will now ask Lamberth to end his probation. For other defendants, though, the decision will not lead to more lenient outcomes. That's because judges-unable to tack on probation to a short prison stint-may instead opt for lengthier prison sentences. (Lamberth, like his colleagues on the D.C. district court, has been vocal about the need for prison time to drive home a lesson about the consequences of political violence.) In Little's case, that would have been six months in prison rather than 60 days.\n\nMoreover, the DOJ is not going offer any more single-count, split-sentence plea agreements; it now has every incentive to insist upon two or more counts to preserve the option of prison and probation. Prosecutors will, as a result, be far less likely to settle for a plea deal with the lone count of unlawful demonstration in the Capitol. They have a much greater incentive to secure at least two counts so judges can impose probation atop prison time. And multiple counts, of course, empower judges to hand down longer sentences.\n\nIt's possible that the full D.C. Circuit could reverse Walker's decision if asked to rule en banc, though that's not at all inevitable. Rogers is an idiosyncratic jurist, but she does lean left, and the D.C. Circuit's other liberals may take her vote to mean that the majority position has merit. If the full court fails to act, the Supreme Court might decide to wade into the morass of Jan. 6 sentencing-or dodge the issue, forcing the DOJ to accept defeat and refine its strategy. That will translate into stricter plea deals with multiple counts and, quite possibly, lengthier prison sentences for low-level rioters. Which means that despite Little's ostensible victory, the biggest losers here may be the Jan. 6 defendants themselves.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Proud Boys Are Only Getting More Powerful\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nEarlier this week, the Jan. 6 select committee built this case. They pointed out a tweet that Donald Trump sent out in the middle of the night on Dec. 19. And this tweet, the committee said, was a bat signal for organized extremists all over the country. The tweet talked about a big protest in D.C. on Jan. 6 and ended with a flourish: \"Be there, will be wild!\" Committee member Jamie Raskin said that the tweet \"electrified and galvanized ... dangerous extremists-the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, and other racist and white nationalist groups spoiling for a fight with the government.\"\n\nThe committee mapped out how this one message pinged around the internet. Testimony from an anonymous source inside Twitter itself explained how they watched Twitter users light up at the invitation to come to D.C. Then this enthusiasm on Twitter jumped to Reddit and YouTube. \"Not only did that Dec. 19 tweet whip all of the far right up into a frenzy about Jan. 6 specifically, but that immediately put them into a mode where they were planning for their last stand for their president, who, by the way, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers see as their boss,\" says Andy Campbell, a senior editor at HuffPost and author of the upcoming book We Are Proud Boys .\n\nCampbell has been thinking about the implications of that Dec. 19 tweet for months now. He's come to see this group as totally enmeshed in the events of Jan. 6. After all, a Proud Boy was one of the first people to breach the Capitol, smashing a window with a stolen police shield. \"The Proud Boys didn't just have an outsized role on the day, but they may have been the architects,\" Campbell says.\n\nHe's followed along as the government builds a criminal case against the Proud Boys. Federal prosecutors are charging some members with seditious conspiracy. The Department of Justice has even alleged some Proud Boys had a document with them, laying out what kind of chants to start on the day of the riot and whose congressional offices to occupy. But Campbell doesn't see this as the end of the Proud Boys: \"Since Jan. 6, we've only seen them ramp up their violent events. They're everywhere, every single weekend. In fact, with Trump out of office and with Jan. 6 behind us, extremist groups are completely untethered by Trump as their leader and are instead latching on to all sorts of Republican grievances.\"\n\nOn Thursday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Campbell about why for groups like the Proud Boys, Jan. 6 wasn't the end, it was the beginning. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: You've been covering the Proud Boys since their inception in 2016 , when you would notice them at Trump rallies. The Proud Boys stood out because they looked paramilitary. And they weren't shy.\n\nAndy Campbell: These guys dressed in makeshift body armor and makeshift weaponry and uniforms, showing up to Trump rallies. And these guys wanted you to know who they were. They wanted to be lionized for the acts of violence they committed, and they wanted to talk to the press. They were like, Yeah, here's my name. Tell everyone what I did because I'm a badass.\n\nWhat do you mean? What were they bragging to you about?\n\nOne of the Proud Boys facing seditious conspiracy charges, Ethan Nordean, punched a guy unconscious in 2018, and it was caught on video. Alex Jones called it \"the Punch Heard Around the World.\" Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, called Ethan Nordean their greatest achievement. He was given a nickname, Rufio Panman, a reference to the leader of the Lost Boys in the movie Hook, and now that punch and that video of him committing an act of political violence is in every Proud Boys sizzle reel on the internet.\n\nIn the early coverage of the Proud Boys, there was a desire to see them as silly. They would get together for drinks, and there was this kind of element of violence. But then they had an oath that you would take, and they were doing wacky stuff. You kind of get to there when you say one of them got a nickname from Peter Pan. Do you think that was intentional as a way to sort of confuse people?\n\nYou hit the nail right on the head. The Proud Boys were formed on the online talk show of Gavin McInnes, the co-founder of Vice Media. This guy is a just abhorrent, racist misogynist.\n\nAnd he made a name for himself by packaging misogyny and racism and bigotry into cool stuff for hipsters .\n\nHe had a Brooklyn beard is what I remember.\n\nOh, yeah. He maintains the hipster aesthetic: He's got the Wayfarer glasses, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and suspenders. He's constantly got this tongue-in-cheek attitude. But what he's saying is, Get out there, commit violence for the cause-the cause being Trump and the GOP. And he is very serious when he's telling his audience to go out there and commit violence. So the Proud Boys, they are trained very well by Gavin McInnes to slather everything they do in irony and in nonseriousness so that when the dust settles they can say one of two things. What we were doing was defending ourselves; this is political demonstration. Or, none of this matters; the fact that we were calling for violence before the violence happened, we were just joking, yadda, yadda. And it's completely snowed over members of the media and the government. An outgoing Homeland Security officer told the Times after Jan. 6 that they thought the Proud Boys were just a drinking club that gets in fights from time to time. And that is exactly the line that Gavin McInnes and the Proud Boys want you to think.\n\nI first started thinking about former President Trump's connections with the Proud Boys a little before the 2020 election. This is that debate Trump was in with President Biden , and he was asked to condemn white nationalist groups. He picked out the Proud Boys and it was the first time to me that I was like, Oh, there's a connection here, you know?\n\nAnd that is a testament to two things. One, Trump really, really loves people that love him. And the Proud Boys have very publicly and very violently shown time and time again that they are out there for Trump. In fact, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen said prior to Jan. 6 that between that debate and Jan. 6, Trump knew exactly who they were and that he knew exactly what he was saying when he said, \"Stand back and stand by.\" He was giving them marching orders. Now, whether or not you believe that Trump was giving them marching orders or that Trump can't put a sentence together, so he's not really responsible for that moment, it doesn't matter, because immediately following that statement, the Proud Boys started prepping for civil war.\n\nHow?\n\nAcross the country, they were watching TV. I spoke to Enrique Tarrio, the former chairman of the Proud Boys who is now facing seditious conspiracy charges for Jan. 6, and he said that that he had never gotten so many calls for recruitment, had never seen so much money rolling in until that moment. For the extremists of the world, this was like, oh, my God, the Proud Boys are top dogs. These guys have it.\n\nThe select committee talked about this moment this week, and they talked about it not from the perspective of the proud boys or the president or anyone else. They talked about it from the perspective of Twitter because they had someone testify from Twitter -this person was anonymous and their voice was disguised, so we don't know their gender or who they really are. But this person told the committee that this debate moment was kind of an earthquake on the platform. And it was a moment where Twitter considered having stricter content moderation policy because they could see how engaged people got right after the president called out the Proud Boys directly.\n\nAs reporters covering this beat, we have told people time and time again that there is a direct line between Trump's rhetoric and the political violence happening out in the street.\n\nTrump says something and points at someone, and that person or that thing gets attacked. This has been happening over and over. I'm old enough to remember when Trump called a number of top Democrats and reporters the enemy of the people, and then bombs started showing up at their houses. And this moment at the House committee hearing showed that the platforms which were boosting Trump's speech knew that, and they were amplifying it.\n\nThe connections the Proud Boys forged with Trump World ran deep. That was obvious when the Jan. 6 select committee shared a video of Trump adviser Roger Stone reciting the Proud Boys' \"fraternal creed\"-saying \"I'm a Western Chauvinist. And I refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.\"\n\nIn the months since Jan. 6, the connections between the Proud Boys and the GOP have only gotten stronger. It's a little like the group has metastasized.\n\nPeople are always surprised to learn this, but the Proud Boys are embraced and supported and very close to the full gamut of GOP elites next to Trump. After Jan. 6, Ann Coulter writes blog titled \" Thank God for the Proud Boys \" and reveals that she's been using them as her security for events for years. Roger Stone used them as his security for four years. And by the time Jan. 6 rolls around, he was in a mass text with the leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, Enrique Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes.\n\nWas the level of organization before Jan. 6 a surprise to you?\n\nWhen it happened, we saw that things were going to be bad because we saw these guys getting crazy about Jan. 6 prior to it happening. We saw them gathering their resources. And we were concerned because this is what the Proud Boys do. And if they do one thing well, it's coalition build. They're able to bring all sorts of extremist factions together under one banner, so that's very concerning. But even I didn't think that they were capable of being the full architects and the planners of a storming of the Capitol by thousands of people.\n\nThey were creating maps of the Capitol and pinpointing locations of police in anticipation of Jan. 6, right?\n\nRight, and a year after Jan. 6, we learned through evidence that that Enrique had a plan in his hands to storm various buildings on Jan. 6. And that was absolutely wild to me. The Proud Boys have begun to show themselves as not a bumbling, drunken fraternity, but an actual terrorist group. Their leadership has been jailed time and time again over the years for various assault crimes. And every time, their chapters continue to work as normal. They were built to have some sense of autonomy.\n\nIt sounds like cells.\n\nAbsolutely. And these cells are very easy to put together and very easy to deny their existence because all it takes to join one of them is to join their Telegram group and or Facebook group.\n\nCan you explain a little bit the ways that the Proud Boys have begun making themselves essential to the mainstream GOP? I've read a little bit about what the Proud Boys are doing in Florida, in particular, which I find interesting because it's not traditional running for office. Instead, it's pulling the levers of power from inside the local Republican Party. Can you explain?\n\nMiami is one of the seats of power for the Proud Boys in general, because it's where Enrique Tarrio is from and it's where he met, at a party, Roger Stone. So Miami was a natural place for the Proud Boys to insert themselves into real politics. And so they have a number of people who have taken seats at the Republican Party of Miami-Dade County.\n\nThey're in the executive committee right?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nSo they get to make the party platform.\n\nAnd they already have. Republicans on that committee were questioned about it, and they say, \"Hey, we've got a lot of characters here. This is an American thing where you have a big difference of different voices.\"\n\nWe have a big tent.\n\nRight, big tent. And that speaks to how the Republican Party today, they are big tent. And it's the reason why at what should be regular conservative political events like MAGA rallies, you'll see a neo-Nazi standing by a woman who could be your aunt, and they're protesting together.\n\nYou said this interesting thing, which is that no matter what happens now. The Proud Boys have a legacy at this moment because they've created a playbook. I wonder if you see evidence of that out there-of other people looking to them and saying, \"Oh, they did something interesting here.\"\n\nAbsolutely. You have members of other extremist groups using the Proud Boys playbook by showing up to different civic events, committing violence, and then declaring that they are doing this under the auspices of constitutionally protected demonstration.\n\nAnd we know that this works because a lot of people forget that the organizer of Unite the Right, Jason Kessler, is a member of the Proud Boys. But you don't often think of the Proud Boys when you think of Unite the Right, despite many members being there, and that's because they were able to lower their involvement after the fact and present themselves to the GOP, not as Nazis, but as a political force.\n\nThe Proud Boys playbook shows how you can go from bumbling street gang to a legitimate political force by gaining these relationships within politics and in by positioning your yourself as something other than an extremist gang.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Criminal Charges Will the Pro-Trump Rioters Face?\n\nMany Americans watching in horror Wednesday as pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol noticed that in all the footage of clashes and violence in Washington, there were very few arrests. The U.S. Capitol Police, somehow unprepared to handle the mass of protesters, focused on managing the crowds and pushing rioters from the building. As of Wednesday night, reports indicated that D.C. police had arrested 13 people, and Capitol Police had not said if it made any additional arrests.\n\nBut a wave of arrests will likely follow. There are hours of footage and countless dramatic photos revealing the faces of the often maskless rioters breaching the Capitol, seizing property, lounging in legislators' offices, and parading through the halls. There's likely also security and body camera footage. And it won't be too hard for prosecutors to identify those involved.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThere are a number of misdemeanor and felony charges that could be levied against the rioters. According to Channing Phillips, who served as acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia from 2015 to 2017, some of the local and federal charges prosecutors might consider include felony destruction of government property, weapons-related offenses, assault, and rioting. These could carry simply fines-or years in prison. In some cases, it will be hard to tell what laws rioters might have broken beyond minor offenses, such as failing to leave the Capitol grounds when ordered by police.\n\nThose who breached the Capitol itself are likely to face more severe charges, as are those who assaulted police officers. Alex Little, a former assistant U.S. attorney, said he expects that prosecutors might hit several insurrectionists with unlawful entry and destruction of property misdemeanor charges as a placeholder \"to get folks into the system\" while they sort out if they should face more serious penalties.\n\nWhen the authorities begin to piece together those who led the charge into the Capitol or most directly incited violence, they can turn to even more serious charges. According to Matt Jones, a former assistant U.S. attorney for D.C., it's unlikely prosecutors would treat this case like a typical protest, which might result in charges like trespassing or disrupting congressional operations. \"What we're seeing there is far different,\" he said. \"These are grave threats to our democratic institutions.\" Jones said that there are a number of serious federal criminal laws that would likely apply-and a few others that are almost never invoked, such as those against seditious conspiracy.\n\nSeditious conspiracy applies when multiple people \"conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or ... oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof.\" The charge can come with 20 years in prison.\n\n\"This was an effort, it appears, to undermine the lawful functioning of fundamental processes of our democracy,\" Jones said. \"I'm sure the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia is going to be dusting off those law books and looking through the statutes that are sufficient to fit the seriousness of the crimes here.\"\n\nAccording to Carissa Byrne Hessick, a criminal law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, prosecutors might also consider federal terrorism charges. And any other criminal charges committed during an act of terrorism would then come with a \"big bump-up\" in their sentencing. \"Because people were targeting the federal government, that's going to multiply the punishment well beyond if someone targeted a CVS or something or were stealing sneakers in a riot.\" As a result, she said, \"I think a lot of people went to D.C. not appreciating the sorts of crimes they could be charged with and the penalties they could be facing. ... The target of the violence was the U.S. government itself. And so that changes things and brings a whole new category of laws into play.\"\n\nIt is up to the attorney general and the U.S. attorney in D.C. to decide how these cases will be handled. \"I think any time you prosecute a case like this, it's a historical event in a negative way, and the question will be how the Department of Justice will charge and what message that will send,\" Little said. So the prosecutors may decide to hit just a few people with very serious charges, or charge large numbers of people with minor crimes, or both.\n\nLegal experts agree that any leaders identified will face many years in prison. (If anyone is found to be connected to the two reported pipe bombs , that will be its own serious crime.) Those on the scene when a woman was fatally shot could face increased penalties as well, even if a police officer fired the fatal shot. \"From a prosecutor's perspective, the fact that someone died as a result of the chaos today will heighten the sense that there needs to be accountability for those who were responsible for fomenting the violence,\" Jones said.\n\nUltimately, the prosecutors involved will have to think carefully about resources. \"It may be a challenge,\" Jones said. \"There are so many people involved and the prosecutors will have to make fine-grained distinctions between those engaged in lawful First Amendment activities and those who were pressing into the area of sedition and violent attempts to obstruct the lawful functioning of government.\" Still, after the J20 protest, during Trump's inauguration in 2017, and after Black Lives Matter protests, police \"went to great lengths\" to identify who did what. \"That will take work but can and will be done here,\" he said.\n\nThere's still the possibility that Trump could preemptively pardon the rioters in his last days in office. But if that doesn't happen, D.C. prosecutors will be facing an unprecedented situation. \"What makes this different is it appears to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the lawful transfer of power,\" Jones said. \"It's the violence and breadth of the criminality.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Guy Who Filmed the Proud Boys on Jan. 6 Also Made Some Iconic Rap Videos\n\nOn Thursday evening, a bipartisan House select committee launched a blockbuster set of hearings on the Jan. 6 attack and efforts to change the results of the 2020 election. The prime-time presentation aired in full on all three major broadcast networks and ( almost ) every major cable news channel. Among the several star witnesses was an award-winning British filmmaker and documentarian named Nick Quested.\n\nFollowing President Donald Trump's defeat, Quested set forth on a new project to document the division in the United States surrounding the election and how the Republican Party became the party of Trump. To get to the crux of it all, he embedded with the Proud Boys, a group of far-right extremists that has been charged with seditious conspiracy in the Jan. 6 attacks. Quested began following around and filming members of the organization for a documentary, not knowing that he'd wind up collecting seeds of evidence chronicling one of the ugliest days in our nation's history.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox.\n\nOn Thursday, Quested presented shocking footage that included a meeting between the leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, an extreme-right militia, the day before the Capitol riot. But Quested isn't just a random director who stumbled into history. In addition to work documenting war and drug violence, he's notable for another reason: He cut his teeth in the film and direction game in the late '90s and early 2000s by directing music videos -the vast majority of them hip-hop videos. But not for no-name up-and-comers. He was in the director's chair for some of the most iconic names in New York and Southern rap history. Here is some of his most important work.\n\nNick Quested was already about a year deep into his music video phase when he was called on to sketch the visuals for a song that was a response to Tha Dogg Pound's \"New York, New York\" during the height of the tensions between East Coast and West Coast rap artists fueled by the beef between the Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac . He got right to work by staging a kidnapping that culminates with a body-shaped plastic bag being hurled off the Queensboro Bridge. Alrighty.\n\n1998 was the Year of the Dog. DMX's debut album It's Dark and Hell Is Hot would go quadruple platinum off the strength of four scorching singles, with \"Stop Being Greedy\" as the second of the set. DMX raps in two different voices, depicting his good and bad consciences battling for supremacy over a production that sounds like a haunted house tour. Quested understands the assignment and splits DMX into two people to illustrate the theme, throwing in a manhunt in the woods for good measure.\n\nCash Money Records had a diamond-encrusted grip on music in the early 2000s and a very specific aesthetic that paid tribute to the city that raised them: New Orleans. Baby (CEO of the label) and Mannie Fresh (its in-house producer) formed a duo called Big Tymers and sought out Quested to film the video for their exotic car anthem \"Get Your Roll On.\" The smoke machine and bandanna budget was healthy.\n\nThe crown jewel in Quested's music video filmography is \"Special Delivery\" by G-Dep, depicting a very literal translation of the song title. Not only was this one of the biggest songs of the year (on Diddy's Bad Boy label), but it's the most important archive of a dance called the Harlem Shake, a dance that I still can't do properly to this day.\n\nYou couldn't escape 2001 without hearing the infectious, young, and carefree melody of Trick Daddy's \"I'm a Thug.\" Quested sets out to capture Trick on a zany day meeting the family of his girlfriend, while still making time to connect with a bevy of other miscellaneous lady friends, hit the streets in his emerald green spaceship, and buy the neighborhood kids ice cream. Notably, Trick Daddy would go on to tap Quested again for \" Take It to Da House ,\" which includes lyrics that reveal his winning formula: \"Gimme a break, and a beat I can vibe wit / a Nick Quested video and a fine b****.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump Declares Open Season on Abortion Clinics\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn Thursday Donald Trump pardoned 23 anti-abortion activists who had illegally obstructed access to reproductive health clinics around the country. The activists set up blockades around different clinics, sometimes using force to prevent both patients and staff members from entering. President Joe Biden's Department of Justice secured convictions against all of them, but Trump has now freed the entire group, falsely claiming their protests were \"peaceful.\"\n\nOn this week's Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus , Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Trump's latest act of clemency and its dire implications for abortion access under his presidency. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Trump's pardons and the commutations for the Jan. 6 insurrectionists might be the single scariest thing that happened in a really scary week. And now it has an add-on, which is a series of pardons for people who protested-and did a lot more than protest-at abortion facilities. It seems like just another song in a different key: Anybody who decided to take the law into their own hands is just fine as long as they were doing it for something that Donald Trump likes.\n\nOne recipient of a pardon, Lauren Handy, led the blockade of an abortion clinic in D.C. When police arrested her in 2022, authorities removed five fetuses from the home where she was staying. This was not normal or sane or reasonable, yet it was done to make a statement about Trump as an opponent of abortion.\n\nMark Joseph Stern: As you said, this is of a piece with the horrific Jan. 6 pardons and commutations, which freed people from prison who faced yearslong sentences. I mean, Trump freed people who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, who were found to have engaged in acts of terrorism against the federal government. Trump just let them out, and they have already vowed retribution against their enemies. Some have boasted that they're going to go out and buy guns. So everyone who helped put these violent criminals behind bars-lawmakers, judges, jurors, prosecutors, witnesses-is now in danger. It's not subtle what's going on.\n\nThese pardons of abortion protesters are of a piece with that: using the clemency power to reward those who further Trump's agenda by illegal means. We're calling them \"protesters,\" but they aren't just protesters. They blocked access, sometimes for hours on end, to reproductive health clinics. One of the individuals who received a pardon crushed a clinic staff member's hand in a door while blocking access. These people set up barricades around clinics. They terrorize patients and clinic staff. And they prevent people from getting an entire range of health care, including abortion care. That's all illegal under a federal law, the FACE Act , which has been around since the '90s. These defendants were prosecuted under Biden. Now they've been pardoned-freed to go out and continue blockading and obstructing clinics.\n\nWhat Trump is doing here is showing us, once again, that he is not, in fact, a moderate on abortion. He is, I think, declaring open season on reproductive health clinics. His Justice Department has officially scaled back enforcement of the FACE Act, limiting new charges against anti-abortion protesters and dropping charges in pending cases. It says it will only go after the most serious, violent cases of clinic obstruction. Now Trump is telling everyone: Go out, obstruct these clinics, terrorize and assault their staff and patients-and if you are charged or convicted, I will pardon you . It really does feel to me like a bug in the constitutional system, Dahlia, that a president can effectively nullify a federal law like this one by simply promising to pardon anyone who is charged under it. But that's effectively what Trump is doing, and it means that these obstructions around abortion clinics are going to get a whole lot worse in the coming years.\n\nIn a sense, this is accomplishing what Trump can't enact through Congress , right? He can't get an abortion ban passed through Congress, but he can tell anti-abortion zealots: Go out, block the clinics, stop patients from getting care, and I will make sure that you walk free each and every time.\n\nIn a normal week, we would've started by talking about Cecile Richards, former president of Planned Parenthood, and an absolute force for good in the reproductive rights space. She hugely shaped the way I think about this work. And we lost her, way too young, at the beginning of the week. I want to think for a brief moment about the legacy of Cecile-who, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, would be saying right now, in light of these pardons: Keep. Fighting.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "This Week Dropped Several Legal Bombshells on Trump\n\nOn Thursday, Donald Trump released his latest statement condemning the House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Trump ranted that the \"Unselect Committee's sole goal is to try to prevent President Trump, who is leading by large margins in every poll, from running again for president, if I so choose.\"\n\nHis frustration is understandable: This week, investigators into the Jan. 6 attack from both Congress and the Department of Justice came closer than ever before to explicitly putting a target on Trump's back. It's worth recapping the full week's revelations just to see how bad it was for Trump.\n\nFirst, on Wednesday morning, the select committee announced in a legal filing that it believed Trump might have engaged in a felony surrounding his efforts to subvert the election. The committee argued that  attorney-client privilege couldn't attach to testimony and documents being kept under wraps by John Eastman, one of the architects of Trump's plan to disrupt the electoral count on Jan. 6.\n\n\"The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States,\" they alleged. Eastman's testimony and documents would not be protected by attorney-client privilege, the committee argued, due to the crime/fraud exception stating that the privilege is waived when the material under question is part of a criminal act.\n\nEssentially, the committee said it believes Eastman and Trump took part in a federal crime that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $500,000 fine. As the committee also noted, Eastman exercised his Fifth Amendment against self-incriminating testimony 146 separate times during his December testimony. The filing also revealed for the first time that Eastman wrote to Vice President Mike Pence's attorney after the Capitol insurrection to make one final plea for Pence to delay the counting of the electoral votes. \"I implore you to consider one more relatively minor violation\" of the law \"and adjourn for 10 days,\" Eastman pleaded.\n\nIf the vote count had been postponed, Pence and Congress would have been delayed in certifying that Joe Biden had won the election. It would have also given then-President Trump time to do who knows what to thwart the inauguration (he reportedly considered a draft executive order seizing voting machines and several of his close confidants had proposed he declare martial law during that time). Critically, though, Eastman acknowledged in this email to Pence that he knew what he was asking for was a violation of the law. \"Plaintiff knew what he was proposing would violate the law, but he nonetheless urged the Vice President to take those actions,\" the committee wrote.\n\nThe committee didn't stop there, releasing damning testimony from Trump's close aides who said that they repeatedly told him that conspiracy theories around the election were bogus and had been refuted by a Department of Justice investigation. Trump campaign senior advisor Jason Miller, for instance, told the committee that he had \"several\" conversations with Trump in which he told the president that \"specific to election day fraud and irregularities, there were not enough to overturn the election.\" Miller also said that he was at an Oval Office meeting while the votes were still being counted during which Trump was told outright he was going to lose the vote. \"I remember [campaign data specialist Matt Oczkowski] delivered to the President in pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose,\" Miller testified.\n\nIn separate testimony, former Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue told Trump that his claims of fraud had been checked by the Department of Justice and were completely bogus. Even after being told, on multiple separate occasions, that there was no evidence of fraud Trump still threatened to fire Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and replace him with Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Jeffrey Clark who was promising to announce that non-existent fraud had likely happened and to tell state legislatures to reconsider their votes. \"The President said something to the effect of, 'What do I have to lose? If I do this, what do I have to lose?'\" Donoghue testified of Trump's response to pushback to this part of a coup plan.\n\nConsider the magnitude of this evidence.  Not only did Eastman know what he was doing was illegal, but also Trump was repeatedly told by his own staff that he had lost and that his claims about fraud were wrong. Yet he still went ahead with Eastman's plan anyway. These facts suggest that both men knew-or were clearly told-what they were doing was wrong and did it anyway, negating attorney-client privilege if a crime was committed.\n\nFinally, and perhaps worst of all for Trump, the committee says it's possible Trump engaged in a conspiracy with rioters that day, though there is less evidence in the filing to that effect.\n\n\"In addition to the legal effort to delay the certification, there is also evidence that the conspiracy extended to the rioters engaged in acts of violence at the Capitol,\" the committee wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, another (big) shoe dropped regarding potential links between Trump and the Jan. 6 mob. After the Jan. 6 committee's filing, the Department of Justice announced that a member of the Oath Keepers militia, Joshua James, pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy for his role organizing the attack on the Capitol. Why is that bad for Trump? James had previously been photographed as a bodyguard for Trump confidant and political fixer Roger Stone.\n\nIndeed, the morning of Jan. 6 , James was seen in Stone's private hotel suite at the Willard in Washington D.C. just hours before he joined the assault on the Capitol. James is now going to cooperate with investigators and take part in grand jury testimony, presumably against the other Oath Keeper defendants charged with seditious conspiracy, including Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes, who Stone was also in close contact with in the days before the insurrection, according to public records. James would also presumably have to testify about what he saw in Stone's \"War Room\" at the Willard prior to the assault on the Capitol.\n\nTo recap: the DOJ investigation has moved one step closer to Trump, and potentially just one step away from directly implicating the former president via Stone.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough for the former president, on Thursday, his son Donald Trump Jr's fiancée, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was in close contact with the president on Jan. 6, was hit with a subpoena for her testimony by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nAnd if all of that wasn't enough, Trump got even more bad news on Friday, after his enraged statement against the committee, when the Washington Post reported details of an upcoming documentary by Danish filmmaker Christoffer Guldbrandsen, which details Stone's activities in the leadup to and aftermath of Jan. 6. Those details are staggering. Guldbrandsen's documentary reportedly includes footage of James and Stone together; footage of Stone on the phone as the attack was happening; images of Stone's cell phone showing his connection to Rhodes and to Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio (members of the Proud Boys have also been charged in organizing the assault on the Capitol); and a draft memo Stone wrote to Trump after the Capitol insurrection seeking pardons for himself, others involved in Jan. 6, and even multiple members of the Colombo crime family convicted of murder and racketeering in the 1990s.\n\nAccording to the Post's account of the documentary, when the pardons weren't delivered, Stone turned on Trump:\n\nStone unloaded on Donald Trump, saying he had betrayed his friends, deserved to be impeached and was the \"greatest single mistake in American history.\"\n\nStone added that Trump might be vulnerable to prosecution by federal authorities in Manhattan after declining to preemptively pardon himself.\n\n\"A good, long sentence in prison will give him a chance to think about it, because the Southern District is coming for him, and he did nothing,\" Stone said.\n\nThough months later he would support a possible Trump bid for the White House in 2024, on Inauguration Day he mocked the idea. \"Run again! You'll get your f-ing brains beat in,\" Stone said.\n\nStone had already been pardoned by Trump previously after being sentenced to three years in prison for witness intimidation and lying to investigators to cover up what he and Trump may have known about WikiLeaks' release of hacked documents of the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nAfter the lack of preemptive pardons, Stone also reportedly wrote a message to another Trump associate: \"see you in prison.\" Stone doesn't sound like the most reliable friend for Trump to have at this point, especially since he can no longer dangle pardons in front of his face to keep him quiet. So after a week full of damning revelations, no wonder the former president is upset!\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Prosecutors argued he directed his troops remotely with messages about revolution and telling them \"don't f---ing leave\" after the building was breached that afternoon.\n\nHe was accused of orchestrating a fighting force with a group they called the \"Ministry of Self Defense\" comprised of dedicated Proud Boys and top leaders.\n\nTarrio's conviction follows the case of Stewart Rhodes, leader of another far-right group called Oath Keepers, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the events of Jan. 6.\n\nVideo of the two ringleaders meeting in a Washington parking garage on the eve of Jan. 6 was part of the volumes of footage obtained by the Justice Department in the case.\n\nMembership in the Proud Boys surged after then-President Donald Trump told the group to \"stand back and stand by\" during a 2020 presidential debate. Tarrio's attorneys blamed Trump for encouraging and revving up the crowd that ultimately broke into the Capitol.\n\nThe case is a win for authorities pursuing the hundreds of rioters who breached the Capitol. More than 1,000 arrests have been made in connection with Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department.\n\n\"Today's verdict makes clear that the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, adding, \"our work will continue.\"\n\nThursday was the seventh day of deliberations during which jurors asked multiple questions.\n\nWith dozens of witnesses and mountains of video and social media evidence, the Proud Boys trial has been the longest to date in the Justice Department's pursuit of Capitol rioters.\n\nSince jury selection began in December, the case has dragged on with bitter arguments, frequent objections and mistrial motions. At times, Judge Kelly lost his temper and admonished the lawyers for interrupting or seeming to ignore his directions.\n\nThe Proud Boys insisted there were no plans to attack the Capitol and sought to cast themselves as nothing more than a hard-charging social club in which partying, drinking and exchanging crude jokes went along with attending political protests.\n\nThe group also describes themselves as \"Western chauvinists,\" an unapologetic brand of fervent nationalism.\n\nProsecutors emphasized to the jury that the Proud Boys did not need to have detailed -- or successful -- plans to be found guilty. The conspiracy allegations hinged on their mutual understanding to oppose the government by force.\n\nABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Jury convicts Oath Keepers leader, 1 other of seditious conspiracy in Jan. 6 trial\n\nJurors deliberated for nearly three days.\n\nThe leader of the far-right Oath Keepers group on Tuesday was found guilty of conspiring against the federal government as part of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol -- a major conviction in prosecutors' ongoing cases against the rioters that day.\n\nStewart Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate-turned-militiaman, was convicted of his most serious charge, seditious conspiracy, following a sprawling two-month trial in federal court in Washington and three days of jury deliberations.\n\nAn associate, Kelly Meggs, was also found guilty of seditious conspiracy in the first such convictions by a jury since 1995. They could both face a maximum of 20 years in prison for that charge alone.\n\nMeggs and Rhodes, along with three others connected to the Oath Keepers, who were all tried together, were each convicted on some but notably not all of their charges -- indicating jurors rejected some of the prosecutions' arguments. Three of the five were acquitted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nDefense attorneys vowed on Tuesday to appeal.\n\n\"There are good results and bad results mixed together. We're grateful for the not-guilty verdicts that we received. We're disappointed in the guilty verdicts,\" Rhodes' defense attorney Ed Tarpley said afterward, adding that he doesn't see the verdict as a win for the Department of Justice in the larger scheme of the Jan. 6 prosecutions.\n\nThe accused were charged with disrupting the peaceful transfer of power by conspiring to oppose by force the certification of President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory on Jan. 6, 2021, among other felonies.\n\nAll five defendants -- Meggs, Rhodes, Thomas Caldwell, Kenneth Harrelson and Jessica Watkins, three of whom testified in their own defense -- were found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding: in this case, the certification of Biden's election.\n\nCaldwell, whose only other guilty verdict was tampering with potential evidence, will remain on supervised release despite the government's request to have him jailed pending any appeal or sentencing. Caldwell was acquitted on seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiring to impede a U.S. official. During testimony, he said he was not a member of the Oath Keepers, despite his association with the group.\n\nMeggs, Harrelson and Watkins were all acquitted on charges that they damaged government property. That finding by the jury suggests defense lawyers were successful in showing how the defendants were not among the first lines of rioters to break through barriers and enter the Capitol last year.\n\nWatkins and Meggs were both found guilty of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding in addition to actual obstruction. In arguing those charges, prosecutors relied on group texts and social media posts written before and after Jan. 6.\n\n\"We PATRIOTS took the Capitol...\" Watkins wrote on the website Parler. \"I stormed into the capitol in full battle rattle... stop the steal.\"\n\nThe rarely-used seditious conspiracy statute was signed into law following the Civil War with the aim of prosecuting Southerners who may still want to fight against the government.\n\nIn the Oath Keepers trial, the defendants were not charged with seeking to overthrow the U.S. government -- rather, prosecutors argued their conduct fell within the portion of the statute related to conspiring to oppose the government's authority and forcibly block the execution of laws.\n\nThe Justice Department hasn't brought seditious conspiracy charges since 2010, when prosecutors indicted several Michigan residents and members of the Hutaree militia with conspiring to oppose by force the authority of the U.S. government. But the defendants were all acquitted after a judge determined that prosecutors had hinged too much of their case on statements that were First Amendment protected speech.\n\nRhodes himself did not enter the Capitol on Jan. 6 and maintained that his group only intended to provide security and medical aid to those attending multiple pro-Donald Trump demonstrations in the area.\n\nProsecutors spent months piecing together their case ahead of trial, documenting the conversations, messages and actions of the defendants leading up to their involvement with the insurrection and their alleged efforts to cover up their activity afterward.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler said in court last week that the defendants who testified were lying about several pieces of evidence such as Caldwell's description of a video showing protesters confronting Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham at an airport after Jan. 6.\n\nCaldwell had said he thought they were confronting Graham about confirming judges, not certifying the 2020 election.\n\nNestler rejected the explanation from the defense that Oath Keepers had come to Washington to provide protection for people on Jan. 6. The defense made no mention of anyone specific whom the Oath Keepers were providing security for, he noted.\n\n\"Why lie about a fact?\" Nestler asked rhetorically. \"The answer: because the truth is so damning.\"\n\nJurors had to weigh dozens of charges at trial and found each of the five defendants guilty of some crimes and not guilty of others.\n\nIn addition to seditious conspiracy, Rhodes was also found guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding and of tampering with documents/aiding and abetting. He was found not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging duties.\n\nIn addition to seditious conspiracy Meggs was also found guilty of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, of obstructing an official proceeding, of conspiring to prevent an officer from discharging duties and of tampering with documents. Meggs was found not guilty of destruction of government property/aiding and abetting.\n\nHarrelson was found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding, of conspiring to prevent an officer from discharging duties and of tampering with documents. In addition to the seditious conspiracy acquittal, Harrelson was found not guilty of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding and destruction of government property.\n\nWatkins was found guilty of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiring to prevent an officer from discharging duties and civil disorder. In addition to the seditious conspiracy acquittal, Watkins was found not guilty of destruction of government property/aiding and abetting.\n\nCaldwell was found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding and of tampering with documents but not guilty of seditious conspiracy, conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiring to prevent an officer from discharging duties.\n\nRhodes, who founded the anti-government Oath Keepers in 2009, sent increasingly frantic messages to members of the group following the 2020 election about their need to be prepared to prevent Biden from taking office.\n\nUsing a massive and sometime strikingly candid cache of phone records, messages and recordings as evidence, prosecutors attempted to tie the defendants' far-right political beliefs with a desire to forcibly oppose the certification of Biden's election.\n\n\"We aren't getting through this without a civil war,\" Rhodes said in a Nov. 5 message presented by prosecutors.\n\nThe defense argued that no plot to disrupt government proceedings ever materialized among the group and their discussions of violence were largely rhetorical and were not taken seriously.\n\n\"Yes, things were said,\" Rhodes' attorney James Bright said. \"It was heated rhetoric. Horribly heated rhetoric. Bombast. Inappropriate.\"\n\nAt the same time, the defendants said they came to Washington to provide security because they feared violence from far-left groups at the pro-Trump events held on Jan. 6, 2021. Three of the defendants -- Caldwell, Watkins and Rhodes -- all opted to take the witness stand.\n\nDuring cross-examination and throughout the trial, prosecutors displayed evidence to undermine their credibility and used messages and social media posts that appeared to contradict their innocent explanations. At one point, Meggs said he wanted to \"go on a killing spree\" and first target House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following the 2020 election.\n\nRhodes, in taking the rare step of testifying on his own behalf during the trial, told the court he continues to believe that the 2020 election was unconstitutional because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions implemented by states to make voting more accessible.\n\nJames Lee Bright, an attorney for Rhodes, said Tuesday after the verdicts that Rhodes had not shied away from testifying.\n\n\"We admonished him and went over his legal rights with him, but we knew from the get-go there was no way that we could keep him from taking the stand and he's going to be willing to do that in future trials,\" Bright said.\n\nRelying on testimony from the FBI, prosecutors said at trial that Rhodes worked between the 2020 election and Jan. 6 to rally his troops -- many of them former law enforcement and military service members -- and purchased thousands of dollars worth of weapons as he traveled across the country toward Washington.\n\n\"It will be a bloody and desperate fight,\" Rhodes wrote in a Dec. 11, 2020, message to other Oath Keepers. \"We are going to have a fight. That can't be avoided.\"\n\nThe group's preparations for violence occurred over messages and in person, with Rhodes and his associates attending a series of demonstrations and events in 2020 where, prosecutors said, they claimed to act as security.\n\n\"We will have to do a bloody, massively bloody revolution against them,\" Rhodes allegedly told a regional Oath Keepers leader in December 2020. \"That's what's going to happen.\"\n\nIn his testimony from the witness stand, however, Rhodes sought to paint a far different picture of the Oath Keepers -- describing them as a community service organization that helped veterans transition into civilian life. He said the group's actions, like purposely storing their weapons outside the Washington city limits on Jan. 6, showed they never intended to violate the law.\n\nAnd he sought to distance himself from members of the group who entered the Capitol building, saying those people went \"off-mission\" and that he never would have ordered anyone to storm the halls of Congress.\n\nRhodes acknowledged under questioning from his attorney that in the weeks leading up to and after Jan. 6 he wanted President Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and essentially mobilize his militia's members to prevent him from being removed as president. But, Rhodes said, he never believed he was asking Trump to do something that was unlawful and that he believed that Trump could use the Insurrection Act to overrule states who had changed their voting procedures over the pandemic.\n\nWatkins is a veteran and former EMT who was running a bar in Ohio around the time of Jan. 6 and had started a militia group of her own before joining with the Oath Keepers.\n\nWatkins' fiancé, Montana Siniff, testified on her behalf as the first witness called by the defense.\n\nSiniff testified that he and Watkins had met at a comic book shop in 2015. When he asked her out on a date about a year later, she \"blurted out\" that she was transgender and they started dating. The pair started their own militia group prior to joining the Oath Keepers and, Siniff said, originally intended the group to serve in response to natural disasters.\n\nThe government alleged that Watkins was part of one of the \"stacks\" or organized strike teams that set out to breach the Capitol on Jan. 6. According to one message presented by the government, Watkins told her fiancé she had in fact \"stormed the capitol\" and had \"forced\" her way in with others. Video evidence also shows Watkins inside the Capitol that day yelling at law enforcement who were trying to control the mob.\n\nMeggs is seen in videos as part of the military-style \"stack\" of Oath Keepers that entered through the east side of the Capitol on Jan. 6. Prosecutors alleged he and other members of the stack, including Watkins and Harrelson, were specifically seeking out Pelosi after they breached the Capitol but left the building after they couldn't find her.\n\n\"[W]as hoping to see Nancy's head rolling down the front steps,\" an associate of Meggs texted to him a little after 7 o'clock the night of Jan. 6.\n\n\"We looked [for] her,\" Meggs responded.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta previously cited that text from Meggs in an order last year denying Meggs' request to be released from pre-trial detention, arguing it spoke to Meggs' ongoing danger to the general public.\n\nDefense attorney Brad Geyer cast his client, Harrelson, as an apolitical public servant who wanted to use his experience from the military to help others. Geyer emphasized that Harrelson had been off social media since 2014 and hadn't engaged in the same online vitriol that others had fanned.\n\n\"He had no political objectives that day,\" Geyer contended. \"That's what the evidence will show.\"\n\nHarrelson was accused of helping to amass firearms in a Virginia hotel as part of a so-called \"quick reaction force\" in anticipation of violence on Jan. 6.\n\nGeyer said that Harrelson had never voted in a presidential election and did not know what the Electoral College was or how Congress worked.\n\nThe defense attorneys also vigorously disputed the government's narrative about the \"quick reaction force,\" noting that at no point did the government allege that any of the firearms at the hotel were brought into Washington. on Jan. 6 or afterward and that Rhodes never called on such weapons to come to the Capitol in the midst of the riot.\n\nIn his own testimony, Rhodes denied having any knowledge about the specifics of the munitions.\n\nLike Rhodes, Caldwell took the witness stand to defend himself against the conspiracy and related charges he faced.\n\nAlthough at one point he said he was \"allied\" with members of the Oath Keepers, Caldwell subsequently tried to disassociate himself with the militia group, testifying that while he was friendly with the members, he was not one himself.\n\nCaldwell portrayed himself as an innocent elderly man with a big mouth, repeatedly noting that his protracted spinal injuries from his time in the military made it difficult for him to walk around Washington on Jan. 6.\n\n\"I'm a walking disaster,\" he said of his injuries. He also had hip replacement surgery earlier this year.\n\nWhile he was not accused of entering the Capitol, Caldwell and his wife acknowledged they did walk up steps on the west front of the building -- as part of a large group -- to the exterior balcony constructed for the presidential inauguration.\n\nFour other members of the Oath Keepers charged with seditious conspiracy are slated to go to trial later this month. Three members of the group have previously pleaded guilty to the charge of seditious conspiracy and entered into cooperation agreements with the federal government but, notably, did not testify at this trial.\n\nABC News' Briana Stewart contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes sentenced to 18 years for leading Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy\n\nJudge Amit Mehta opted to enhance Rhodes' sentence for terrorism.\n\nA federal judge sentenced Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes to 18 years in prison Thursday and accepted the government's recommendation of an enhancement for terrorism for his role leading a seditious conspiracy to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory that culminated in the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 .\n\nRhodes' sentence is now the longest to date handed down to a defendant charged in connection with the Capitol assault.\n\nFor the first time in a Jan. 6 case, D.C. District Judge Amit Mehta accepted the government's recommendation to apply an enhancement for terrorism in Rhodes' sentencing. Mehta agreed with prosecutors that Rhodes \"inspired the use of violence\" in his followers to disrupt the certification and that his conduct met the legal definition of terrorism intended to influence the actions of government.\n\nMehta cited the stockpile of weapons the Oath Keepers had amassed just outside of Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, as well as Rhodes' orders for members to delete incriminating messages after the Capitol assault.\n\n\"You, sir, present an ongoing threat and peril to this country,\" Mehta told Rhodes just before handing down his sentence.\n\nBefore his sentence was handed down, Rhodes opted to address Mehta in defiant remarks maintaining his innocence and describing himself as a \"political prisoner.\"\n\n\"Like President Trump, my only crime is opposing those who are destroying our country,\" Rhodes said.\n\nIn his own remarks just before handing down his sentence, Mehta pushed back directly on Rhodes' claims of being a political prisoner, saying instead he poses an \"ongoing threat to this country.\"\n\n\"For decades it is clear that you wanted the democracy in this country to devolve into violence,\" Mehta said. \"You're not a political prisoner. You're here because 12 jurors in D.C. who acquitted you of multiple counts found you guilty of sedition.\"\n\n\"It could have been a far uglier day ... and people should not forget that,\" he said of Jan. 6.\n\nAfter the sentence was handed down, Rhodes' attorneys said they did not agree with the sentence but also expected a much stronger one than Rhodes had received. They said this sentence speaks volumes to anyone who gets convicted of sedition.\n\nPrior to Thursday, the harshest sentence for a defendant charged in connection with Jan. 6 was 170 months, or just over 14 years.\n\nThe Justice Department was seeking 25 years for Rhodes, with a prosecutor saying in court Thursday that a harsh sentence was critical \"to ensure the respect for the rule of law that is essential to the survival of our democracy.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said Rhodes \"doggedly drilled in the minds of those on his chats, and those followers of the Oath Keepers the lie of the election fraud, and the false need to act like the Founding Fathers in order to save in his view, our Constitution and our country.\" She said it was \"neither the first time nor the last time that he will seek to organize political violence in our country,\" and pointed to statements he made from jail just four days ago to a protest gathered outside where he said it would \"take regime change\" to fix the wrongs being done by the Biden Administration.\n\n\"It's not going to stop until its stopped,\" Rakoczy said, quoting Rhodes' remarks.\n\nRhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States last November. A jury found he and other members of the group played a principal role in disrupting the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nThe decision marked the first successful seditious conspiracy conviction by a jury since 1995.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors sought 25 years for Rhodes, their highest recommendation yet for a defendant charged in connection with Jan. 6.\n\nIn their sentencing recommendation to Mehta, they argued repeatedly that harsh sentences for all the Oath Keepers charged in the conspiracy were necessary in order to deter future potential attacks against democracy.\n\nJuries in two separate trials returned convictions against Rhodes and eight of his associates on a variety of serious felony charges, though three from the group were acquitted of the most serious charge of seditious conspiracy.\n\nRelying on a trove of messages between the group's members discussing \"civil war\" in the event of Biden taking office, prosecutors argued that Rhodes and his co-conspirators were willing to take any action necessary, including using force, to stop the certification.\n\nProsecutors also presented extensive evidence of the group's planning in advance of Jan. 6, showing how members stashed a massive cache of weapons at a hotel just outside city limits that the government argued would be transported into Washington in the event Trump invoked the Insurrection Act.\n\nStemming from unfounded claims of election fraud, the defendants railed against the government in private chats and social media posts.\n\nRhodes remained defiant in remarks before his sentence was ultimately handed down on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, police officers who defended the Capitol and a Senate aide who carried the official 2020 election documents spoke in court to explain the continuing trauma they face more than two years after the riots.\n\n\"We were assaulted time and time again,\" D.C. police officer Christopher Owens told he court. He talked about the violent mob repeatedly grabbing at his police gear, even trying to take his weapon.\n\nHis voice heavy with emotion, Owens described coming home to his family and his wife sobbing after seeing his bruised and battered his body.\n\n\"We experienced physical trauma, emotional trauma and mental trauma,\" he said.\n\nMehta thanked each of the witnesses for their remarks and government service.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "More Oath Keeper defendants sentenced for Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy\n\nRoberto Minuta and Edward Vallejo were sentenced to several years behind bars.\n\nA federal judge sentenced two Oath Keeper defendants Thursday for their roles in disrupting the certification of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nEdward Vallejo was sentenced to three years in prison while Roberto Minuta received a term of four years and six months. Both sentences were a significant departure from the 17 years the government requested for each defendant after the two were convicted earlier this year of sedition and conspiracy to derail Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nProsecutors argued Minuta was a key leader of the \"second wave\" of Oath Keepers who stormed the Capitol. He was joined by Joshua James, who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy last year.\n\nAs part of his guilty plea, James admitted he and fellow members brought weapons, including a rifle, shotgun, semi-automatic handgun and ammunition to the greater Washington, D.C., area. James acknowledged he breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, intending to stop the electoral college certification, with Minuta by his side.\n\nAt his sentencing, Minuta flatly denied any knowledge of plans between Oath Keepers, including the stockpile some had amassed at a Virginia hotel.\n\n\"I did not know about any guns in Virginia whatsoever,\" Minuta said.\n\nMinuta continued to insist he went into the Capitol to help police officers in distress. He apologized to the judge for entering the building.\n\n\"I shouldn't have and I'm sorry that I did,\" he said. \"I was presented with an opportunity to help police and I blew it.\"\n\n\"I did not want to advance into the building, and I left James in there as soon as I could get out,\" he added.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta said he found no evidence that Minuta entered the building to help police.\n\n\"You and I will have to agree to disagree about that,\" Mehta said.\n\nMehta also found no evidence that Minuta himself brought a weapon into the district or served as a critical leader of the group. However, Mehta did apply a terrorism enhancement to the sentence that was ultimately handed down.\n\nVallejo himself wasn't accused of taking any violent actions on Jan. 6, but prosecutors argued his position as a leader of the \"quick reaction force\" was even more serious. Oath Keepers amassed a cache of weapons at a Virginia hotel where Vallejo awaited orders from those in Washington, D.C., prosecutors alleged.\n\nDefense attorney Matthew Peed argued that Vallejo was influenced by Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and then-President Donald Trump to think what he was doing was patriotic. As an example of his respect for the democratic process, Peed said Vallejo had been a major supporter of former Rep. Ron Paul, even attending a national political convention on his behalf.\n\n\"He just thought that something different (on Jan. 6) was happening because the President had told him,\" Peed said.\n\nVallejo was also sentenced to three years of supervised release following his prison term, including time on home confinement.\n\n\"He has had an impeccable pre-trial record,\" Mehta said, before allowing Vallejo to walk out of court and self-surrender.\n\nLast week, Rhodes received the longest sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant to date at 18 years, a decision that was also handed down by Mehta.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "3 years later, Jan. 6 by the numbers: More than 1,200 charged, more than 460 imprisoned for role in Capitol attack\n\nProsecutors have secured more than 718 guilty pleas in Jan. 6 cases.\n\nIn the three years since the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, federal prosecutors have charged more than 1,265 defendants across nearly all 50 states and D.C. and secured sentences of incarceration for more than 460 people, according to newly released numbers from the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C.\n\nIn remarks Friday, Attorney General Merrick Garland described the Justice Department's sprawling probe of the Capitol attack as \"one of the largest and most complex and resource-intensive investigations in our history.\"\n\nOf the more than 1,265 individuals charged since Jan. 6, 2021, department prosecutors have secured more than 718 guilty pleas -- including 213 who pleaded to felonies that include assaults on federal officers, obstructing law enforcement and seditious conspiracy.\n\nAlso, 171 others have been found guilty at trial or otherwise convicted, the D.C. U.S. Attorney Office said.\n\nWhile 467 individuals have been sentenced to periods of incarceration, hundreds of others have been sentenced for lesser offenses to periods of home detention or probation.\n\nThe harshest sentence yet handed down as part of DOJ's investigation was for Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio , who was sentenced to 22 years in prison last September after being found guilty on charges of seditious conspiracy and other felonies. The founder of the anti-government extremist group the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes , was sentenced to 18 years in prison in May of last year for his role in leading the militia group in the Jan. 6 attacks.\n\nThe Jan. 6 attack caused millions of dollars in damages to the Capitol building and its grounds. The latest report from October 2022 estimated the losses at more than $2.8 million.\n\n\"That amount reflects, among other things, damage to the Capitol building and grounds and certain costs borne by the U.S. Capitol Police,\" the US Attorney's Office in D.C. said.\n\nThe investigations into Jan. 6 are far from over as officials still continue to track down more than 80 rioters suspected of assaults on law enforcement during the riot. The FBI has posted videos seeking tips from the public on the identities of various suspects, and each week a steady drumbeat of individuals are charged with other offenses including civil disorder and illegal entry into the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Attorney for D.C. Matt Graves warned in a news conference this week, however, that time could be running out for charging many of the suspects involved in the attack. Statutes of limitations for many of the charges deployed by prosecutors will expire on Jan. 5, 2026 - on the eve of the riot's five-year anniversary.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Vallejo and another member discussed the possibility of \"armed conflict\" and \"guerilla war\" on a podcast the morning of Jan. 6, according to evidence produced by prosecutors.\n\nDefense attorneys stressed that those who amassed a cache of firearms at the Virginia hotel were mindful of Washington's strict gun laws and were merely exercising their rights in self-defense.\n\nHackett and Moerschel were seen in images as part of the now-infamous military style \"stack\" formation of Oath Keepers who moved throughout the mob together during the riot.\n\nMinuta was previously been identified as having served as a bodyguard for Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone on Jan. 6 before he and another member of the Oath Keepers rushed to the Capitol in a golf cart to join other members of the militia.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Monday after the verdicts, lawyers for two of the defendants made it clear that they felt their clients weren't able to get a fair trial due to the shadow of the Jan. 6 insurrection -- with one of the attorneys suggesting President Donald Trump was morally responsible for the attack.\n\n\"These are not evil insurrectionists that the media makes them out to be,\" Scott Weinberg, an attorney for Moerschel, said.\n\n\"These men were swept up by the 'stop the steal' nonsense that was pushed by the president,\" Weinberg added, vowing an appeal.\n\nBill Shipley, who represented Minuta, said \"an argument could be made [that] the entire district was in some ways victimized by the event\" of Jan. 6. \"How do you have a trial when the only jurors you can draw from are in some meaningful way victims?\" he said.\n\nHe didn't say whether Minuta would appeal but called the seditious conspiracy statute \"ancient.\"\n\nSeparately, at a roundtable event at the Justice Department, Attorney General Merrick Garland celebrated the verdicts.\n\n\"I'm thankful to the prosecutors, agents and staff for their outstanding work in connection with this matter,\" he said.\n\nABC News' Beatrice Peterson contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Former Proud Boys leaders Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl sentenced for Jan. 6 sedition\n\nBiggs' sentence is the second longest in connection with the Capitol attack.\n\nTwo former Proud Boys leaders who had been convicted of seditious conspiracy for their actions during the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol were sentenced on Thursday, with the judge handing down one of the longest sentences yet for someone charged in the Jan. 6 attacks.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced Joseph Biggs, the former leader of the group's Florida chapter, to 17 years in prison. He sentenced Zachary Rehl, the former leader of the Proud Boys' Philadelphia chapter, to 15 years in prison.\n\nBiggs, a U.S. army veteran, was a close ally of the former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio. Biggs was convicted of seditious conspiracy in May alongside two other Proud Boys leaders following a more than four-month-long trial.\n\nIn handing down his sentence, Judge Kelly accepted the government's recommendation to apply an enhancement that effectively labeled Biggs' crimes as acts of terrorism in seeking to influence the actions of government through threats and use of force.\n\nProsecutors had sought 33 years in prison for Biggs, their longest recommended prison sentence yet for any participant convicted of joining the Jan. 6 assault -- their same recommendation for Tarrio. They had previously sought 25 years in prison for Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, who was convicted for leading his far-right militia members in a separate seditious conspiracy and sentenced earlier this year to 18 years in prison .\n\nBiggs' sentence is the second longest for any defendant charged in connection with the Capitol attack; Rehl's sentence is the third longest. Tarrio is set to be sentenced next Tuesday.\n\nProsecutors characterized Biggs as the \"tip of the spear\" for the mob throughout the Capitol attack in his role as co-leader of the so-called \"Ministry of Self Defense,\" a planning team that later evolved into the Proud Boys' Jan. 6 ground operation.\n\n\"The evidence at trial demonstrated that Biggs was a vocal leader and influential proponent of the group's shift toward political violence,\" prosecutors said in their sentencing memo for Biggs. \"More than perhaps any other, Biggs appreciated the tactical advantage that his force had that day, and he understood the significance of his actions against his own government.\"\n\nThey pointed to increasingly threatening and violent rhetoric espoused by Biggs in the days after the November 2020 election leading up to the Jan. 6 attack -- and noted that he had encouraged Tarrio to \"get radical and get real men\" only hours after former President Donald Trump first announced plans for his supporters to rally in Washington on the day of the certification.\n\nDuring the assault on the Capitol, prosecutors said Biggs played a role in four separate breaches of law enforcement lines, and after entering the building made his way to the Senate chamber.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, Biggs recorded a podcast-style interview where he celebrated the attack as a \"warning shot to the government\" that showed them \"how weak they truly are.\"\n\nIn Thursday's hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason McCullough sought to make the case to Judge Kelly that a significant sentence was warranted for Biggs and the other Proud Boys for deterrence purposes -- setting an example to other extremists that carrying out similar attacks against the government would be punished severely.\n\n\"There is a reason why we will hold our collective breaths as we approach future elections,\" McCullough said during the hearing. \"That's what they aimed to do. They aimed to intimidate and terrify elected officials, law enforcement and the rest of the country that they didn't agree with and make them heel to their political point of view.\"\n\nHe added, \"The repercussions here must be known.\"\n\nBiggs' attorney Norm Pattis argued for leniency, claiming that much of the statements pointed to by the government should be protected under his rights to free speech and, despite his guilt as determined by the jury, \"we think that the crimes are overstated in this case and that the case was overproven.\"\n\n\"To treat these men as terrorists would be the functional equivalent of the destruction of Waco,\" Pattis said, referencing the 1993 siege by the U.S. government and Texas law enforcement of the Branch Davidians' compound.\n\nAddressing the court himself, Biggs became emotional as he sought to dispute the characterization of him as a \"terrorist\" and begged for leniency so he could one day be released to care for his daughter.\n\n\"On Jan. 6 I was seduced by the crowd and I just moved forward,\" Biggs said. \"My curiosity got the better of me and I have to live with that for the rest of my life, and I'm so sorry.\"\n\nRehl helped lead the charge on Jan. 6 and was among the first wave of rioters to breach the Capitol. Also, he helped overwhelm officers, spraying one in the face with an irritant spray, according to the sentencing memo.\n\nRehl later made posts on social media calling Jan. 6 a \"historical day,\" and told his mother how proud he was of the Proud Boys' Capitol attack, according to the sentencing memo.\n\nProsecutors had requested 30 years behind bars for Rehl, who they argued served a \"key logistical role\" for the Proud Boys during the Capitol assault and helped relay information to co-conspirators that weren't even in the city that day about what was happening on the ground.\n\nRehl was also accused of perjuring himself 14 times when testifying at trial after he was confronted with video evidence showing him spraying police officers with a chemical irritant.\n\n\"Rehl's words and actions reveal his intent on January 6 -- he was there to use force and violence to influence his government and lead a civil war,\" prosecutors wrote in their sentencing recommendation.\n\nAfter detailing his conduct at the hearing and determining he did indeed perjure himself during trial, Judge Kelly said he calculated his sentencing guideline range as between 30 years to life in prison -- higher than the guidelines set for Biggs earlier in the day. But similar to Biggs, Kelly delivered a sentenced significantly below the guidelines because he said he believed the terrorism enhancement applied to his sentence actually overstated the seriousness of his conduct.\n\nBefore he was sentenced, Rehl broke down into tears as he pleaded for leniency from Kelly and asked for forgiveness from his family.\n\n\"I'm done with politics,\" he said. \"I'm done peddling lies for people that don't care about me... Jan. 6 was a despicable day.\"\n\nJudge Kelly singled out Rehl's conduct spraying police officers and later lying about it as unique from his other Proud Boys co-defendants, and said his statements after the riot celebrating what had happened were \"chilling.\"\n\n-ABC News' Sarah Beth Hensley contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Two more Oath Keeper defendants sentenced for Jan. 6 sedition\n\nA former neuroscientist and chiropractor are the latest to receive prison terms.\n\nTwo more Oath Keeper defendants were sentenced Friday, the latest in a series of new prison terms for those convicted of disrupting the Jan. 6 certification of the 2020 election.\n\nOath Keeper David Moerschel, a former neuroscientist, was sentenced to three years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges. He was joined by his co-defendant Joseph Hackett, who was sentenced to three years and six months on Friday. Both sentences were a fraction of the recommendation from prosecutors who said Moerschel and Hackett each deserved 10 and 12 years, respectively.\n\nLast January, the two were found guilty of conspiring to commit sedition against the United States. That jury convicted both men of three additional felonies, finding they had plans to disrupt the electoral college certification and were -- at least partially -- successful.\n\nHackett, a former chiropractor from Florida, was also found guilty for destroying evidence.\n\n\"I regret being there that day,\" Hackett told the judge Friday. \"I regret ever joining the Oath Keepers.\"\n\nHe said his wife and young daughter have received threats since he was first identified as someone who breached the Capitol.\n\n\"I did this to my family,\" he said. \"I am the reason we are not enjoying a happy and normal life.\"\n\nMoerschel and Hackett were part of a group of nine Oath Keeper defendants charged with seditious conspiracy for hatching a plot to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's election victory. Eight have been sentenced over the past two weeks including Stewart Rhodes, the defiant Oath Keepers founder who received the longest sentence connected to the Jan. 6 riot -- 18 years -- last week.\n\nKelly Meggs, one of Rhodes' chief lieutenants, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Several of the sentences handed down included an enhancement for terrorism.\n\nMoerschel expressed regret to the court on Friday and said he was wrong to take orders from top Oath Keepers on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"I don't mean anything bad about Kelly Meggs, but he's a used car salesman,\" he said. \"It was really dumb to follow that guy.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Proud Boys members testify in Jan. 6 sedition case: 'It was a terrible day'\n\nTwo Proud Boys admitted to some wrongdoing and denied the most serious charges.\n\nTwo key members of the far-right Proud Boys group testified Tuesday hoping to prove their innocence in the seditious conspiracy case against them for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, while admitting some of their actions were wrong.\n\nZachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola both acknowledged their wrongdoing when they breached the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, during the riot.\n\n\"I basically trespassed through all the breaches,\" Pezzola testified, describing how he pushed his way through multiple police lines before entering the building.\n\nPezzola, who also goes by the nickname \"Spaz,\" admitted to using a police officer's riot shield to smash a Capitol building window and then trespassing in the building for more than 20 minutes.\n\nAsked by his attorney why he decided to take the stand, Pezzola said, \"to take responsibility\" for what he did on Jan. 6 and explain that his co-defendants were not involved in many of his actions.\n\nPezzola and Rehl, along with three other Proud Boys leaders, are charged with seditious conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and actual obstruction of the 2020 election certification, as well as assaulting, resisting or impeding officers and destruction of government property.\n\nPezzola faces an additional charge of robbery for allegedly stealing the riot shield he used to smash the window. He denied the allegation on Tuesday, saying he got the shield from someone else.\n\nFederal prosecutors seeking to discredit Rehl, president of the group's Philadelphia chapter, presented video evidence that they suggested showed Rehl macing police at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nOver the course of his own testimony, Rehl repeatedly said under oath that he did not assault officers. He is not charged with assaulting officers with a chemical spray.\n\nAsked directly by Assistant U.S. Attorney Erik Kenerson if he was \"spraying at police officers,\" Rehl responded: \"Not that I recall.\"\n\nKenerson showed the jury multiple camera angles of a person wearing what he suggested was identical attire to Rehl moving through the crowd. Rehl said he could not confirm the person was him. Images of the person were obscured and low resolution as Kenerson moved frame by frame through the sequence.\n\n\"It's a really grainy video,\" Rehl said, adding at one point that he could not \"confirm or deny\" the person was him.\n\nRehl has been testifying over the past week in the seditious conspiracy case against him. The jury trial has dragged on for months with a variety of tedious procedural hurdles since jury selection began in December.\n\nResponding to questions from his attorney Carmen Hernandez last week, Rehl cast the Proud Boys as a rowdy social club - a stark contrast from prosecutors' characterization of the group as a far-right militia intent on overthrowing the U.S. government.\n\n\"Yeah, we'd party ... we'd go get lit,\" Rehl said in reference to social gatherings the group had after attending a protest. The parties at times were unrelated to any protests, Rehl said, referring to the group's occasional travel to Las Vegas.\n\n\"We go out there and we just get trashed all weekend,\" Rehl said. \"We get drunk. We gamble. We meet other guys from other chapters. It's a great time.\"\n\nTo close out his testimony, Rehl apologized to members of the jury, \"if you believe I did anything wrong that day.\" He acknowledged he should not have entered the Capitol building and said it was a mistake to have smoked a cigarette in the building.\n\n\"It was a terrible day,\" Rehl said. \"A lot of bad stuff happened.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio sentenced to 22 years for role in Jan. 6 attack\n\n\"I will have to live with that shame ... for the rest of my life,\" Tarrio said.\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday sentenced former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio to 22 years in prison -- the longest sentence to date handed down for any individual charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nProsecutors had sought 33 years in prison for Tarrio, their harshest recommendation yet for someone charged in the Justice Department's sweeping investigation into the Capitol assault -- despite the fact that Tarrio wasn't present in Washington the day of the attack.\n\nIn their sentencing recommendation, prosecutors described Tarrio as a \"naturally charismatic leader\" and \"a savvy propagandist\" who used his influence over hundreds of followers to orchestrate an assault on democracy -- for which he was convicted of seditious conspiracy and several other felonies.\n\n\"This defendant, and his co-conspirators targeted our entire system of government,\" assistant U.S. Attorney Conor Mulroe said during Tuesday's hearing. \"This offense involved calculation and deliberation. We need to make sure that the consequences are abundantly clear to anyone who might be unhappy with the results in 2024, 2028, 2032 or any future election for as long as this case is remembered.\"\n\nProsecutors argued Tarrio helped rally members of the far-right group to come to Washington in advance of Jan. 6 with the goal of stopping the peaceful transition of power, that he monitored their movements and egged them on as they attacked the Capitol, and continued to celebrate their actions in the days after the insurrection.\n\nThey also pointed to a nine-page strategic plan to \"storm\" government buildings in Washington on Jan. 6 that was found in Tarrio's possession after the riot, as well as violent rhetoric he routinely used in messages with other members of the group about what they would do if Congress moved forward in certifying President Joe Biden's election win.\n\nTarrio's attorneys contended that the government overstated his intentions with respect to Jan. 6, and that his real goal rallying members of the group to Washington, D.C., was to confront protesters from the far-left Antifa movement. They also argued he never directed any of his followers' movements during the riot itself and that he otherwise had no ability to control members who became violent during the riot.\n\n\"My client is no terrorist. My client is a misguided patriot, that's what my client is,\" Tarrio's attorney Sabino Jauregui said. \"He was trying to protect this country, as misguided as he was.\"\n\nTarrio also spoke at the hearing, apologizing profusely for his actions and heaping praise on members of law enforcement who he said have been unfairly mistreated and maligned after the Jan. 6 attack -- which he called a \"national embarrassment.\"\n\n\"I will have to live with that shame and disappointment for the rest of my life,\" Tarrio said. \"We invoked 1776 and the Constitution of the United States and that was so wrong to do. That was a perversion. The events of Jan. 6 is something that should never be celebrated.\"\n\nAs he did in the sentencings for Tarrio's four other co-defendants, U.S. District Judge Tim Kelly departed significantly below what the federal guidelines called for in issuing his ultimate sentence -- even as he accepted the government's recommendation to apply the so-called 'terrorism enhancement' that effectively labeled Tarrio's crimes as domestic terrorism.\n\nJust before handing down his sentence, Judge Kelly reflected somberly on the events of Jan. 6 and its impact on democracy.\n\n\"I do think the evidence supports the inference that Mr. Tarrio was the ultimate leader [of the conspiracy],\" Kelly said. \"The people he assembled, the people that were there, again, played critical roles ... they played important roles at breach after breach after breach.\"\n\nJudge Kelly also went well below the sentencing guidelines in his prison terms handed down last week to Proud Boys leaders Joseph Biggs, who was sentenced to 17 years in prison, Zachary Rehl, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and Ethan Nordean, who received 18 years in prison -- matching the previous longest sentence to date handed down in connection with the Capitol attack to Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes.\n\nDominic Pezzola, the sole defendant charged in the case who was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but who was convicted of several other major felonies, was sentenced last Friday to 10 years in prison.\n\nKelly has explained his decisions to sentence the Proud Boys below what the federal sentencing guidelines called for is based on his belief that previous decades-long sentences handed down to individuals convicted of seditious conspiracy was typically for cases where a defendant either intended or their actions directly resulted in loss of life.\n\n\"The defendants understood the stakes, and they embraced their role in bringing about a 'revolution,'\" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum earlier this month for Tarrio and the other Proud Boys. \"They unleashed a force on the Capitol that was calculated to exert their political will on elected officials by force and to undo the results of a democratic election. The foot soldiers of the right aimed to keep their leader in power. They failed. They are not heroes; they are criminals.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Unlike the other defendants in this trial, Pezzola is not alleged to have a leadership position in the organization and was inactive in Proud Boys group chats.\n\nAll five defendants were found guilty of other charges related to January 6, including: obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging any duties; obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder; and destruction of government property and aiding and abetting.\n\nEach of the defendants were convicted of at least one charge that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence, and could face a lengthy amount of time behind bars. A sentencing date for the five defendants has not yet been scheduled. District Judge Timothy Kelly said it is likely to happen in late July.\n\nThe jury did not reach a verdict with regards to some defendants on charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers as well as destruction of government property and aiding and abetting. A mistrial was declared on those counts.\n\nIn court, as each juror was polled, Tarrio - dressed in a three-piece suit - peered over the desk, straining his neck to watch the jury. Rehl shook his head as he was convicted of seditious conspiracy while the others sat still in their chairs.\n\nAfter the jurors left, several defendants and attorneys shook hands, hugged, and exchanged brief words. Family for the defendants cried together in a hallway outside the courtroom.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the verdict \"makes clear that the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy.\"\n\n\"The evidence presented at trial detailed the extent of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, and the central role these defendants played in setting into motion the unlawful events of that day,\" he told reporters at the Justice Department.\n\nRelated article US Capitol rioter who barged into Pelosi's offices sentenced to three years in prison\n\nGarland said that the DOJ's massive investigation into the Capitol riot \"has secured more than 600 convictions for a wide range of criminal conduct\" during the attack and in the days leading up to it.\n\nLawyers for some of the defendants provided mixed reactions to reporters outside the courthouse, with Tarrio's attorney, Nayib Hassan, saying that although he did not agree with the jury's decision, he respected it.\n\n\"At this point in time we're currently drafting all the appellate paperwork to proceed forward,\" Hassan said.\n\nSteven Metcalf, a defense attorney for Pezzola, said he, too, would be appealing the verdict, but praised the jury for acquitting Pezzola of seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"Dominic Pezzola was ultimately separated from the seditious conspiracy charge,\" Metcalf said. \"Which is what I set out to do over a year and a half ago and which I was able to accomplish.\"\n\nAsked how Rehl was feeling, attorney Carmen Hernandez told reporters that her client was \"not happy.\"\n\n\"This week is his wife's birthday, his wedding anniversary, his little girl will be two years old in June. It's not a happy day,\" she said.\n\n\"We're very disappointed,\" Hernandez said. \"I don't believe he committed seditious conspiracy ... but the jury has spoken and that's our system of justice. I'm very disappointed in the verdict.\"\n\nNick Smith, who represents Nordean, declined to comment on the verdict to reporters inside the courthouse. Biggs' attorney, Norman Pattis, also declined to comment, but later said on Twitter, \"It was a difficult trial. The appeal is promising. Much love to the Boys and their supporters.\"\n\nThe conviction of Tarrio is especially significant, even though he was not in Washington, DC, on January 6. According to the indictment, the Proud Boys leader helped to create a command structure within the Proud Boys in the lead up to January 6.\n\nText and Signal messages highlighted in the indictment suggest that Tarrio was preparing for a \"revolution,\" and reviewed documents that set forth a plan to occupy a few \"crucial buildings\" in Washington, including House and Senate office buildings around the Capitol.\n\nTarrio was arrested on January 4, 2021, for bringing high-capacity rifle magazines to DC and ordered to leave the city.\n\nDuring the trial, using messages and videos posted by the defendants and other members of the group, prosecutors laid out the case that the Proud Boys, animated by Trump and his election lies after the 2020 defeat, began calling for violence and revolution against the incoming Biden presidency.\n\nMembers of the group saw Biden and others on the left as a threat to the country, according to prosecutors, and messaged one another about the need for \"war,\" \"revolution,\" and firing squads for traitors.\n\nOn January 6, prosecutors said, many of the defendants didn't attend Trump's speech that day but instead began a march to the Capitol.\n\nRelated article Opinion: Trump's risky call for protests\n\nProud Boys were at the front lines of the mob on Capitol grounds and were there when the first barriers were breached. Prosecutors have alleged that leaders of the group riled members up and communicated with them, through hand signals, to move ahead.\n\nAfter rioters had arrived at Senate wing doors of the Capitol building, Pezzola used a police riot shield he stole during the attack to break open a window, prosecutors said, which rioters entered the Capitol through.\n\nDefense attorneys have argued that their clients never had a plan to storm the Capitol and stop the electoral college vote that day. The messages and videos show nothing more than stupid, vulgar rhetoric, defense attorneys said, hardly a seditious plot against the US government.\n\nOften teetering into disarray with legal battles, evidentiary disputes, sealed hearings, countless calls for a mistrial and several shouting matches with the judge, the trial concluded last Tuesday with the final closing arguments from defense counsel and federal prosecutors.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors listened to testimony from multiple officers who defended the Capitol on January 6 as well as FBI agents who investigated the Proud Boys and testimony from several Proud Boys members, including two of the defendants, none of whom said there was ever a specific plan to take the Capitol.\n\nThe countless delays, brought on by newly unveiled evidence and informants, a juror who believed they were being followed, and internecine squabbles among attorneys pushed a trial originally estimated to last five to seven weeks to stretch across four months.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Oath Keepers members found guilty of seditious conspiracy\n\nThree members of the Oath Keepers and a fourth person associated with the far-right militia group were convicted of seditious conspiracy by a Washington, DC, jury on Monday for their role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection .\n\nThe four men - Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel and Edward Vallejo - were accused of plotting to stop the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 electoral college victory, a conspiracy that culminated in the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nRelated article Man who rested feet on desk in Pelosi's office on Jan. 6 found guilty on 8 counts\n\nThe convictions are another win for the Justice Department who brought the rare charge against members of the far-right militia early last year. After a 10-week trial this fall, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes as well as Kelly Meggs, a leader of the group in Florida, were the first of the group to be found guilty of seditious conspiracy.\n\nA sentencing date was not set, but all four defendants will be placed on house arrest until they are sentenced, Judge Amit Mehta said Monday. They cannot have firearms in their house, and all four will have limitations on their phone communications and internet use.\n\nThe defendants on trial in the case were Minuta, an Oath Keeper from New Jersey who prosecutors described as one of Rhodes' \"most trusted men\"; Hackett, an alleged recruiter for the Florida Oath Keeper who prosecutors said is talented at hiding his identity; Moerschel, an alleged part of the so-called stack formation that prosecutors said acted as a \"battering ram,\" pushing through the mob and into the Capitol; and Vallejo, one of the alleged leaders of the armed quick reaction force, who prosecutors said called for \"guerilla war\" the morning of January 6.\n\nIn addition to the seditious conspiracy charges, Minuta, Hackett, Moerschel and Vallejo were also found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting, as well as conspiracy to prevent a member of Congress from discharging their official duties.\n\nHackett was found guilty of tampering with documents or proceedings.\n\nHackett and Moerschel were found not guilty of destruction of government property. Minuta and Moerschel were found not guilty of tampering with documents or proceedings.\n\nJury deliberations in the case began last week, after prosecutor Louis Manzo, during his closing arguments, walked the jury through weeks of trial testimony and told the jurors to ignore defense attorneys' arguments that the four men are innocent because they were merely following Rhodes.\n\nRelated article 'Victory smoke in the Capitol, boys,' Proud Boys member said on Jan. 6, prosecutors say as trial begins\n\nIn their own closing arguments, defense attorneys for the four men argued that their clients had not conspired together to stop a Biden presidency, saying that the government's case presented no proof of a plan to storm the US Capitol. The attorneys also repeatedly argued that not only was the government manipulating evidence but that there was no proof of a conspiracy between the group, saying that while the jury might find statements from their clients offensive, that wasn't reason to convict them of plotting to stop the certification of the election.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Here's what 'insurrection,' 'coup' and 'sedition' mean\n\nAs the House January 6 committee continues its probe into the US Capitol riot and issues subpoenas, there are questions surrounding the role allies of former President Donald Trump may have played.\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who could face criminal contempt of Congress charges for no longer cooperating with the House committee's investigation, \"exchanged text messages with, and provided guidance to, an organizer of the January 6th rally on the Ellipse after the organizer told him that '[t]hings have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction,\" according to the panel .\n\nMeadows is one of several Trump allies and rally organizers who have been subpoenaed in recent weeks, and he alleges that the subpoenas are \"overly broad and unduly burdensome.\" He also claims that the committee \"lacks lawful authority to seek and to obtain\" the information requested.\n\nMeadows previously turned over around 6,000 pages of documents to the committee, including emails from his personal account.\n\nAnd while a flurry of rioters have also been sentenced to jail time and proceedings continue against other defendants, various words to refer to what took place on January 6 - \"insurrection,\" \"sedition\" and \"coup\" - have been brought up and debated.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what those terms mean.\n\nThe words \"insurrection\" and \"insurrectionists\" have been widely used by news outlets and others to define the storming of the Capitol building and the rioters involved.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster , \"insurrection\" is the \"act of revolting against civil authority or an established government.\" Other definitions, like that of the Cambridge Dictionary, specify the act is usually a violent one . Synonyms include \"revolt\" or \"uprising,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nInsurrection, or rebellion, is a crime under Title 18 of the US Code , punishable by a fine, a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, or both. Being found guilty of insurrection also makes someone ineligible to hold office in the United States.\n\n\"What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States,\" Sen. Mitt Romney , Republican of Utah, said in his remarks on the Senate floor after the Capitol was secured.\n\nOther Republicans have downplayed the violence at the US Capitol or denied anything violent occurred, including Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert , who said there is no evidence it was \"an armed insurrection.\"\n\n\"Sedition\" is the \"incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority,\" according to Merriam-Webster .\n\nSimilar to insurrection, the act of sedition is also a crime under the US Code, which characterizes it as two or more people who conspire to overthrow the US government, or \"prevent, hinder, or delay the execution\" of US law by force. It's punishable by a fine and up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged 11 defendants with seditious conspiracy related to the Capitol attack, including the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes.\n\nThe department until now had been careful not to push the idea of sedition, instead charging defendants affiliated with right-wing groups with conspiracy to obstruct the congressional proceeding on January 6. The seditious conspiracy charge carries the same possible consequence as an obstruction charge, but is rarely used, politically loaded and has been difficult for the Justice Department to use successfully against defendants in the past.\n\nPreviously, some Biden administration officials believed using the sedition charge could politicize the Justice Department's prosecution of the Capitol attackers, and the department recoiled after the former top prosecutor over the investigation, Michael Sherwin, said on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" he believed seditious conspiracy could be charged.\n\nSome elected officials have leveled the accusation of sedition squarely at Trump, including two Democrats: former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Sam Liccardo, mayor of San Jose, California, and a former federal prosecutor. In a January 2021 statement , Liccardo said that Trump \"should be tried for sedition.\"\n\nA \"coup,\" shorthand for \"coup d'état,\" is broadly characterized by Merriam-Webster as a \"sudden decisive exercise of force in politics,\" but particularly the \"violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group.\"\n\nSome have described the event as a \"failed\" or \"attempted\" coup, since apparent efforts to overturn the presidential election have been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We must call today's violence what it actually is: a failed attempt at a coup,\" then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, wrote in a January 2021 statement.\n\nRetired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a key witness in the impeachment hearings against Trump, previously told CNN's Anderson Cooper he thought the events at the Capitol could be categorized as a \"failed coup.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Zachary Cohen, Katelyn Polantz and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Oath Keepers leader and associates convicted of multiple charges in seditious conspiracy case\n\nA Washington, DC, jury on Tuesday convicted Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and associate Kelly Meggs of seditious conspiracy for their role around the January 6, 2021 , attack on the US Capitol.\n\nWhile the jury split on a number of other charges brought against the five alleged members of the right-wing militia group, even two guilty verdicts on the seditious conspiracy charge marked a significant win for the Justice Department and was hailed as vindication by the House select committee investigating the insurrection. The historic criminal trial - the first of three seditious conspiracy cases set to start this year - was a major test of the department's ability to hold January 6 rioters accountable.\n\nThe charge has rarely been brought in the century and a half that the statute and its forerunners have been on the books. By using it against members of the Oath Keepers the department is expressing that it sees the breach of the Capitol as a grave threat to the operation of the US government.\n\nRelated article Stewart Rhodes and fellow member of Oath Keepers found guilty of sedition\n\nProsecutors had argued that the attack on the US Capitol was more than just a political protest that got out of control, but rather a violent attack on the seat of American democracy and an effort to keep Joe Biden out of the Oval Office by any means necessary.\n\n\"The FBI will always uphold the rights of all citizens who peacefully engage in First Amendment protected activities, but we and our partners will continue to hold accountable those who engaged in illegal acts regarding the January 6, 2021, siege on the US Capitol,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged that the Oath Keepers members - Rhodes, Meggs, Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell - conspired to forcibly stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power from then-President Donald Trump to Biden and plotted to attack the US Capitol.\n\nJurors considered 10 charges against the five defendants, including three conspiracy charges, obstructing the certification of the electoral college vote and tampering with documents. The defendants were convicted on multiple charges, and all five were found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding. The charge, like the seditious conspiracy charge, carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much time each defendant will serve, as Judge Amit Mehta could issue a sentence that exceeds 20 years or decide to sentence them to far less than the allowed maximum.\n\nMehta said in court that four of the defendants, including Rhodes, will remain behind bars. Only one defendant - Caldwell - had been on pretrial release.\n\nSentencing hearings typically occur 90 days after a verdict is reached.\n\nLawyers for the defendants said they were disappointed in the verdict but believed their clients had received a fair trial.\n\n\"I do believe that they gave us a fair trial,\" James Lee Bright, an attorney for Rhodes, told reporters outside the courthouse. Bright added, however, that he believed the verdict \"could have been substantially different\" if the trial had been moved outside of Washington, DC.\n\nAs the verdict was being read in the federal courtroom, the five defendants expressed little emotion. Rhodes, who founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 and has led the group ever since, had his head down, writing notes to one of his attorneys.\n\nMembers of the prosecution congratulated each other after the jury had left, but declined to commented on the verdict. They said the 57-year-old Rhodes had stood outside the Capitol on January 6 acting like a \"general\" as his followers breached the building.\n\nMeggs, 53, is a leader of the Oath Keepers' Florida chapter and, according to the government, led the infamous \"stack\" formation of Oath Keepers inside the Capitol on January 6.

      "text": "Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio sentenced to 22 years in prison, longest for a January 6 defendant\n\nFormer Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio was sentenced Tuesday to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and leading a failed plot to prevent the transfer of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.\n\nThe sentence from District Judge Timothy Kelly is the longest given to anyone in relation to the January 6, 2021 , US Capitol attack.\n\nTarrio, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and orange slip-on sneakers, leaned against a lectern at the front of the crowded courtroom and hung his head as the judge handed down his lengthy sentence. Three other members of Proud Boys leadership were also found guilty of seditious conspiracy and sentenced last week.\n\nRelated article 'Don't freak out': Notes from defense table during the Proud Boys seditious conspiracy trial\n\n\"It is kind of hard to put into words how important the peaceful transfer of power is,\" Kelly said. \"Our country was founded as an experiment in self-government by the people, but it cannot long endure if the way we elect our leaders is threatened with force and violence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tarrio was the ultimate leader, the ultimate person who organized, who was motivated by revolutionary zeal,\" Kelly said at the end of the three hour hearing, adding that he has shown \"no remorse.\"\n\n\"What happened that day did not honor the founders, it was the kind of thing they wrote the Constitution to prevent,\" the judge said.\n\nTarrio's lawyer, Nayib Hassan, told reporters outside of the courthouse that they \"respectfully disagree\" with the judge's decision.\n\n\"It caught us off guard,\" Hassan said, adding: \"That's what the appellate process is for.\"\n\nTarrio had been arrested in Washington, DC, days before the riot for burning a DC church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high-capacity rifle magazines into the district, and was ordered by a judge to leave the city.\n\nBut Kelly said that while Tarrio may not have been present at the Capitol during the attack, the Proud Boys leader \"had an outsized impact on the events of the day. \"\n\nWhile the 22-year sentence is the longest for any January 6 defendant, the Justice Department had sought 33 years in prison for Tarrio.\n\nKelly had consistently gone far below previous Justice Department sentencing requests for Proud Boys members convicted in this case.\n\nKelly sentenced Ethan Nordean and Joseph Biggs, two of the far-right organization's top lieutenants, to 18- and 17-year prison sentences, respectively. Zachary Rehl, a local Proud Boys chapter leader, was sentenced to 15 years behind bars, while Dominic Pezzola, a low-level member and the only defendant acquitted of the seditious conspiracy charge, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nBefore he was sentenced, Tarrio apologized for the \"pain and suffering\" that law enforcement, legislators, and others suffered on January 6, and vowed to have \"nothing to do with politics, groups, activism or rallies.\"\n\n\"I have always tried to hold myself to a higher standard and I failed,\" he said. \"I held myself morally above others, and this trial has shown me how wrong I was.\"\n\nStanding before the judge, Tarrio said that he \"spent the last year and a half trying to figure out how I ended up at this podium. On November 3, 2020, something that I never expected happened - my candidate lost. I felt like something was personally stolen from me. Every media channel that I turned to told me I was justified.\"\n\nBut, Tarrio said, he was against the violence that erupted at the Capitol: \"I am not a political zealot. Inflicting harm or changing the outcome of the election was not my goal.\"\n\nProsecutor Conor Mulroe slammed Tarrio, saying that the Proud Boys leader had a \"toxic ability to control others\" and was the \"leader of this conspiracy\" that \"targeted our entire system of government.\"\n\nMulroe described Tarrio as someone with a \"toxic ability to control others\" who \"increased his own fame and stature by fanning the flame of violence, political violence.\"\n\n\"These are men who would never strap a bomb to their chest or sign up for a training camp, but they are thrilled by the notion of traveling from city to city and beating their advisories senseless in a street fight,\" Mulroe said.\n\nThe Proud Boys organization, led by Tarrio, \"were not just a drop in the bucket\" when it comes to the violence on January 6, Mulroe said. The group \"had an integral role in that first breach\" at the Capitol, Mulroe said. \"The actions of that group were absolutely pivotal on January 6 and followed directly the plotting and planning of Enrique Tarrio.\"\n\nTarrio's lawyer Sabino Jauregui fiercely fought additional terrorism sentencing penalties Tuesday, saying that \"it was not his intention to bring down the United States government, or overthrow the United States government.\"\n\nRelated article Two Proud Boys sentenced for roles in Capitol attack on January 6\n\n\"My client is no terrorist,\" Jauregui said. \"My client is a misguided patriot. That's what my client is. This is not some foreign national waging war against the United States - he thought he was saving this country, saving this republic.\"\n\nDuring the months-long trial, prosecutors showed evidence that Tarrio helped to create a command structure within the Proud Boys in the lead up to January 6 that dictated how members of the organization would work when attending high-profile rallies.\n\nThough he was not in Washington, DC, on January 6, Tarrio expressed his support for the rioters online and was in touch with his co-defendants on the ground, prosecutors said.\n\nBiggs and Nordean, who assumed leadership in Tarrio's absence, led the charge at the Capitol, prosecutors said. The Proud Boys were at the front of the mob, breaking past barriers and the police line and smashing windows to let rioters inside the historic building in the first breaches that eventually led to Congress evacuating and temporarily halting the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Jack Forrest contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Proud Boys were 'Donald Trump's army,' prosecutor says in closing arguments of seditious conspiracy trial\n\nAfter months of legal battles, infighting between defense lawyers and dozens of rejected mistrial motions, the federal criminal trial against five Proud Boys accused of plotting to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, moved to its final stage Monday.\n\nOne prosecutor and two defense attorneys gave their closing arguments to the Washington, DC, jury tasked with deciding whether Enrique Tarrio, Dominic Pezzola, Zachary Rehl, Joseph Biggs and Ethan Nordean are guilty of several federal crimes, including seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe Justice Department's Conor Mulroe argued that the defendants stirred fellow members of the far-right Proud Boys toward violence in the lead up to January 6 and directed them that day to attack the iconic building.\n\nRelated article Proud Boy testifies in sedition trial about far-right group being the 'tip of the spear' on January 6\n\nAttorneys for Nordean and Rehl repeatedly said that the mountains of evidence only showed vulgar, stupid messages from their clients and violence from others in the crowd on January 6 - none of which amounted to the seditious conspiracy charge their clients face.\n\nAll five of the defendants have pleaded not guilty. Closing arguments are expected to continue into Tuesday.\n\nIn the lead-up to January 6, Mulroe argued, the defendants were infuriated by then-President Donald Trump's 2020 election loss and began calling for revolutionary action to oppose the incoming administration.\n\n\"The founders of this country fought to create a nation where the leader is chosen by the will of the people and power is handed over peacefully following a process of law,\" Mulroe said. \"These defendants saw themselves as Donald Trump's army, fighting to keep their leader in power no matter what the law or the courts had to say about it.\"\n\nMulroe showed the jury countless messages and videos the defendants sent to one another in the weeks and months before the attack, calling for violence against politicians, police and left-wingers, arguing the five men \"had been thirsting for violence and organizing for action.\"\n\n\"To these defendants, politics was no longer something for the debating floor or voting booth. To them, politics meant actual physical combat, a battle between good and evil in the most literal sense,\" Mulroe said.\n\n\"The Capitol was the focus from the start,\" he said. \"They made it plain as day why they were there. It was not to see Donald Trump's speech, it was not to protect patriots, it was certainly not to protest peacefully. They were there to threaten and, if necessary, use force to stop the certification of the election.\"\n\nRelated article Judge in Proud Boys case denies mistrial motion after jurors report being followed\n\nAs the attack unfolded, Mulroe said, several of the defendants took part in breaking down police barriers, signaled directions to one another, and at a critical moment when police had reestablished a line in front of the Capitol, the men pressed forward.\n\nPlaying the jury audio clips of panicked US Capitol Police officers begging for backup as the mob breached the Capitol grounds, Mulroe said, \"That is what it looks like when the process of government is brought to a screeching halt. Those radio calls are the sound of a 200-year tradition of the peaceful transfer of power being shattered.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ladies and gentlemen, this was a national disgrace. To them, it was mission accomplished. They had done it. They had stopped the certification.\"\n\nBut in the days after the riot, Mulroe said, and the defendants became angry more wasn't done to keep Trump in power.\n\n\"They came up short,\" Mulroe added. \"So now, they are facing consequences.\"\n\nDefense attorneys told jurors their clients never entered a conspiracy to attack the Capitol and chided prosecutors for trying to connect their clients to Trump.\n\nNordean's attorney, Nicholas Smith, argued that prosecutors only used the infamous video from a 2020 debate stage where Trump told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" to rile up the jury.\n\n\"It was played to manipulate you into confusing your dislike for a politician with whether these men are guilty of a crime,\" Smith said. \"Whatever the former president's personal crimes are, you have seen no evidence that Mr. Trump conspired with Ethan Nordean from Seattle.\"\n\nThe prosecutors' case, Smith said, \"was designed to make you hate these men and find them fearful,\" adding that several of the statements shown by prosecutors were from before January 6 and that videos of violence between Proud Boys and others played for the jury were from past rallies immediately after the 2020 election.\n\n\"The loud sounds and scary and chaotic scenes\" from those rallies, Smith argued, were tactic by prosecutors. \"It was designed to make you hate these men and find them fearful,\" he said.\n\nSmith and Carmen Hernandez, who represents Rehl, argued there was not a single message, video or statement from the defendants outlining a specific plan to stop Congress' certification of the 2020 presidential election on January 6.\n\nHernandez also rebuked the \"mountain of evidence\" prosecutors showed as inflammatory, saying that \"much of it, in my humble opinion, (had) nothing to do with Mr. Rehl.\"\n\n\"We think these guys are racist and sexist,\" Carmen said, pointing at the five defendants sitting in the courtroom, \"and they may be. But that's not what they're charged with. Even if you don't like what some of them say, it doesn't make them guilty.\"\n\nRelated article Tucker Carlson out at Fox News\n\nProsecutors looked at over \"half a million\" messages between members of the Proud Boys organization, Hernandez said, including some from the defendants, and \"there is not a single message where they wrote the plan is to go attach the Capitol and take it down. There is a lot of trash talk ... but not once in 500,000 messages.\"\n\nBoth Hernandez and Smith told jurors that while their clients acted inappropriately, neither of them had come to Washington, DC, as part of an explicit plan for violence in the Capitol.\n\n\"Were not debating for a second that it wasn't inappropriate for a person to go into the Capitol building, of course it was,\" Smith said, adding that Nordean \"should not have gone into the Capitol. He should not have been where he was.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

      "text": "The Oath Keepers trial is a major test of the Justice Department's ability to hold Jan. 6 rioters accountable. Here's how it has gone\n\nThe historic seditious conspiracy trial of five alleged Oath Keepers - a closely watched test of how the Justice Department is prosecuting US Capitol rioters - is now with the jury.\n\nThe trial began more than seven weeks ago and has featured hundreds of messages, audio recordings , and videos of the defendants' revolutionary rhetoric in the wake of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential victory, and of their actions as they traversed the US Capitol grounds during the riot on January 6, 2021.\n\nRelated article Oath Keepers spent over $400 at post-US Capitol riot feast at the Olive Garden, prosecutors say\n\nDefense attorneys argued that that there was no uniformed plan among the group, that the far-right Oath Keepers militia group only attended the Stop the Steal rally to provide security details for speakers, and that the inflammatory recordings of the defendants were nothing more than \"locker room talk.\"\n\nStewart Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins and Thomas Caldwell have all pleaded not guilty.\n\nHere's what to know about the case:\n\nStewart Rhodes , 57, founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 and has led the group ever since. Prosecutors say Rhodes stood outside the Capitol on January 6 acting like a \"general\" as his followers breached the building.\n\nKelly Meggs , 53, is a leader of the Oath Keepers' Florida chapter and, according to the government, led the infamous \"stack\" formation of Oath Keepers inside the Capitol on January 6.\n\nKenneth Harrelson , 41, is also a Florida Oath Keeper and allegedly acted as Meggs' right-hand man on January 6.\n\nJessica Watkins , 40, led her own militia in Ohio before joining the Oath Keepers in the wake of the 2020 election. Prosecutors say Watkins, who is transgender, allegedly entered the Capitol with Harrelson and Meggs and coordinated with Caldwell in the weeks prior.\n\nThomas Caldwell , a 68-year-old who testified that he is not a member of the Oath Keepers, allegedly helped organize the armed quick reaction force stationed outside of DC on January 6. Caldwell also hosted Oath Keepers at his Virginia farm, prosecutors say, and communicated with Watkins during the riot.\n\nJurors will consider 10 charges against the defendants including three conspiracy charges, obstructing the certification of the electoral college vote, and tampering with documents.\n\nSeditious conspiracy : All five defendants are accused of planning to use force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power on January 6.\n\nConspiracy to Obstruct and Obstructing an Official Proceeding : The defendants are all facing charges alleging that they conspired together to, and did, stop Congress from certifying the electoral college votes inside the Capitol.\n\nConspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging any duties : This charge also relates to the certification of the electoral college vote. The indictment alleges that all five defendants worked together to \"prevent by force, intimidation, and threat... Members of the United States Congress, from discharging any duties,\" namely, certifying the election.\n\nDestruction of Government Property and Aiding and Abetting : Meggs, Harrelson and Watkins, according to prosecutors, were part of a crowd that burst through the Capitol's Rotunda doors on January 6. They are not alleged to have broken the doors themselves.\n\nCivil Disorder and Aiding and Abetting : Jurors will consider whether Jessica Watkins interfered with law enforcement when she allegedly joined a crowd near the Senate chamber, pushed against and shouted at officers who were guarding the chamber doors.\n\nTampering with Documents or Proceedings and Aiding and Abetting : Rhodes, Meggs, Harrelson and Caldwell are each facing charges for allegedly deleting messages and pictures from their phones or social media accounts after January 6. Prosecutors also allege that Rhodes instructed other Oath Keepers to delete messages after the riot.\n\nMultiple current and former members of the group have taken the stand, offering a glimpse into how online conspiracy theories in the wake of the 2020 election pushed some to join the Oath Keepers and take action on January 6.\n\nGraydon Young, an Oath Keeper who has pleaded guilty to January 6 charges, testified that he felt \"desperation and hopelessness\" after the 2020 election, and feared that nothing would stop a \"fraud\" from being committed on the American people. So, Young said, he joined the Oath Keepers as a means to fight back.\n\n\"I guess I was acting like a traitor against my own government,\" Young, who entered the Capitol that day, told the jury. Young said the group had an implicit plan to storm the Capitol but was never directly told to enter.\n\nRelated article 'I was acting like a traitor'; second cooperating Oath Keeper testifies in sedition trial\n\nAnother Oath Keeper who pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors, Jason Dolan , described a similar descent into hopelessness after the 2020 election.\n\n\"I wanted [lawmakers] to hear and feel the same things I was feeling at the time,\" Dolan testified, watching a video of himself and Harrelson chant \"treason\" as they walked through the Capitol that day. \"It felt like I have been betrayed. I wanted them to hear and feel the anger, the frustration, the rage that I felt.\"\n\nThree of the defendants, Rhodes, Caldwell and Watkins, also testified during the trial, downplaying their unhinged messages and arguing that there was no plan to invade the city with weapons.\n\nRhodes described to the jury why he believed the 2020 election was \"unconstitutional,\" and testified that he wanted then-President Donald Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to stop the election from being certified. Rhodes claimed he never gave orders for members to go inside the Capitol and spent most of the day trying to gather Oath Keepers in one place.\n\nProsecutors also revealed new private messages between Oath Keepers and secretly recorded meetings of the group allegedly calling for violence , including one recording just days after the riot in which Rhodes said he wished he brought rifles to the Capitol that day and warned of \"combat here on US soil.\"\n\nOther defendants also complained that the riot wasn't more successful, prosecutors said, noting how much danger lawmakers and police in the Capitol faced that day.\n\nYoung recounted a conversation he had with a group of Oath Keepers, including Kenneth Harrelson, after they left the Capitol. Harrelson said the police equipment would have been \"ineffective\" against firearms, Young told the jury.\n\n\"The whole general context was that if we had been more geared up or prepared, we might have been able to get through,\" Young testified.\n\nRelated article Oath Keepers leader testifies 2020 election was 'unconstitutional,' paints himself as anti-violence\n\nCaldwell also lamented not having enough firepower, prosecutors allege, writing in a Facebook message that evening that \"If we'd had guns I guarantee we would have killed 100 politicians. They ran off and were spirited away through their underground tunnels like the rats they were.\"\n\nMeggs, too, allegedly celebrated the violence in messages. Prosecutors say that when an acquaintance told Meggs he \"was hoping to see Nancy's head rolling down the front steps,\" Meggs, who can be seen in security footage outside Pelosi's office that day, responded, \"We looked forward [sic] her.\"\n\nThe trial - the first of three seditious conspiracy cases set to start this year - is a major test of the Justice Department's theory that far-right extremist groups plotted to disrupt America's longstanding tradition of a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge is politically risky and notoriously difficult to prove. Cases are brought infrequently, and prosecutors haven't won a conviction on the charge in decades.\n\nIf prosecutors do manage to secure a seditious conspiracy conviction, it could help rebut criticisms that the Justice Department has not been aggressive enough in prosecuting rioters and help dispel claims that the riot was merely a protest that got out of hand.\n\nRelated article Capitol riot defendant calls himself a 'little bit of a goof' regarding Pelosi and Pence comments\n\nThe verdict could also come with ramifications for a Justice Department increasingly under political fire. When it was unsealed early this year, the indictment against members of the Oath Keepers sparked outrage among some supporters of the former president and figureheads on the right who claimed the allegations were exaggerated and the charges politically motivated.\n\nLaw enforcement leaders have continued to warn of the recent rise in domestic extremist threats from lone actors and small groups, a threat some Republican lawmakers have sought to downplay.\n\nFollowing Trump's presidential campaign announcement last week, the verdict could face further scrutiny down the road. The former president - who told his supporters to go to the Capitol on January 6 - has said that, if elected, he would consider \"full pardons\" for the rioters.\n\nThis story was updated with additional details.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

See their cases in 3 charts\n\n(CNN) - On his first day in office, President Donald Trump granted sweeping clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump pardoned or commuted the sentences of everyone convicted of January 6-related crimes, including hundreds who were guilty of assaulting police . He also ordered the Justice Department to dismiss all pending cases.\n\nThe move was the crowning achievement in Trump's yearslong effort to whitewash the history of January 6, when a mob of thousands of his supporters violently stormed the Capitol and disrupted Congress' certification of the 2020 election, which he lost.\n\nWhen Trump took office, federal prosecutors had already secured convictions in about 80% of the nearly 1,600 charged cases, mostly in the form of guilty pleas. About 300 cases were pending in court when Trump directed the Justice Department to dismiss the charges. Only two defendants were acquitted of all charges.\n\nTrump's pardons and dismissals covered hundreds of people charged with or convicted of violent felony crimes, such as assaulting police officers , using a deadly weapon , participating in a riot and destroying government property.\n\nHe took this step even after senior Republicans like Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson said pardons should not be granted to violent offenders.\n\nWhile Trump pardoned virtually all of the 1,270 convicted rioters, he withheld pardons for now from 14 members of far-right extremist groups that were charged in the most notorious seditious conspiracy cases. But he still granted them commutations, releasing them from federal prison, where they were serving some of the longest January 6 sentences.\n\nThese convicts were members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, and were among the first people to breach the Capitol during the attack. Some were found guilty of seditious conspiracy , while others were acquitted, but all were convicted of other felonies.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The record is the 18-year sentence given to Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, also convicted of seditious conspiracy, after prosecutors sought 25 years in federal prison.\n\nThe government sought 33 years for Biggs, an Army veteran who sustained a head injury in Iraq and then was a correspondent for the conspiracy website Infowars. Prosecutors argued that he was a \"vocal leader and influential proponent of the group's shift toward political violence\" and that he used his \"outsized public profile\" and his military experience as he \"led a revolt against the government in an effort to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who handed down Biggs' sentence, ruled earlier in the hearing that Biggs' tearing down of a fence between police and rioters qualified him for a terrorism sentencing enhancement sought by prosecutors. Destroying the fence was a \"deliberate, meaningful step\" that contributed to the disruption of the electoral vote count occurring in the Capitol, Kelly said.\n\nBiggs was convicted in May of seditious conspiracy; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to use force, intimidation or threats to prevent officers of the U.S. from discharging their duties; interference with law enforcement during civil disorder; and destruction of government property.\n\nBiggs went to trial alongside Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola . All five were convicted of felonies, and all but Pezzola were convicted of seditious conspiracy. The other Proud Boys were also to be sentenced in the coming days: Rehl on Thursday afternoon, Pezzola and Nordean on Friday and Tarrio on Tuesday.\n\nKelly sentenced Rehl later Thursday afternoon to 15 years in federal prison. Prosecutors had sought 30 years. \"You did spray that officer, and then you lied about it,\" Kelly told Rehl. \"Those are what we call in the law bad facts.\"\n\nIn a selfie video he recorded outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Biggs said, \"January 6th will be a day in infamy.\"\n\nNorm Pattis, an attorney for Biggs, said in closing arguments at trial that the Proud Boys' \"commander-in-chief\" - former President Donald Trump - \"sold them a lie,\" referring to the lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBefore his sentence was handed down Thursday, he said that he was sorry and that he knew he \"messed up\" on Jan. 6.\n\n\"I apologize for my rhetoric,\" Biggs said, adding that he used it as a way to deal with what was going on with his family after a member of their family molested his daughter. \"I'm so sorry. ... I'm not a terrorist. I don't have hate in my heart.\"\n\nBiggs grew emotional as he talked about his daughter, swearing on her life that he intended Jan. 6 to be his last event with the Proud Boys.\n\n\"I'm done with it. I'm sick and tired of left versus right,\" Biggs said. The only group he wants to be affiliated with, he said, is his daughter's PTA.\n\nDuring the government's presentation earlier in the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason McCullough stressed the seriousness of the Proud Boys' actions on Jan. 6, calling them \"among the most serious crimes that this court will consider.\"\n\n\"There's a reason why we will hold our collective breath as we approach future elections,\" McCullough said. \"We never gave it a second thought before Jan. 6.\"\n\nAfter Jan. 6, Americans will think twice about taking children to polling places or attending events like inaugurations, which was what the Proud Boys intended, McCullough said.\n\nPattis, Biggs' lawyer, conceded that his client committed some crimes on Jan. 6 but said they had been \"overstated.\"\n\nThe actions of the Proud Boys on Jan. 6 were \"quintessential political behavior\" up until the riot turned violent, Pattis said, arguing that prosecutors had used his client's political speech as evidence of criminal intent.\n\n\"We have to be careful to count speech for what it is and not what it might do,\" he said.\n\n\"To treat these men as terrorists would be, in my view, the functional equivalent as the destruction of Waco,\" Pattis said, referring to the law enforcement siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993.\n\nDespite applying the terrorism enhancement to Biggs, Kelly agreed that enhancement \"overstates\" Biggs' conduct.\n\n\"It's not my job to label you a terrorist, and my sentence today won't do that, no matter what it is,\" he told Biggs before he delivered the sentence.\n\n\"What happened on Jan. 6 harmed an important American custom that helps support the rule of law and the Constitution,\" he said. \"That day broke our tradition of peacefully transferring power, which is among the most precious things that we had as Americans. Notice I said 'had.' We don't have it anymore.\"\n\nRyan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News.\n\nDaniel Barnes reports for NBC News, based in Washington.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He was given 22 years in prison, the longest Jan. 6 sentence to date, though he was not in Washington for the attack itself. He had been arrested and ordered to stay away from the capital and was convicted of planning and organizing Proud Boys members to assault the Capitol in the lead-up to Jan. 6.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said after their sentencing that Tarrio and his fellow Proud Boys played a \"central role\" in leading the Jan. 6 mob to breach the Capitol.\n\nAt Tarrio's trial, Hassan had blamed Trump for his client's and other Proud Boys' actions, reminding jurors that Trump said his supporters should \"fight like hell\" or they were not \"going to have a country anymore. He also argued that Trump's telling the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" at a 2020 presidential debate brought so much attention to the group that \"vetting became difficult.\"\n\nTarrio was arrested in connection with a separate event - the December 2020 burning of a Black Lives Matter banner - just before the Jan. 6 attack. The top intelligence official in the Washington, D.C., Police Department was convicted two weeks ago of leaking information to Tarrio, telling him just before Jan. 6, 2021, that there was a warrant out in Washington for his arrest.\n\nAs a result, Tarrio watched Jan. 6 unfold from, Hassan said at trial, a \"hotel in Baltimore.\"\n\nMore than 1,580 defendants have been charged and 1,270 have been convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 attack. Trump has not given specifics about how many or what categories of defendants he plans to pardon. In a interview last month on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he did not rule out pardoning rioters who assaulted law enforcement officers.\n\nTrump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tarrio's request for a pardon.\n\nRyan J.

All five defendants were found guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting for their actions on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Rhodes' attorneys said they plan to appeal that conviction.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy case is the most serious to grow out of the Justice Department's sprawling investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack. The two seditious conspiracy verdicts were wins for the department, which has brought forward the relatively rare charges against a number of Oath Keepers, as well as members of the far-right Proud Boys.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland lauded the work of prosecutors and federal agents, saying in a statement that the Justice Department \"is committed to holding accountable those criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy on January 6, 2021.\"\n\nThe not guilty verdicts for three of the defendants could be seen as a sign that jurors did not think the Justice Department proved that Harrelson, Watkins and Caldwell had planned ahead of time to storm the Capitol.\n\nCaldwell's attorney, David Fischer, called the seditious conspiracy acquittal a big win for his client.\n\n\"It obviously was a major victory for Mr. Caldwell...and it was just as obviously a major defeat for the Department of Justice,\" Fischer told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nSome of the most violent rhetoric the government presented during the nearly two-month trial came from the two defendants who were found guilty of seditious conspiracy: Rhodes and Meggs. In evidence presented by the government, both men showed particular disdain for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and talked about their desire to do her violence.\n\nAll three defendants who went inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 - Meggs, Harrelson and Watkins - were found guilty of conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging their official duties. Rhodes and Caldwell were on Capitol grounds that day but did not go inside the building.\n\nWatkins was also found guilty on a count of civil disorder and aiding and abetting because, as she admitted on the stand, she helped push against officers inside the Capitol. Caldwell, who was also found guilty of tampering with documents or proceedings and aiding and abetting, was the only one of the five who was not detained while awaiting trial.\n\nOpening statements in the trial began Oct. 3 , and the jury started deliberating Nov. 22 . Three of the defendants - Rhodes, Caldwell and Watkins - took the stand in their own defense, with Rhodes telling jurors it was \" stupid \" for Oath Keepers to go inside the Capitol.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that the five defendants conspired to oppose the peaceful transfer of power from former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden, but they did not prove that there was a pre-coordinated plot to actually storm the Capitol. Instead, federal prosecutors alleged that those who entered the building - Meggs, Watkins and Harrelson - seized the opportunity when other rioters broke into the Capitol. A federal prosecutor told jurors that a \" sense of entitlement \" had driven the Oath Keepers to storm the building, while another argued that the defendants \"took matters out of the hands of the people and put rifles into their own hands.\"\n\n\"They claimed to wrap themselves in the Constitution. They trampled it, instead. They claimed to be saving the Republic, but they fractured it, instead,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler argued.\n\nMembers of the Oath Keepers organized a \"quick reaction force\" at a hotel in Virginia, which a prosecution witness testified contained the most weapons he had seen in one place since his military days . Caldwell stayed at the \"QRF\" hotel and met with Oath Keepers near Trump's speech in Washington on Jan. 6 before he went with his wife to the Capitol, where they went to the top of the inauguration platform set up on the west side of the Capitol.\n\nAnother Oath Keeper who pleaded guilty to a nonseditious conspiracy charge gave prosecutors some of their strongest testimony, telling jurors that he was prepared to die to keep Trump in office. Jason Dolan testified that he was ready to \"conquer or die\" and potentially \"take up arms\" to fight on Trump's behalf.\n\nAnother Oath Keeper who cooperated with the government, Graydon Young, testified that he thought he was part of a \"Bastille-type moment,\" referring to the storming of the fortress and political prison in Paris during the French Revolution era in 1789.\n\n\"I guess I was acting like a traitor against my own government,\" Young testified.\n\nThree other Oath Keepers pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy ; none of them testified during the trial .\n\nThe trial featured extensive Signal messages exchanged by members of the alleged conspiracy, along with substantial audio of Rhodes both before and after the Jan. 6 attack. In a conference call in November 2020, which was recorded by at least one member, Rhodes said those who opposed Biden were on the same path as the Founding Fathers were before the American Revolution.\n\n\"You've got to make sure [Trump] knows that you are willing to die to fight for this country,\" Rhodes told the Oath Keepers on the call. \"We're very much in exactly the same spot that the Founding Fathers were in like March 1775. ... Nothing left but to fight. ... We're not getting out of this without a fight. There's going to be a fight. But let's just do it smart, and let's do it while President Trump is still commander in chief, and let's try to get him to do his duty and step up and do it.\"\n\nProsecutors also played audio of Rhodes continuing to plot to oppose the government after the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"We should have brought rifles. We could have fixed it right then and there,\" Rhodes said in a Jan. 10, 2021, meeting with a man who he believed would be able to pass along a message to Trump . \"I'd hang f---in' Pelosi from the lamppost.\"\n\nThe trial also featured testimony from Michael Greene, aka \"Whip,\" who waived his Fifth Amendment right to testify on Rhodes' behalf. Greene, a military veteran who worked for the company formerly known as Blackwater, testified that the Oath Keepers were on a security mission and that he didn't take Rhodes' talk about civil war seriously.\n\n\"It's nothing different from an old guy at the barbershop talking about there's a fight coming,\" Greene said.\n\nPressed by a federal prosecutor about whether old guys at the barbershop stormed the Capitol, Greene noted there were a lot of old people at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and that he has been indicted alongside two other older men. \"They're old as s---,\" Greene said of his alleged co-conspirators.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged about 900 people in connection with the Capitol attack and is asking Congress for more resources for the investigation. Hundreds of additional cases are in the works.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday highlighted the bureau's role in the Oath Keepers case.\n\n\"As this case shows, breaking the law in an attempt to undermine the functioning of American democracy will not be tolerated,\" Wray said in a statement. \"The FBI will always uphold the rights of all citizens who peacefully engage in First Amendment protected activities, but we and our partners will continue to hold accountable those who engaged in illegal acts regarding the January 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol.\"\n\nFour other Oath Keepers charged in conjunction with Rhodes - Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel and Ed Vallejo - are set to go to trial in early December.\n\nRyan J.

Prosecutors had sought 27 years in prison for Nordean, who was convicted in May of seditious conspiracy and five other felony charges.\n\nProsecutors said the Proud Boy \"led a force to the Capitol for the purpose of taking the fight to the people that he viewed as the 'traitors' who were stealing the election - the lawfully elected representatives of the people of the United States.\" Nordean, prosecutors said, \"held himself out as a man ready to dole out violence to anyone who opposes him\" and \"because known above all else\" for violence.\n\n\"As a leader on January 6, Nordean played a central role in unleashing the violence and destruction at the U.S. Capitol,\" prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. \"Nordean's ability and willingness to lead others to engage in political violence, and his continued commitment to the same beliefs that animated that leadership and led to that violence on January 6, pose a continuing threat to our nation.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, Kelly sentenced one of Nordean's co-defendants, Dominic Pezzola , who was acquitted of seditious conspiracy, to 10 years in federal prison. Joe Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in federal prison on Thursday, while Zach Rehl received 15 years in federal prison. Both were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other charges. On Tuesday, Kelly will sentence the final co-defendant, former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy. Prosecutors are seeking 33 years in federal prison for Tarrio, the same sentence they sought for Biggs.\n\nSpeaking to the court before being sentenced on Friday afternoon, Nordean apologized for not being a more responsible leader of the men he commanded on Jan. 6 and said \"there is no excuse\" for what he did.\n\n\"No matter how we all try to individually slice January 6 we must conclude it was a complete and utter tragedy,\" Nordean said. \"It is my humble opinion that there is no rally or political protest that should ever hold value over human life.\"\n\nNordean's sister and wife also addressed the court, painting a picture of him as a loving family man. Nordean remained composed throughout but could be seen wiping away a tear after his wife finished speaking.\n\nPezzola, after receiving his 10-year sentence earlier on Friday, yelled out \"Trump won!\" as he was led out of court.\n\nAbout 1,100 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and more than 300 have received periods of incarceration.\n\nNordean and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes now jointly hold the record for the longest Jan. 6 sentence. As of Friday, federal Bureau of Prisons records indicate that Rhodes is set for release on June 12, 2037, factoring in the time he already served and credit for good time.\n\nDaniel Barnes reports for NBC News, based in Washington.\n\nRyan J.

Dominic Pezzola , another member of the group, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy. Tarrio, Biggs, Nordean and Rehl were also found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, while U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly declared a mistrial on that count for Pezzola after the jury said it could not come to an agreement.\n\nAll five Proud Boys members were charged with nine counts in connection with the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, while Pezzola - who was caught on video smashing in a window with a Capitol Police shield during the breach and who admitted to his behavior on the stand - was separately charged with a 10th count of stealing the police shield and found guilty Thursday.\n\nPezzola was also found guilty of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, while the four other defendants were acquitted on that charge.\n\nThe jury reached only a partial verdict, and Kelly declared a mistrial on several other counts on which it did not come to a conclusion.\n\nThe trial unfolded over four months, with jury selection beginning in December and opening arguments starting in early January. It was the third seditious conspiracy case to go before jurors since the Capitol attack: Six members of the far-right Oath Keepers group, including founder Stewart Rhodes, were convicted on that charge across two trials in November and January .\n\nJeremy Bertino, a high-level member of the Proud Boys who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in October, testified for the prosecution in this latest trial as part of a plea deal, telling jurors that Proud Boys believed they \"had to do anything that was necessary to save the country.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that the Proud Boys were \" thirsting for violence \" on Jan. 6 and had organized in advance to stop certification of President Joe Biden's win by \"any means necessary, including by force.\"\n\nDefense attorneys countered that the Justice Department was using the group as a scapegoat for the real person to blame for Jan. 6: Donald Trump.\n\nTwo defendants testified at the trial: Rehl, the head of the organization's Philadelphia chapter, and Pezzola, a floor installer from New York whom members of the organization called \"Spaz.\" Just before Rehl was set to be cross-examined, online sleuths surfaced videos that appeared to show him deploying a can of pepper spray toward officers; Rehl, who was not charged with assaulting police, denied it at trial. Pezzola got heated on the stand, bringing up conspiracy theories about another Jan. 6 participant, Ray Epps, and ranting about the \"fake\" charges and the \"phony\" trial .\n\nThe biggest challenge prosecutors faced was convincing a jury that Tarrio, the former Proud Boys chairman, was a part of the conspiracy, given that he spent Jan. 6 at a hotel in Baltimore after he was banned from Washington the day before . Tarrio, in encrypted messages revealed during the trial, acknowledged receiving a message from someone who wanted to \"storm the Capitol\" but did not directly endorse that plan, and prosecutors seemed to concede that much of what happened on Jan. 6 happened spontaneously. What they were able to show was that Tarrio said he wanted a \"spectacle\" on Jan. 6 and that he celebrated the attack on the Capitol after it happened, giving the Proud Boys credit for the breach.\n\nSeveral other Proud Boys have pleaded guilty for their actions on Jan. 6, and another went to trial while the larger seditious conspiracy trial was underway. Joshua Pruitt, a Washington, D.C., bartender who joined the Proud Boys and stormed the Capitol, was sentenced to 4 .5 years in prison in August. Nicholas Ochs, the founder of the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, was sentenced to four years in prison in December .\n\nJudge Kelly will ultimately sentence the defendants.\n\nRyan J.

Federal prosecutors sought a sentence of 33 years in federal prison; U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced Tarrio's co-defendants to much lower terms than those sought by prosecutors.\n\nLast week, Joe Biggs was sentenced to 17 years, Zachary Rehl to 15 years and Ethan Nordean to 18 years. Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola , the fifth defendant, was found not guilty of the top charge of seditious conspiracy but guilty of other charges; he was sentenced to 10 years .\n\nAttorney General Merrick B. Garland said after Tarrio's sentencing that the Proud Boys had played a \"central role\" in leading efforts to breach the Capitol.\n\n\"Over the past week, four members of the Proud Boys received sentences that reflect the danger their crimes pose to our democracy,\" Garland said in a statement. \"Today, the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, learned that the consequence of conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power is 22 years in federal prison.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors called Tarrio a \"naturally charismatic leader, a savvy propagandist, and the celebrity Chairman of the national Proud Boys organization.\" Tarrio, they said, had \"influence over countless subordinate members,\" which he used \"to organize and execute the conspiracy to forcibly stop the peaceful democratic transfer of power.\"\n\nTarrio was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; he was arrested about 48 hours before the attack because of his actions at a previous pro-Trump event in Washington. Tarrio knew a warrant was out for his arrest thanks to a Washington police lieutenant who has since been charged and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said the evidence suggests Tarrio \"strategically calculated his arrest as a means to inspire a reaction by his followers.\"\n\nThat Tarrio spent most of Jan. 6 at a hotel in Baltimore, prosecutors said, \"does nothing to detract from the severity of his conduct,\" because he \"was a general rather than a soldier.\"\n\nTarrio, prosecutors said, is \"intelligent, charming, creative, and articulate - a gifted communicator who excels at attracting followers\" who \"used those talents to inflame and radicalize untold numbers of followers, promoting political violence in general and orchestrating the charged conspiracies in particular.\"\n\n\"To Tarrio, January 6 was an act of revolution,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nThey argued for a terrorism sentencing enhancement, saying his actions were clearly intended to influence the government. The judge agreed, applying the terrorism enhancement in Tarrio's case, as he did for Tarrio's four co-defendants.\n\n\"My client is no terrorist. My client is a misguided patriot,\" Tarrio's lawyer Sabino Jauregui said, arguing that his client went to Washington to \"protest.\"\n\n\"My client comes from a country where there are no rights, there's nothing,\" he said, referring to Tarrio's Cuban heritage. \"He was trying to protect this country, as misguided as he was.\"\n\nTarrio's defense team argued for a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines, seeking an unspecified lower sentence, and they submitted letters of support to the court, including one from a cousin of Tarrio's who has worked for Miami police for 16 years.\n\nThe defense had asked Kelly to see \"another side\" of Tarrio that is \"benevolent, cooperative with law enforcement, useful in the community, hardworking and with a tight-knight family unit and community support.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Conor Mulroe, arguing for the prosecution, called Tarrio's behavior a \"calculated act of terrorism,\" saying the consequences need to be abundantly clear to anyone who might be unhappy with the results of the 2024 election and any elections in the future.\n\n\"There was a very real possibility that we were going to wake up on January 7 in a full-blown constitutional crisis with the federal government in complete chaos,\" Mulroe said. \"That is what revolution means and that is what he openly perused and that is what he very nearly achieved. And it didn't take rifles and explosives.\"\n\nMulroe also pushed back against Tarrio's lawyers' attributing his actions to \"misguided patriotism,\" saying Tarrio's plan was for street violence on a national scale to be brought to bear against the seat of government.\n\nThe Proud Boys' actions \"were absolutely pivotal to what happened on January 6,\" he said. \"They were a tidal wave of force that had such a dramatic effect on the day's events.\"\n\nBefore his sentencing, Tarrio delivered a contrite statement, apologizing to members of law enforcement, the citizens of Washington, lawmakers and his family. \"To the men and women of law enforcement who answered the call that day, I'm sorry,\" Tarrio said.\n\n\"I have always tried to hold myself to a higher standard, and I failed,\" he said. \"I failed miserably. I thought of myself morally above others, and this trial has humbled me.\"\n\nTarrio also walked back statements he had made comparing Pezzola to George Washington, a statement that appeared to irk Kelly when it came up earlier in the proceeding.\n\nTarrio also sought to downplay his political involvement, saying he did not intend to change the results of the election on Jan. 6 but only planned to go to speak at an event to support Donald Trump and to support his friends.\n\n\"I am not a political zealot,\" he said. \"When I get back home, I want nothing to do with politics, groups, activism or rallies.\"\n\nTarrio added that he would not say anything different after Kelly left the room, an apparent reference to his co-defendant Pezzola, who shouted \"Trump won\" after he was sentenced to 10 years last week.\n\nAbout 1,100 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, and more than 300 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration. There are new arrests every week, including the recent arrest s of the first person who is seen on video breaching the lower west tunnel at the Capitol and of another defendant who the FBI said stormed the Capitol and recorded a TikTok video in which he bragged that rioters \"took the White House.\"\n\n\"The FBI will always protect those who peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement after Tarrio's sentencing. \"But we will never condone the actions of those who break our laws, and we will continue to work with federal prosecutors to ensure those perpetrators are held responsible.\"\n\nDaniel Barnes reports for NBC News, based in Washington.\n\nRyan J.

In a politically-charged speech in the courtroom just before his sentencing, he called himself a \"political prisoner\" and said that when he talked about \"regime change\" in a phone call with supporters earlier this week, he meant he hopes that former President Donald Trump will win in 2024.\n\nThe judge disagreed that Rhodes had been locked up for politics, saying it was his actions that led to his criminal convictions.\n\n\"You, sir, present an ongoing threat and a peril to this country and to the republic and to the very fabric of this democracy,\" Judge Amit Mehta said before handing down the sentence.\n\nRhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy in November along with Kelly Meggs, a fellow Oath Keepers member.\n\n\"They won't fear us until we come with rifles in hand,\" Rhodes wrote in a message ahead of the Jan. 6 attack. After the attack, in a recording that was played in court during his trial, he said his only regret was that they \" should have brought rifles .\"\n\nWearing an orange prison jumpsuit Thursday, Rhodes said he believes the only crime he committed was opposing those who are \"destroying our country.\"\n\nMehta told Rhodes that he was found guilty of seditious conspiracy \"not because of your beliefs, not because you supported the other guy, not because Joe Biden is president right now,\" but because of the facts of the case, and his actions before, during and after Jan. 6.\n\n\"You are not a political prisoner, Mr. Rhodes,\" he said.\n\nMeggs was also sentenced by Judge Mehta Thursday, to 12 years in federal prison. Mehta said Meggs did not pose the same continuing threat as Rhodes and a shorter sentence was more appropriate. The 12-year sentence for Meggs is the third longest handed down for a Jan. 6 defendant.\n\nAn emotional Meggs delivered a statement and apologized to his family for the pain and suffering he'd caused them. Meggs' sister, brother and son were in the courtroom - his wife Connie, who also participated in the Jan. 6 riot and has been separately convicted on multiple counts, was not present.\n\n\"I want to apologize to those that I've disappointed and let down,\" Meggs said. \"My deepest regret is the pain and suffering I've caused my family.\"\n\nRhodes and Meggs were put on trial alongside Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell, fellow Oath Keepers who were convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting, but not seditious conspiracy. Watkins and Harrelson will be sentenced Friday.\n\nRhodes took the stand in his case, saying at the trial that the other members of the Oath Keepers were \"stupid\" to storm the Capitol and that he disagreed with those who went inside; Rhodes did not enter the building. \"I had no idea that any Oath Keeper was even thinking about going inside or would go inside,\" he said.\n\nBut the government also produced messages in which Rhodes said he thought that Jan. 6 was the last opportunity to stop what he saw as a takeover of the government.\n\n\"On the 6th, they are going to put the final nail in the coffin of this Republic, unless we fight our way out. With Trump (preferably) or without him, we have no choice,\" Rhodes wrote in a message ahead of Jan. 6.\n\nHe also celebrated Oath Keepers' actions in the immediate aftermath of the attack, after meeting with other members of the group at an Olive Garden restaurant in Virginia that night.\n\n\"Patriots, it was a long day but a day when patriots began to stand,\" he wrote the night of Jan. 6. \"Stand now or kneel forever. Honor your oaths. Remember your legacy.\"\n\nPrior to Thursday's sentence, Peter Schwartz, who was armed with a wooden tire knocker and engaged in a series of assaults on officers during the Capitol attack, had received the longest time behind bars for a Jan. 6 defendant: just more than 14 years. Schwartz had 38 prior convictions.\n\nRyan J.

      "text": "Proud Boys blame Trump as defendants prepare to find out fate in sedition trial\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Attorneys for the Proud Boys placed blame for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol on Donald Trump in closing arguments in their seditious conspiracy trial Tuesday.\n\nAn attorney for Enrique Tarrio, the head of the Proud Boys, said federal prosecutors were trying to make him a \"scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and for those in power.\" A lawyer for Joe Biggs said the defendants came to Washington because their \"commander-in-chief\" told them it would \"be wild,\" referring to Trump's infamous tweet on Dec. 19, 2020, that called on supporters to come to Washington on Jan. 6.\n\n\"'Be there, it's going to be wild,' the commander-in-chief said. And so they did,\" Norm Pattis, an attorney for Biggs, told jurors, adding that \"their commander-in-chief sold them a lie.\"\n\nTarrio, Biggs and fellow Proud Boys Ethan Nordean, Dominic Pezzola and Zach Rehl each face at least nine counts, including seditious conspiracy, a rarely used Civil War era law. The trial has been underway for more than three months, and jury selection began in December 2022. The government said in closing arguments Monday that the Proud Boys wanted to be \"Donald Trump's army\" and were \" thirsting for violence and organizing for action\" ahead of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nThe defense lawyers wrapped their closing arguments early Tuesday afternoon, and the Justice Department presented its rebuttal argument as the day came to a close. Jurors will begin deliberating Wednesday.\n\nTwo defendants testified during the trial: Rehl and Pezzola. Just before Rehl was set to be cross-examined, online sleuths surfaced videos that appeared to show him deploying a can of pepper spray on officers. Pezzola got heated on the stand, bringing up conspiracy theories about another Jan. 6 participant, Ray Epps, and ranting about the \"fake\" charges and the \"phony\" trial .\n\nBiggs' lawyer, Pattis, told jurors that \"Jan. 6 was a perfect storm\" and that Trump played a large role. If \"the case of United States v. Donald J. Trump\" is ever brought, Pattis said, the \"fight like hell\" quote would be \"exhibit one.\" But Trump wasn't on trial, he said.\n\nDefense attorney Nayib Hassan, representing Tarrio, also pointed the finger at Trump, saying his anger caused what happened on Jan. 6 and reminding jurors that Trump said \"fight like hell\" or his supporters weren't \"going to have a country anymore.\"\n\nHassan even partly blamed the membership of the Proud Boys on Trump, saying Trump's \"stand back and stand by\" callout to the group brought new attention to the Proud Boys and they grew so quickly that \"vetting became difficult.\"\n\nHassan said Tarrio couldn't have known what was going to happen at the Capitol from a \"hotel in Baltimore,\" where he was holed up on Jan. 6. (Unlike his co-defendants, Tarrio didn't go to the Capitol on Jan. 6 after he was banned from Washington the day before .) Tarrio couldn't have predicted the future, Hassan said, showing a photo of Nostradamus.\n\nHe reminded jurors that Tarrio was in communication with a Washington Metropolitan Police officer in the months leading up to Jan. 6 and even told the police official where he would be staying in Washington. Why, Hassan asked, would Tarrio give an officer that information if he was going to commit sedition, one of the most serious crimes against the U.S.?\n\n\"Enrique was an entertainer, a lover and a razzle-dazzler,\" Hassan argued.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Moore said in the government's rebuttal that it was more than just talk.\n\n\"Enrique Tarrio isn't being 'scapegoated' for Jan. 6. He's being held accountable for the crimes he committed,\" Moore said after having shown a video posted on Parler in which Tarrio stood in front of the Capitol wearing a mask. \"Premonition,\" he titled the video.\n\nRyan J.

Superior Court, multiple sources said. So was the chief of the Capitol Siege Section, which was disbanded when Trump took office and pardoned more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n\"They really rubber roomed a lot of people,\" one federal law enforcement official said.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington is unique in that it handles both federal crimes in U.S. District Court as well local crimes in Superior Court. Demoting leaders on the federal side of the office to the lowest level of the Superior Court team, one law enforcement source said, \"is the biggest f--- you that you can receive,\" noting that many of these supervisors worked misdemeanors when they first started out as \"baby prosecutors.\"\n\nAmongst the prosecutors demoted, multiple current and former law enforcement officials said, were Greg Rosen, who was in charge of the Capitol Siege Section.\n\n\"Greg Rosen, who ran the Capitol Siege Section, was, quite literally, the best boss and team leader I've ever seen,\" former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan Ballou said in a statement to NBC News. \"Like a great football coach, he brought the best out of every player.

      "text": "âWelcome to the familyâ: How Donald Trump learned to love the January 6 prisoner movement\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn January 7, 2021, as shell-shocked staffers swept up the Capitol and National Guard troops patrolled the Mall, President Donald Trump released a video denouncing the âheinous attack on the United States Capitol.â He declared himself âoutraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhemâ and promised âto those who broke the law, you will pay.â\n\nThree years later, more than 1,300 people have been charged on counts ranging from felonies like seditious conspiracy and assaulting a police officer , to misdemeanor offences like illegally demonstrating in the Capitol. About 500 people have been sentenced to prison.\n\nAnd today, Trump has a different word for those people: âhostages.â\n\nThe former president and presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee has put the devoted supporters charged with January 6 crimes at the heart of his campaign. He began his first major campaign rally last March firing up the Waco, Texas crowd by playing âJustice for All,â a song he helped produce with the âJ6 Prison Choir.â It has since become a staple of his events. On Truth Social last week , Trump wrote that one of his âfirst acts as your next Presidentâ would be to âFree the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned.â\n\nThe story of Trumpâs shift âÂ from reluctant denunciations to direct support for those charged in connection with the dayâs events âÂ offers a glimpse into the workings of his mind, and of his political operation. The change began gradually, soon after he left office and weathered impeachment proceedings. Two months after he resumed civilian life at Mar-a-Lago, the president described the crowd to two visiting Washington Post reporters as âloving,â and offered a defense of their behavior: Capitol Police had âusheredâ them into the building, he said, and were âhugging and kissingâ them â a view belied by video footage and widely rejected by the courts. Aides to Trump point to remarks from this period as evidence he always cared about the cause of January 6th defendants.\n\nA detailed examination of his public statements and ten interviews with people now involved in the movement to support January 6 defendants show a gradual path from Trumpâs instinctive support for some of the most hardcore members of his own MAGA movement to a semi-formal alliance with an organization founded by the family member of a January 6 convict.\n\nThat path was smoothed in part by a handful of women â from the high-profile Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to lesser-known figures like Trump campaign staffer Joanna Miller Wischer and Cynthia Hughes, who founded the Patriot Freedom Project. They made the case to him that at least some of his devoted followers charged in the riot were jailed unjustly, and were being treated poorly.\n\nAnother crucial factor in Trumpâs growing support for the cause may have been his own confrontation with American law enforcement, including over charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which has become a centerpiece of his campaign for president.\n\nâThe biggest thing that helped us was him getting arrested, so that the rest of the world can see what is happening to J-6âers,â Tamara Perryman, whose husband Brian Jackson was charged in connection with the riot, told Semafor during the nightly vigil outside of the D.C. lockup beside the Anacostia River. âNow heâs welcome to the family.â\n\nA movement begins\n\nThe early icon for sympathizers of the January 6 detainees was Ashli Babbitt, a 36-year-old woman who was shot dead during the riot by Capitol Police Lieutenant Michael Byrd as she moved to enter into an area of the Capitol where lawmakers were evacuating. Within six months of her death, Babbitt became a âmartyrâ of sorts, held up by Trump and many within his movement: Trump called Babbittâs mother in early July that same year to express his condolences, and soon began mentioning her during public appearances.\n\nâI want to know why is the person who shot Ashli Babbitt getting away with murder?â Trump told the Washington Post in a statement at the time.\n\nTrumpâs early mentions of Babbitt include remarks to reporters on July 7, 2021 at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He said âthere was no reasonâ for the officer to shoot Babbitt and criticized the DOJ for clearing the officer involved of any wrongdoing. He told the assembled reporters then that detainees âare being treated unbelievably unfairly.â\n\nFive days later, Trump mentioned Babbitt again during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Newsâs âSunday Morning Features,â and said it was ânot rightâ that so many had been jailed.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies were beginning to offer support to the January 6 prisoners. Greene, the confrontational second-term Georgia congresswoman who is one of Trumpâs closest allies in the House of Representatives, visited accused rioters in the Washington, D.C. jail in November of 2021. She described detainees weeping while singing the National Anthem amid âinhumaneâ conditions. (A U.S. Marshals Service report at the time âdid not identify conditions that would necessitate the transfer of inmates,â though a federal judge did hold jail officials in contempt for delaying surgery on a detaineeâs wrist.)\n\nGreene, one Trump aide said, is a central figure in Trumpâs connection to the January 6 detainees and their families. The Congresswoman could not be reached for an interview before publication.\n\nBut as Greene sought to help ignite a movement, it wasnât yet clear whether Trumpâs comments represented a 180-degree shift from his early condemnation, or just loose talk from a former president who isnât always taken literally. January 6 families, defendants, and their lawyers were uncertain what to make of his sporadic early remarks, they said. Many were disappointed by what they viewed as a lack of support from the former president, starting with his failure to grant them pardons before leaving office.\n\nIn early 2022, Joseph McBride, a lawyer for multiple January 6 defendants, went to Mar-a-Lago to speak with members of Trumpâs team. Since that first meeting, McBride says heâs spoken with people across Trumpâs orbit â even meeting with Trumpâs legal team on occasion â and that January 6 events have grown organically over time.\n\nâI said, âHey, listen. I need to come speak to you,â McBride told Semafor about that 2022 meet-up. âNot just about my clients, but about whatâs going on with these guys in jail, how theyâre being treated unfairly in court. And I want to know from you guys: Will you consider pardoning these guys if you get re-elected?â And thatâs where the conversation started.â (McBride said he couldnât recall the exact date of this visit, and declined to say specifically who heâd met.)\n\nOn January 29, 2022, Trump said during a rally in Conroe, Texas that heâd consider pardoning some people charged in the attack should he take office again.\n\nâAnother thing weâll do â and so many people have been asking me about it â if I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly,â the former president said. âWe will treat them fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.â\n\nOver the next few months, Trump began to be more forceful on the topic: He told Newsmax in February that heâd âabsolutely be preparedâ to issue pardons, and called for âjustice for the January 6 prisonersâ during a North Carolina rally in April.\n\nGetting Trumpâs attention\n\nIn June of 2022, Hughesâ Patriot Freedom Project held a press conference outside the Capitol with Greene. The gathering caught Trumpâs attention, and he had an associate contact her, Hughes said in a later interview.\n\nAnd so in August of 2022, Trump welcomed Hughes and Julie Kelly, a conservative political commentator who writes often about January 6 developments, to Bedminster.\n\nâUp until that point, he really wasnât aware of what was happening with these individuals,â Kelly told Semafor. âHis team wasnât really aware, so that was the purpose of the briefing in August of 2022. I had been contacted by one of his associates a few months before that wanting to know what they could do to help.â\n\nKelly said she sensed âa heightened interestâ around this time from Trump and his orbit â and she gave Trump a blunt assessment of the situation: His judicial picks trying the January 6 cases, she told him, âwere among the worst on the bench,â and family members and defendants remained disappointed âthat he had been really silent up until that point.â\n\nThe appeal from Kelly and Hughes had an immediate impact on the former president. After the meeting, Trump shifted to more organized action, a second Trump aide said, with the help of Joanna Miller Wischer, a senior advisor at his Save America PAC, who had already been unofficially working with January 6 advocates. She had worked as a Trump White House policy aide, and was cited by one January 6 family member as a key liaison to Trumpworld.\n\nIn September of 2022 â one month after Trump met with Kelly and Hughes â Miller Wischer, who had briefly left the PAC, pitched Trump on empowering her to work full-time to help January 6 family members. He jumped at the proposal, the second aide said. Soon, she returned to the PAC and was spending most of her time connecting January 6 family members with members of Congress and helping them make their case to the public.\n\nâThat was a directive directly from him,â the Trump aide, who wasnât authorized to speak on the record, told Semafor of the decision to appoint someone to specifically work with the January 6 orbit. âWhen he started to learn about what exactly was going on, he became so disgusted by what he was hearing he had to hire.â\n\nTrump would continue to build on his relationship with the Patriot Freedom Project: Hughes spoke at Trumpâs Pennsylvania rally in September of 2022. While his new embrace of the January 6 defendants sometimes slipped under the media radar, Hughesâ public defense of her nephew, an alleged Nazi sympathizer photographed with a Hitler mustache, drew the attention of California Democrat Zoe Lofgren .\n\nâBeing a supporter of Adolf Hitler does put you in the Fascist category,â Lofgren said. (Hughesâ nephew said his Nazi posturing was ironic. Hughes did not respond to interview requests.)\n\nTrump filmed a video for a fundraiser the Patriot Freedom Project hosted in December 2022, and Save America PAC donated $10,000 to the nonprofit. He hosted and spoke at another fundraiser for the group at Bedminster in June of 2023. The former president has since attended âsemi-regularâ January 6 events at both Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster, often popping in to chat with family members and reiterate his support for their cause, advocates said.\n\nMeanwhile, state and federal prosecutors circled the former president, which some aides and advocates believe deepened his identification with the January 6 descendants. One Trump aide rejected this characterization, noting that the situations are âso different.â Trump, the aide said, âsees how unfairly theyâre being treatedâ and believes theyâve been denied âdue processâ â complaints that Trump has levied about his own cases.\n\nFederal judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents have presided over cases related to January 6 and stressed the importance of accountability for crimes committed that day. One of those judges, Tanya Chutkan, is now overseeing Trumpâs own federal election interference case.\n\nâHeâs [Trump] spoken directly to lots of January 6 families, and even talked to a lot of January 6 defendants,â said Kash Patel, a former White House national security aide and Trump loyalist whose Kash Foundation has helped some defendants. âIt doesnât differentiate from how he handles other matters that heâs involved with and wants to lend his support to.â\n\nA contentious movement\n\nBy the time Trump was running for president in 2023, the scattered voices of sympathy had officially coalesced into a movement â or to be precise, into a handful of groups with different identities and, at times, agendas. They sometimes butted heads, but generally worked alongside, though not necessarily with, each other.\n\nâLook, the January 6 world of people isnât perfect,â McBride said. âThereâs a lot of people who have inserted themselves sort of into the January 6 orbit who have caused division, who have caused strife, who have turned people against each other. And I think that some of that internal dissent based on the January 6 communityâ¦has potentially turned off people from working with them, and rightfully so.â\n\nOne key figure in this new movement is Patel, who worked with former Fox News host Ed Henry and Trump to record the prisonersâ âJustice for Allâ song in March 2023. Profits from the music were reportedly to be directed to January 6 families. (One of the choir members seen singing in a widely circulated video was sentenced to seven years in prison last year after a jury found he smashed a Capitol window with a tomahawk and threw a flagpole, a wooden desk drawer, and other objects at police. His attorney said he was not on the song recording.)\n\nPatel said he employs a ârigorous screening processâ to decide which January 6 defendants heâll support.\n\nâWe donât assist those who have committed acts of violence, especially against law enforcement,â Patel said. âThatâs not to say weâre judging whether or not they did â we have to right now rely on the charging documents from the DOJ and the FBI as they come in.â\n\nA Trump aide said itâs âtoo early to tellâ when asked about any plan to implement such a screening process as Trump continues to consider pardons, noting that thereâs typically an official pardon process through the White House.\n\nOthers are less focused on drawing distinctions among the defendants and convicts. Babbittâs mother Micki Witthoeft relocated to the Washington, D.C. area after her daughterâs death, and now leads a nightly candlelight vigil held outside of the jail, where supporters gather to sing the National Anthem with January 6th participants locked up inside.\n\nAt a recent gathering, a few of the dozen or so attendees were quick to note that they donât have close relationships with the Trump campaign, although Trump himself has called into the vigil on a few occasions.\n\nThe group says they only raise money, via nightly live streams, for prisonersâ commissary funds or other support, and that it all goes directly to people inside the jail.\n\nThey, in turn, also said they arenât connected to the Patriot Freedom Project, the organization headed up by Hughes, whose conversation with Trump helped spur his interest in the cause.\n\nToday, thereâs not a singular liaison between the various groups and Trump himself. Instead, the families rely on a network that includes members of Congress (Greene and Rep. Matt Gaetz are seen as particular allies by the January 6 defendantsâ families) as well as various advocacy groups and people close to Trump.\n\nBut questions â and disagreements â remain, particularly for those advocating on behalf of January 6âers: Some, like Kelly, want Trump to issue a blanket pardon or commutations should he take office again, while others believe it should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Most seem to also want a renewed push to investigate the goings-on of that day, a demand that has filtered through the current Republican Congress.Â In addition to a new House Republican probe of the last Congressâ Select Committee on January 6th, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy turned over Capitol security footage to Tucker Carlson and Speaker Mike Johnson released thousands of hours of footage earlier this month.\n\nâI think a case-by-case pardon is best, because a blanket pardon would avoid any investigation into that day,â Babbittâs mother told Semafor. âA blanket pardon will allow that to be swept under the rug.â\n\nAnd, as far as theyâre concerned, the work is just beginning: McBride told Semafor heâd like the January 6 movement to have a presence at the Republican National Convention this summer.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs evolution fits a familiar pattern that applies beyond the January 6th movement. Since leaving office, he appears more determined than ever to reward and empower loyalists, setting himself up for a second presidency fully on his own terms. The Capitol riot remains divisive within his party, though his view has begun to prevail, according to recent polls. But while the conventional political wisdom would suggest he court independent voters who remain appalled by the violence of January 6th, the former president has grown only more committed to the project.\n\nJudges in January 6-related cases have repeatedly rejected claims of unfair treatment, persecution, or government conspiracies, both inside and outside the courtroom.\n\nâI have been dismayed to see outright distortions and outright falsehoods creep into the public consciousness,â Judge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan appointee on the D.C. District Court, said at a sentencing hearing for a related misdemeanor case. âI have been shocked to watch some public figures try to rewrite history, claiming rioters behaved in an orderly fashion like ordinary tourists, or martyrizing convicted January 6 defendants as political prisoners or even, incredibly, hostages. That is all preposterous. But the court fears that such destructive, misguided rhetoric could presage further danger to our country.â\n\nPresident Biden has frequently denounced Trumpâs role in January 6th and top campaign officials recently told CNN they intend to make it a key plank of their message âÂ in part because Trump continues to be so vocal on the topic.\n\nâPeople know what happened on January 6,â Mike Donilon, a top Biden advisor, said. âI think most of the country is going to say, âWe donât embrace political violence. We do embrace democracy. We do embrace the rule of law. Weâre not interested in pardoning people who ransacked the Capitol, and weâre going to have a real problem supporting someone who embraces all that.ââ\n\nâI call him Â Â Jan. Sixth-er Number One,â McBride, the lawyer, told Robert Draper of the New York Times last summer.\n\nThe Washington Post Â Â analyzed Â Â how the January 6-related cases had progressed through the courts. Their conclusion, as of January 2024: âJudges have ordered prison time for nearly every defendant convicted of a felony and some jail time to about half of those convicted of misdemeanors. But in the vast majority of the more than 700 sentencings to date, judges have issued punishments below government guidelines and prosecutorsâ requests.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Donald Trump meets the mainstream media again\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump returned to non-conservative primetime television on Wednesday evening thanks to a CNN town hall â and the contentious, roughly hour-long event looked like 2016 again, amped up to 11.\n\nIn this article:\n\nIf youâre a reporter like me who follows Trump on Truth Social, attends his rallies, and watches his right-wing media interviews, much of what he said wasnât new or surprising.\n\nBut thatâs exactly why the town hall felt like such a major event: Outside of his MAGA base, Trumpâs daily pronouncements have been effectively invisible to large swaths of the country, even to many Republicans who are less engaged in day-to-day politics. This night was a post-January 6th Trump being reintroduced to mainstream media âÂ and their audience â in an unfiltered way for the first time since he left office, with unpredictable consequences.\n\nThe timing of the event also meant there was a large list of pent-up topics that moderator Kaitlan Collins had to clear, all while interrupting to add fact checks in front of a cheering crowd that was on Trumpâs side by design âÂ they applauded when he called her a ânasty personâ at one point. Here were some of the highlights.\n\nJANUARY 6\n\nTrump remained defiant more than two years after a group of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6 in an attempt to stop the certification of Joe Bidenâs victory. He said he did not feel that former Vice President Mike Pence was owed an apology over the day, maintaining that âhe did something wrongâ and âshouldâve put the votes back to the state legislatures.â\n\nCollins and Trump sparred over the topic for a time, particularly over the timeline of Trumpâs response to the riot, and at one point the former president called it âa beautiful dayâ while in the same breath maintaining that he âwasnât involved in it very much.â Trump also addressed the swath of January 6 rioters currently in jail, telling voters that heâs âinclined to pardon many of themâ âÂ and âvery early on,â for that matter â should he take office again.\n\nAs for the group of Proud Boys recently charged and convicted of seditious conspiracy? The former president didnât rule out pardoning them either. âIâll have to look at their case, but I will say in Washington, D.C., you cannot get a fair trial, you cannot. Just like in New York City, you canât get a fair trial either,â Trump lamented.\n\nE. JEAN CARROLL\n\nA day after being found liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll, Trump reiterated many of his prior remarks on the trial, called Carroll âa whack job,â and swore on his children that he never assaulted her.\n\nOne moment that could stick around: His latest defense, in detail, of the infamous âAccess Hollywoodâ tape in which he said women âlet youâ grab them by the genitals âwhen youâre a star.â\n\nâYou would like me to take that back. I canât take it back because it happens to be true. Iâve said itâs been true for one million years, approximately a million years, perhaps a little bit longer than that,â Trump said.\n\nABORTION\n\nTrump was pressed repeatedly on abortion, where he said he was âhonoredâ to have appointed the judges who overturned Roe v. Wade, but did not directly answer whether heâd sign federal legislation banning abortion should he become president, or say the number of weeks abortion should be banned. Instead, he vaguely said that he was âlooking at a solution thatâs going to work.â\n\nâVery complex issue for the country,â Trump said. âYou wouldnât be having a discussion if you werenât able to get rid of Roe v. Wade.â\n\nUKRAINE\n\nTrump argued that Europe should be giving more money amid the Ukraine-Russia war, but wouldnât say whether he preferred one side to win over the other. The former president said he doesnât view the situation âin terms of winning and losingâ â rather, he âthink[s] in terms of getting settled so we stop killing all these people.â\n\nAs for whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal? Trump said that discussing the topic now would make it harder âto make a deal.â\n\nâHome run,â a Trump advisor texted me shortly after the town hall wrapped up. Jason Miller, another senior advisor on Trumpâs team, noted that âmany CNN viewers havenât seen him talk about his policy view on saving America in quite a whileâ and the event gave him a chance to win over independents by reflecting their criticism of President Biden. The Trump campaign has suggested it will put pressure on Ron DeSantis to prove he can handle similar live interviews with a media network often labeled as unfriendly towards Republicans.\n\nâHome run for us too â voters just were reintroduced to the same dangerous man Trump has always been,â one national Democratic operative said. They predicted Trump saying he was proud to overturn Roe v. Wade would come back to haunt him: âThat was the clip of the night for a general election.â\n\nThe pro-DeSantis group Never Back Down had an extremely notable kitchen-sink response on Twitter highlighting Trump discussing âWhat he did or didnât do on January 6, 2021,â âWhether he will pardon people who harmed police officers,â âHow the 2020 election was rigged,â âWhether he supports terminating parts of the U.S. Constitution,â âThe sex abuse case he was just found guilty in,â as well as the Access Hollywood tape, and investigations into his handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the election. âHow does this Make America Great Again?â they asked at the end.\n\nDeSantis â along with almost the entire Republican field â has barely mentioned any of these issues, amid speculation theyâre afraid of antagonizing his supporters. Could this be an indicator the gloves are coming off?\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Word is leaking that while science, health, transportation and other non-defense discretionary spending may be frozen, military and veterans spending will remain untethered. Joseph Zeballos-Roig and Jordan Weissmann have more on the emerging outline. Some members of the House Freedom Caucus are predictably upset, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is warning not to take Democratic votes for granted, but when I asked former Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer yesterday if he thought a deal would be achieved he said: âMy gut feeling is yes.â\n\nAn interesting way to start a presidential run is to frame it around COVID restrictions and mandates and a former director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases when most Americans have simply moved on and no longer simmer over past frustrations, but thatâs what Ron DeSantis did on the first day of his campaign. Shelby Talcott has more on how DeSantis seems to be running for president against Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nPlus, on the topic of Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes getting an 18 year sentence for seditious conspiracy around the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, Morgan Chalfant gets a sobering text from former assistant U.S. attorney Randall Eliason.\n\nHave a great Memorial Day Weekend from all of us at Semafor!\n\nWas this email forwarded to you? Sign up here!\n\nâ White House: President Biden vetoed a GOP-led bill that would have overturned police reforms in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the president is staying at Camp David this weekend, perhaps a sign of the need to keep him close amid ongoing talks on the debt ceiling.\n\nâ Senate: Majority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized a Supreme Court ruling that rolled back the power of the EPA to regulate U.S. wetlands, dismissing the body as the â MAGA Supreme Court .â Failed GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano said he would not be running for Senate in Pennsylvania, much to the relief of national Republicans. The federal investigation into Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. that Semafor first reported is looking at whether he or his wife received unreported gifts (like an apartment) from a halal meat company, according to the New York Times.\n\nâ House: House lawmakers left town but theyâve been told to keep relatively close so they can come back with 24 hours notice as debt ceiling negotiations grind on toward a resolution. China select committee Chair Mike Gallagher, R-Wis. was forced to postpone a bipartisan trip to Taiwan. Meanwhile, House Democrats have been grumbling about Biden needing to get more involved in the debt ceiling conversation; some urged him to give a national address or a âfireside chatâ about the stakes.\n\nâ Outside the Beltway: A unanimous Texas House committee voted to impeach the stateâs Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, after accusing him of committing multiple crimes and of abusing his power while in office. Paxton was previously indicted on state-level securities charges in 2015, which has remarkably not gone to trial, and is facing a corruption investigation by the FBI.\n\nThe leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, was sentenced to 18 years in prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy in connection with the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. âI dare say, Mr. Rhodes, and Iâve never said this about anyone who Iâve sentenced: You, sir, present an ongoing threat and peril to this country, to the republic and the very fabric of our democracy,â Judge Amit Mehta said while handing down the longest sentence so far of anyone ensnared in the post-Jan. 6 federal investigations.\n\nIn related news, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told a pair conservative radio hosts that his administration would âbe aggressive at issuing pardonsâ to victims of government âweaponization,â potentially including Jan. 6 rioters. Asked about pardoning Donald Trump should he be convicted of a federal crime, he said: âI would say any example of disfavored treatment based on politics or weaponization would be included in that review, no matter how small or how big.â\n\nDeSantisâ campaign said he raised $8.2 million in the 24 hours since he officially announced his presidential campaign in a botched Twitter conversation. Thatâs quite a bit more than the $6.3 million Biden raised in the first day of his 2020 campaign, and not too far off of the $9.5 million Trump raised in the first weeks of his third presidential campaign launch at the end of last year.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo met with her Chinese counterpart in D.C. yesterday and raised concerns about Beijingâs recent actions against U.S. companies operating in the Peopleâs Republic, according to the Biden administration. The two also talked about trade and areas of âpotential cooperation.â The View from Semaforâs Morgan Chalfant: Expect much more of this. The White Houseâs John Kirby told reporters earlier this week that the administration is trying to get back to the âspirit of Bali,â referring to the meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping last year when they agreed to improve communication channels. That may well mean trips to China by cabinet officials. That doesnât mean the conversations will be all friendly, but the White House wants to make sure the U.S. and China are talking more.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant, Shelby Talcott, and Jordan Weissmann\n\nPunchbowl News: House Democrats werenât happy with what they were hearing about an emerging deal between the White House and Speaker McCarthy as of yesterday afternoon. How unhappy? Punchbowl reports that Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other top Democrats called White House negotiators before yesterdayâs caucus meeting to warn that they canât count on getting 100 Democrats to vote in favor of any deal brokered with the speaker.\n\nPlaybook: The negotiators have âall but finalizedâ the spending caps portion of the debt ceiling deal in a sign of how close it is, but Politico warns that talks could still get blown up by unhappy progressives or conservatives.\n\nThe Early 202: The Washington Post assesses the emerging Republican presidential field , including three not-yet candidates who theyâre watching closely: Mike Pence, Chris Sununu, and Chris Christie.\n\nTHE NEWS\n\nThe details arenât final, and the parties are still clashing on a few major issues, but the contours of a potential debt ceiling deal are finally coming into view.\n\nSo far, it looks little like the bill House conservatives dreamed of passing earlier this month, which would have drastically cut back parts of the federal budget while forcing a repeal of President Bidenâs signature climate law.\n\nWhatâs on tap instead? The New York Times first reported on Thursday night that negotiators were close to an agreement on lifting the debt limit for two years â i.e. until after the election. In exchange, it would use some creative accounting to effectively freeze non-defense discretionary spending programs for that period, affecting a bucket that includes health, science, transportation, and more. However, the Pentagon and veteransâ budgets would be allowed to grow.\n\nThe deal may also cut as much as $10 billion of funding from the IRS funding, clawing back some of the $80 billion Democrats provided in the Inflation Reduction Act to improve the agencyâs service and raise revenue by chasing down tax cheats.\n\nA bargain on energy is also in the works, according to Bloomberg . It would trade reforms making it easier to build new transmission lines needed for renewable power in exchange for speeding up permitting for pipelines and other oil and gas projects.\n\nLawmakers emphasized that nothing is final yet. âWe do not have an agreement yet. We knew this would not be easy,â Speaker Kevin McCarthy said shortly before leaving the Capitol on Thursday evening. âItâs hard, but weâre working. And weâre gonna continue to work till we get this done.â\n\nRep. Garret Graves, his top lieutenant, said work requirements on safety net programs were still a sore point in the discussions. âThe White House continues to prioritize paying people to not work over paying Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits,â Graves told reporters. âI mean this is just a crazy calculation on their part. So thatâs the major hang up at this point.â\n\nJOSEPH AND JORDANâS VIEW\n\nA few days ago, Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, predicted to us that negotiators would âreach a narrower agreement with some face-saving measures and no triumphalism.â That feels more or less like whatâs shaping up.\n\nThe spending changes are reportedly designed so that Biden will be able to describe them as a freeze, while McCarthy will be able to claim they are a cut. Rolling back a portion of the IRS funding that Republicans have spent months attacking will give the party a partial policy win, while sparing Democrats the need to make major reductions to cherished programs.\n\nAnd fundamentally, the dealâs early outlines donât look all that different from something youâd see come out of a normal budget negotiation in Washington.\n\nThis could still all fall apart. But if it holds, the agreement seems guaranteed to lose a large number of conservative Republicans, whoâd set their hearts on using the debt ceiling as leverage to force massive cuts.\n\nâYou think that after what we passed, I should, in good faith, go back to the American people and say, yeah, letâs increase the debt ceiling another two and a half trillion dollars?â Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas told reporters.â Virginia Rep. Bob Good warned that McCarthyâs rumored concessions could âcollapseâ the GOP majority.\n\nDemocrats also spent much of Thursday raising concerns over a potential deal: Appearing on CNN, Sen. Bernie Sanders once again urged Biden to ignore the debt ceiling by invoking the 14th Amendment. If the final version includes significant new work requirements for federal aid recipients, it could drive away as many progressives as conservatives.\n\nCould McCarthy and Biden run into a math problem? Possibly. But so far, everything seems to be driving towards a moderatish compromise.\n\nâI think the coalition opposed to this will be like âthe squadâ and the Freedom Caucus, and itâll rocket through the Senate after it passes the House,â Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of McCarthyâs best known Republican antagonists, said during a Twitter Spaces event Thursday. âAnd I think thereâs no serious threat to McCarthyâs speakership.â\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nEven if a deal is on track, some Washington wonks are warning that timing could still be an issue. McCarthy has vowed to give members 72-hours to review legislative text before scheduling a floor vote. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is threatening to  slow down legislation that reaches the upper chamber if it doesnât meet his standards.\n\nâTiming is tight and getting tighter every minute,â Zach Moller, director of the economic program at the Third Way think tank, told Semafor. âTherefore the chance for an accidental default or some extra-extra-extraordinary measures is rapidly increasing.â\n\nMIAMI, FL â If day one of Ron DeSantisâ presidential campaign showed the country anything, itâs that COVID is here to stay.\n\nAt least in the Republican primaries.\n\nOn his first day in the ring, the Florida governor toured conservative media and threw some soft punches at Donald Trump, especially over the pandemic, where he gained a following among conservatives for pushing back on restrictions and mandates earlier than others.\n\nâ[Trump] did great for three years, but when he turned the country over to Fauci in March of 2020, that destroyed millions of peopleâs lives,â the Florida governor told Glenn Beck on Thursday. âI think when people look back, that 2020 year was not a good year for the country as a whole. It was a situation where Florida started to stand alone, so I think that thatâs [an] important contrast.â\n\nOn Twitter, the governorâs team and allies spent the day litigating the early days of the virus in a back-and-forth with Trumpworld. The âDeSantis War Roomâ Twitter account posted a throwback video in the afternoon of Trump defending shutting down the country in March 2020, while the âTrump War Roomâ engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with DeSantis aide Christina Pushaw over the governorâs own early restrictions and mortality rate in comparison to New York, with allied pundits popping in to throw chairs.\n\nâWhat specifically was the best aspect of Cuomo and New Yorkâs Covid response?â Pushaw tweeted at one point, complete with a meme drawing of a masked figure with needles in its body asking to âgovern me harder daddy.â Trumpâs team response began: âFirst of all, nobody wants to be your daddy.â\n\nDeSantis and his allies have been telegraphing COVID will be key to his campaign for months, so its appearance is not a surprise.\n\nThat he hit Trump with it so early is more notable: A number of other Republican presidential hopefuls have been more reluctant to offer up direct contrasts with the former president. DeSantisâ initial launch events on Wednesday largely ignored Trump. If today is any indication, things against the two front runners could heat up quickly, and certainly long before they meet on a debate stage (if Trump attends).\n\nAnd while the COVID battle took center stage, DeSantis made clear Thursday heâd try to get to Trumpâs right on other issues as well. In an interview with New Hampshire radio host Jack Heath, the Florida governor accused Trump of âmoving to the left,â pointing to Trumpâs attacks on him for not supporting a bill that would have traded legal status for DREAMers (an âimmigration amnestyâ as DeSantis put it) for a border wall. He also mentioned the âalmost $8 trillion in debt in just four yearsâ he racked up as president. In an interview with Dana Loesch, he criticized as âunconstitutionalâ Trumpâs 2018 call for red flag laws that âtake the guns first, go through due process second.â\n\nWhere was Trump during this campaignâs very online start? Touching grass, literally: He hit the greens at his golf club in Virginia.\n\nâHeâs very disloyal, but heâs got no personality,â Trump told reporters in between holes. âAnd if you donât have personality, politics is a very hard business.â\n\nâ Shelby Talcott\n\nRandall Eliason is a former assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Stewart Rhodes, Oath Keepers founder, found guilty of seditious conspiracy. What that means\n\nOath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and another member of the right-wing militia group were found guilty of seditious conspiracy Tuesday in connection to their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIt's rare for the government to charge someone with seditious conspiracy, let alone to win a conviction. The two-month trial raised the stakes for the Justice Department, which condemned the Capitol attack as an assault on democracy.\n\nThree other Oath Keepers associates on trial were acquitted of the charge.\n\nHere's what you need to know about seditious conspiracy.\n\nLegally, seditious conspiracy occurs when two or more people conspire to \"overthrow, put down or to destroy by force\" the U.S. government or bring war against it, or plot to use force to oppose the authority of the government or to block the execution of a law.\n\nProsecutors in the Oath Keepers trial charged that the militia members conspired to forcibly oppose the authority of the federal government and forcibly block the execution of laws governing the transfer of presidential power. Rhodes and one other Oath Keeper, Floridian Kelly Meggs, were found guilty of the former.\n\nSeditious conspiracy became a federal crime in 1861 , the year the Civil War began. The government sought to punish rebel Southerners who resisted the authority of the Constitution and existing Union. The charge is a less serious sister to treason.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is one of 57 federal crimes under the terrorism enhancement statute and can carry a 20-year prison sentence along with a maximum fine of $20,000.\n\nBut David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY that the maximum term could be increased by four to five years because the victims of the Oath Keepers' actions were federal government officials.\n\nA sentencing date has not been set.\n\nSeditious conspiracy was last charged in 2010, when members of the Hutaree militia, a right-wing Christian paramilitary group founded in Michigan, were accused of plotting to kill a police officer and then attack those in attendance at the funeral.\n\nIts members were acquitted in 2012 after a federal judge found the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendants had explicit plans for a rebellion, despite their hateful rhetoric.\n\n\"While this evidence could certainly lead a rational fact-finder to conclude that 'something fishy' was going on, it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants reached a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the United States government,\" Judge Victoria A. Roberts of Federal District Court wrote in her ruling, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe last time the government won a guilty verdict on the charge was during the 1995 prosecution of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb New York City landmarks, just four months after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.\n\nThen-FBI Director Louis Freeh called the verdicts \"an extraordinary victory in the fight against terrorism,\" while attorneys for the 10 defendants condemned the proceeding as a \"trial of nationalism\" decided on \"fear,\" the Washington Post reported at the time .\n\nFollowing the verdict, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the outcome evidenced the DOJ's commitment to \"holding accountable those criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy\" on Jan. 6.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said the case shows \"breaking the law in an attempt to undermine the functioning of American democracy will not be tolerated,\" and U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia said it \"reaffirms the strength of our democracy and the institutions that protect and preserve it.\"\n\nThe two Oath Keepers found guilty of seditious conspiracy bolster the government's narrative that the Capitol attack threatened American democracy, serving as a warning to government dissenters that violent acts against the U.S. will be punished.\n\nBut the acquittal handed down to the three other defendants could undermine that narrative and embolden the militia movement."

      "text": "4 Proud Boys, including leader Enrique Tarrio, guilty of seditious conspiracy for Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nProud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and three lieutenants were found guilty Thursday of entering a seditious conspiracy against the U.S. government that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. A fifth Proud Boy was acquitted of the charge.\n\nProsecutors painted Tarrio as the leader of the plot , despite not physically being in Washington that day. His arrest on Jan. 4, 2021, on unrelated charges and the stabbing of several Proud Boys at a protest in December 2020 turned members of the group against District of Columbia law enforcement and served as motivators to try to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election, the government claimed.\n\nBut Tarrio's attorneys argued that the Miami Proud Boy is the government's scapegoat for the Capitol attack. The true culprit of Jan. 6, they said, was former President Donald Trump , who inflamed a mob of supporters and directed them toward the Capitol.\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's words, it was his motivation, it was his anger that caused what occurred on Jan. 6,\" Tarrio attorney Nayib Hassan said in his closing remarks. \"They want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald Trump and those in power.\"\n\nDefendants Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl also were found guilty of seditious conspiracy. The jury decided later Thursday that defendant Dominic Pezzola, who is well known for using a police riot shield to break open a window of the Capitol, is not guilty of the charge.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who is overseeing the case, instructed the jury that they could return a partial verdict on any charges at any time. Kelly declared the jury hung on whether Pezzola conspired to obstruct the certification of the 2020 election and a second count of assaulting, resisting and impeding an officer. He also declared the jury hung on two charges for defendants Nordean, Biggs, Rehl and Tarrio.\n\nAll defendants were convicted of obstructing the certification of the 2020 presidential election, and all but Pezzola were convicted of conspiring to obstruct it. The defendants also were all convicted of conspiring to prevent an officer from discharging their duties, obstructing law enforcement and at least one count of destruction of government property. Pezzola was found guilty of a second count.\n\nEach dressed in a full suit, the Proud Boys stood shoulder-to-shoulder and were expressionless as the verdicts were read.\n\nThe Justice Department's conviction of Tarrio and three others on the rare, Civil War-era crime bolsters its account that the Capitol attack endangered American law and order. The Justice Department also earned several high-profile seditious conspiracy convictions of members of the right-wing militia group Oath Keepers, including leader Stewart Rhodes.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland Thursday lauded the work of federal prosecutors, FBI agents and analysts.\n\n\"Our work will continue,\" Garland said, adding that the verdicts were an example of the government's \"steadfast commitment to defend the American people and American democracy.\"\n\nGarland said the evidence presented at trial demonstrated the \"central role\" members of the extremist Proud Boys played in the effort to block the transfer of power.\n\nIn the jury trial's 15 weeks, heated legal disputes, regular bickering between attorneys and plain bad luck caused extensive delays to the proceeding that was once projected to last just six weeks. Kelly, the judge, thanked the jury for its diligence and patience before dismissing them.\n\n\"As you all know, this trial has gone on longer than me or you expected,\" he said.\n\nGavin McInnes, the right-wing provocateur who founded the Proud Boys, expressed disappointment to USA TODAY over the verdict.\n\n\"These guys have kids. This might as well be a death penalty,\" McInnes said over text. \"And for what? Wandering through a riot? The evidence showed there was no plan.\"\n\nJon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, told USA TODAY that the Proud Boys' convictions on several felony charges is a clear win for the Justice Department.\n\n\"This is a win for democracy,\" Lewis said. \"The leaders of the domestic violent extremist group that played the most prominent role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol have been judged to be guilty by a jury of their peers.\"\n\nBut the five Proud Boys' convictions on various felonies won't disappear their ideology, experts said. In the months since the defendants were indicted, other Proud Boys and right-wing extremists have continued to make shows of force on the new front lines of the culture wars, from school board meetings to drag shows .\n\n\"The culture war the Proud Boys were fighting on Jan. 6 has not disappeared; the movement has remained focused on radicalizing and mobilizing more and more Americans to violence,\" he said. \"Even as individual groups fade from prominence, it is the movement that will continue to attract followers.\"\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that the Proud Boys' continued activity poses a \"new challenge\" for safeguarding communities. But the convictions are an \"important step\" in the defense against extremism.\n\n\"These convictions highlight the Proud Boys' key role in the attack on the Capitol and send a clear message to members of the group who continue to threaten, disrupt and intimidate local communities that violent extremism will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement .\n\nThe five Proud Boys were found guilty of combined charges, including seditious conspiracy. Here are the charges on which a federal jury found the defendants guilty:\n\nThe jury found the Proud Boys not guilty of these charges:\n\nContributing: Will Carless"

A fifth person tied to the group, Ohioan Bennie Parker, was convicted of the charge on Tuesday.\n\nThe convictions are an important victory for the Justice Department, which has steadily worked towards imposing consequences on people who they say plotted violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.The investigation into the attacks is one of the largest criminal investigations in the department's history, and comes as some conservatives continue to promote the false claim the riots were peaceful.\n\nTwo of the six defendants were convicted on the lesser charge of entering and remaining on restricted grounds.\n\nOn Tuesday, a mistrial was declared on the count of obstruction of an official proceeding against Michael Greene of Indiana.\n\nThe defendants were all convicted of entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds. Steele, Sandra Parker, Meggs and Isaacs were convicted of all charges, including preventing a member of Congress from doing their duty.\n\nThe guilty verdicts follow the seditious conspiracy convictions of six other Oath Keepers, including leader Stewart Rhodes and a top deputy, Kelly Meggs , who is Connie Meggs' husband. The six defendants on trial were not charged with sedition , or conspiring to oppose the authority of the government by force.\n\nBennie and Sandra Parker, a married couple and the oldest Ohioans charged in the Capitol riot , traveled to D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, as part of Oath Keeper Jessica Watkins' Ohio State Regular Militia, a dues-paying subset of the right-wing militia group. Watkins was tried with the first group of Oath Keepers and found guilty of four of the six charges she faced , including conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.\n\nGreene, who testified for the defense in the first Oath Keepers trial, was named an operations leader by Rhodes ahead of Jan. 6, according to prosecutors. He participated in a phone call that day between himself, Rhodes and Kelly Meggs; minutes after the call, a group of Oath Keepers entered the Capitol.\n\nSteele, a former North Carolina police officer, is the sister of Oath Keeper Graydon Young, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction charges in June 2021. Young testified for the government in the first Oath Keepers trial.\n\nDefense attorneys argued that Isaacs, a 23-year-old Oath Keeper with autism, \"hyper-fixated\" on his role as a \"security aid\" to former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn another courtroom of D.C.'s federal courthouse, members of the right-wing extremist group Proud Boys face trial for sedition . Prosecutors could rest their case as soon as next week."

      "text": "Oath Keepers are being sentenced for the Capitol riot. What to know about the far-right group members\n\nOath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes on Thursday was given the first sentence for a seditious conspiracy conviction in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack - 18 years in prison for plotting to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election so former President Donald Trump could stay in office.\n\nBut in coming days, eight other members of the right-wing militia group will be sentenced for crimes tied to the riot , from destruction of property to sedition.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said Thursday that the government intentionally charged the nine Oath Keepers with seditious conspiracy together; they all took \"leadership roles\" in both the right-wing militia group and the plot to block the 2020 election results, she said.\n\nHere are the prison sentences given to the Oath Keepers tried for sedition.\n\nProsecutors said in May that Rhodes sat at the top of the Oath Keepers' hierarchy, which is why they requested a sentence of 25 years for the right-wing militia group founder.\n\nDuring his sentencing , Rhodes called himself a \"political prisoner\" with \"preordained guilt from Day One.\" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who is overseeing the case, strongly rebuked Rhodes' criticism and expressed concern over Rhodes' influence.\n\n\"I never have said this to anyone I have sentenced: You pose an ongoing threat and peril to our democracy and the fabric of this country,\" he said before handing down the 18-year sentence.\n\nKelly Meggs was convicted of seditious conspiracy and other serious felonies alongside Rhodes.\n\nA Florida Oath Keepers leader and top lieutenant to Rhodes, Meggs was accused of paying for two Virginia hotel rooms where members of the right-wing militia stashed firearms for \"quick reaction force\" teams. Prosecutors said they planned to transport the weapons into D.C. if Trump invoked the Insurrection Act, a measure presidents can use to deploy troops, or if violence broke out.\n\nIn May, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his conduct. The DOJ sought a 21-year sentence.\n\nJessica Watkins, an Army veteran from Woodstock, Ohio , led her own militia group called the Ohio State Regular Militia, a \"dues-paying subset\" of the Oath Keepers. Prosecutors said she was a pivotal organizer of the attack, bringing weapons for the other members waiting in Virginia and entering the Capitol as part of the first group in tactical formation.\n\nWatkins was acquitted of seditious conspiracy but convicted of other serious felonies including conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging any duties.\n\nIn May, Watkins was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison. The DOJ requested an 18-year sentence.\n\nKenneth Harrelson, a welder and Florida resident , was accused of helping Meggs run the Florida Oath Keepers.\n\nHarrelson was acquitted of seditious conspiracy but convicted of other felonies, such as obstructing an official proceeding and conspiring to prevent an officer from discharging duties.\n\nIn May, Harrelson was sentenced to four years in prison for his conduct. The DOJ asked for a 15-year sentence.\n\nThomas Caldwell, a Navy veteran who once worked for the FBI , coordinated a planned armed response and engaged in reconnoitering the Capitol, prosecutors said. In the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, the Virginian sought a boat so if violence broke out, the Oath Keepers could transport weapons across the Potomac River into Washington.\n\nCaldwell was acquitted of seditious conspiracy, but he was convicted of obstructing an official proceeding and tampering with evidence.\n\nProsecutors are seeking a 14-year sentence for Caldwell. He was set to be sentenced in May, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta pushed the hearing to an unspecified date over efforts by his defense counsel to acquit him of some charges.\n\nRoberto Minuta, a New York tattoo shop owner living in Texas , was found guilty of seditious conspiracy and other serious felonies. Prosecutors said he raced across Washington in a golf cart with fellow Oath Keepers to join the Capitol attack after hearing that Trump supporters stormed the building.\n\nMinuta was sentenced to four and a half years in prison Thursday. The Justice Department recommended a 17-year sentence.\n\nEdward Vallejo, an Arizona Army veteran , was convicted of seditious conspiracy. Vallejo was accused of standing ready to deliver weapons from Virginia to D.C. if Rhodes told him to do so as part of a \"quick reaction force\" team.\n\nVallejo was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday, plus three years of supervised release - a year of which will be spent in home confinement. Prosecutors asked for a 17-year sentence.\n\nFloridian David Moerschel was convicted of seditious conspiracy .

      "text": "Proud Boys and Oath Keepers leaders are free. Who are they and what are their groups?\n\nOf the almost 1,600 people convicted in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, whose sentences were commuted or who received full pardons from President Donald Trump on Monday, arguably the two most high-profile prisoners were Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes.\n\nTarrio and Rhodes are, respectively, the leaders of the extremist street gang the Proud Boys and the founder and leader of the anti-government \"militia\" the Oath Keepers. Those two groups became synonymous with the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, and Tarrio and Rhodes received the longest sentences of anyone charged in the attack. Both men were prosecuted for helping plan the insurrection, and both were convicted of seditious conspiracy. Tarrio received a 22-year sentence. Rhodes got 18 years.\n\nBut who are these men?\n\nWhat did they want?\n\nAnd why are they getting so much attention now that they've been let out of prison?\n\nUSA TODAY has been covering Tarrio and Rhodes and investigating and writing about the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers for years. Their release marks just the latest twist in a long, strange road for both extremist leaders.\n\nTarrio, whose birth name is Henry, but who goes by Enrique, is a small businessman from Florida who rose to prominence in the year or so before the Capitol insurrection as the de facto leader of the Proud Boys.\n\nFounded in 2016 by former journalist and podcaster Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of VICE News, the Proud Boys bill themselves as a \"Western Chauvinist\" men's drinking club. Members of the group, which is estimated to have chapters in dozens of states , undergo a bizarre hazing ritual to join and can rise up the ranks of the organization to become \"second degree,\" \"third degree\" and \"fourth degree\" members by performing tasks including getting a Proud Boys tattoo and getting into a fight with anti-fascists.\n\nThe Proud Boys espouse a vague political ideology of unfettered free speech and nationalism, expressed through offensive language, controversial memes and shocking imagery. A 2021 USA TODAY investigation of the Wisconsin chapter of the group revealed it as a den of racism and antisemitism, where moving up within the group was dependent on sadistically bullying potential members and promoting white supremacist talking points.\n\nMcInnes has long claimed the Proud Boys was never meant to be a political organization, but as Donald Trump began his political ascendance, the group became popular among conservative young and middle-aged men across the country. Throughout Trump's first presidency, Proud Boys sporting the organization's black-and-gold clothing regularly engaged in street fights with leftist demonstrators and counterdemonstrators, leading to dozens of arrests and prosecutions. In 2018, the FBI categorized the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to white nationalism.\n\nVirulently pro-Trump, the Proud Boys were delighted when, during a televised debate in the 2020 election campaign the former president infamously told the group to \"stand back and stand by.\" After Trump lost the election, the Proud Boys helped spread falsities about election fraud and tampering on social media.\n\nTarrio, meanwhile, who had begun calling himself the \"Chairman\" of the group, was increasingly seen in political circles. He flew on private jets to events including at the White House . While he supported and promoted protests on Jan. 6 on his social media accounts, Tarrio was arrested on Jan. 4 in Washington, D.C., while on the phone with a USA TODAY journalist . He was charged with setting fire to a \"Black Lives Matter\" banner at a protest in December 2020.\n\nA judge in that case barred Tarrio from the District of Columbia and he was not present at the Capitol during the insurrection on Jan. 6. Nonetheless, in June 2022 he and four other Proud Boys were each charged with nine counts, including seditious conspiracy, in an organized plot to prevent the certification of President Joe Biden's election. Tarrio and three of his co-defendants were found guilty in May 2023 and in September 2023 Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison.\n\nAt the sentencing, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly agreed with prosecutors that Tarrio's actions could be punished more harshly as \"terrorism,\" for trying to influence the government through intimidation or coercion, but not at the level of trying to blow up buildings.\n\nProsecutors presented evidence saying Tarrio created a special wing of the Proud Boys called  the \"Ministry of Self Defense,\" which coordinated attacks on the day and celebrated them afterwards. \"Make no mistake ... we did this,\" Tarrio wrote at one point to the group.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tarrio played a \" central role \" in organizing the riot at the Capitol. Tarrio influenced many other Proud Boys to get involved in the attack, Garland said.\n\nThroughout his incarceration, Tarrio has maintained his innocence, calling himself a \"political prisoner.\"\n\nIf the Proud Boys are the U.S. far-right's street brawlers, the Oath Keepers are the movement's military vanguard, with Yale graduate, military veteran and eye-patch-wearing Elmer Stewart Rhodes serving as its general.\n\nJan. 6 marked for Rhodes the culmination of a long career of conspiracy spreading, self-aggrandizement and manipulation of thousands of dogged followers, many of whom saw his organization as a bulwark against an oppressive federal government.\n\nSince founding the Oath Keepers in 2009, Rhodes has painted himself as a hero for American conservatives, creating a public image of a gun-toting revolutionary with a private army willing to die for libertarian causes.\n\nThroughout the 2010s Rhodes built the Oath Keepers, which targets current and former law enforcement officers and military veterans, into a national brand recognized at gun fairs and even at police and sheriff's events around the country. He was a frequent guest and commentator on conspiracy theory platform Infowars and held recruitment events and training camps for budding Oath Keepers in the years leading up to the insurrection.\n\nUnlike Tarrio, Rhodes was present at the riot on Jan. 6. But unlike hundreds of other rioters, he didn't enter the Capitol. Prosecutors accused him of being one of the masterminds of the insurrection, pointing out that at his command, the Oath Keepers had left a stash of weapons in a motel room across the Potomac from the Capitol.\n\nDefiant to the end, Rhodes largely represented himself in court and launched angry tirades at the judge, who chastised him more than once .\n\nHe was found guilty of seditious conspiracy in November 2022 and sentenced to 18 years in federal prison.\n\nIn the four years since the insurrection, both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers have been muted in their activity, researchers who study the groups told USA TODAY.\n\nWithout Rhodes at the helm, the Oath Keepers have largely disappeared, said Travis McAdam, manager of research and analysis at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. By contrast, the Proud Boys have maintained a presence across the country, said Cassie Miller, a senior manager of research and analysis on the project.\n\nMcAdam and Miller, who have monitored online and real-life activity by the two groups for close to a decade, said it's too early to tell whether the release of Tarrio, Rhodes and other senior extremist leaders will spark new interest in them.\n\n\"It remains to be seen if they're going to be rejuvenated,\" Miller told USA TODAY about the Proud Boys. \"The group is not well organized and after Jan. 6, they really retreated from large-scale national actions.\"\n\nIn January 2021, Tarrio was revealed as having previously worked as a federal informant, a background that did not sit well with many members of the Proud Boys, Miller said. His \"leadership\" - such as it was - of the organization has been called into question throughout his incarceration, she said, though no obvious successor has come to the fore.\n\nThe Oath Keepers are similarly fragmented, if not even more so, McAdam said. An offshoot of the original group, called Oath Keepers USA, has had some success recruiting members, he said, but without the charismatic Rhodes calling the shots, the organization has gone downhill.\n\nRhodes, who had already begun writing online before his release, with an eye on a pardon, will likely take leadership of his group anew now that he is free, McAdam said. Unlike Tarrio, he is largely viewed as a martyr by current and former Oath Keepers and the broader anti-government \"militia\" movement, he said.\n\n\"Stuart Rhodes is coming out of this a hero,\" McAdam said. \"There are a lot of people talking about how he and others were political prisoners that were persecuted, and how Trump has righted this wrong and they're finally getting justice.\""

      "text": "Trump's Jan. 6 pardons fly 'in the face of the facts' of violent insurrection | Opinion\n\nIn the first hours of his second term, President Donald Trump pardoned nearly everyone convicted of crimes associated with the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol - including former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio - and commuted the sentences of 14 more, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes.\n\nCNN reported that nearly 1,600 people have been charged and about 1,300 have been convicted of crimes committed on that day. There are about 300 cases \"still active and unresolved,\" CNN reported.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post analysis, 14 leaders of far-right militant groups Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have been convicted of seditious conspiracy . And 379 people have been charged with felony assault; most of them have been convicted already, though some are still awaiting trial. Trump also ordered the Justice Department to dismiss all pending indictments against Jan. 6 defendants.\n\nTo understand the situation, Jeff Inglis, a politics editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with John E. Jones III , a retired federal judge who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2002. Jones is now president of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\n\nQuestion: What's the difference between a pardon and a commutation?\n\nAnswer: A pardon essentially wipes away the offense and restores the constitutional rights that a person convicted of a federal felony crime would be deprived of, such as the right to vote and to travel unimpeded. Technically, it does not mean they're not guilty of the offense, but it washes away all the consequences of the offense.\n\nA pardon can be anticipatory, but in most cases historically it's given after a person has been convicted of a crime, or at least charged.\n\nA commutation means that, essentially, the president believes the sentence is too harsh or too long. The commutation could either let somebody out of jail immediately and terminate their sentence or could shorten the amount of time remaining for them to serve.\n\nThe key difference is that a commutation doesn't change the fact of a conviction and doesn't wash away the consequences.\n\nWhat do judges think about a president exercising the power to pardon and commute?\n\nThere have been instances historically where judges probably have agreed with commutations and pardons. It's typically not ever top of mind when you sentence people that someone is going to commute that sentence or pardon. It's a pretty rare occurrence.\n\nI will say that in my experience, if someone was angling for a commutation or pardon without any sense of gratitude or remorse, that would be more difficult to swallow for the judge who passed the sentence.\n\nWhat do judges think about Trump's actions in these Jan. 6 cases?\n\nIn many cases, these judges sentenced the offenders to less than what the government was asking for. They gave them a break and went below the advisory sentencing guidelines that judges have to consult when they pass sentence. They're not mandatory, but judges have to explain why they've sentenced outside the guidelines when they pass sentences. The Department of Justice wanted sentences at the upper end of the guidelines because of the conduct of the individuals.\n\nWhen it comes to Jan. 6 offenders, not only do I think they received appropriate due process, but in some cases, I believe they received excessive due process.\n\nFor example, look at the case of a person from Pennsylvania named Joseph W. Fischer . Fischer is a former police officer , and he was charged, among other things, with obstructing the business of Congress by damaging or destroying items. He argued that his actions did not meet the criteria of obstructing Congress and took his case all the way to the Supreme Court, which sided with Fischer. He had access to the courts. He had good lawyers. He took the case all the way up and was able to rid himself of that particular charge.\n\nI think the judges were fully capable and did, in fact, sentence according to the degree of conduct of the offenders.\n\nYou're a retired federal judge. How does this action of pardoning and commutation of this group of people make you think about the justice system?\n\nTwo of the purposes of sentencing are deterrence and respect for the law.\n\nTaking deterrence first, imagine you are an individual who believes that taking the law into your own hands and attempting to interfere with the business of government is the right way to proceed when you disagree with the result. The message that blanket pardons or commutations sends is essentially: You can get away with those actions without penalty, because your benefactor is going to save you in the end.\n\nRespect for the law is another aspect. What I'm hearing from a number of incarcerated folks who say they expect to be pardoned or have their sentences commuted is that they don't believe they've done anything wrong. Might those same individuals engage in similar behavior at another time, thinking that they can do that with impunity?\n\nI think Trump is going to make these people into martyrs and heroes, and to my mind, that flies in the face of the facts of these cases. Video footage shows several scenes from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nHow do you think about Trump's Jan. 6 pardons and commutations alongside the pardons and commutations that former President Joe Biden issued on the way out the door?\n\nIt's really troublesome. Setting aside my judicial career and history and career in the law, the fact of the matter is, the general public just sees dozens and dozens, if not hundreds, of pardons.\n\nIt is probably true that we're seeing an overuse of the pardon power at this point, maybe more than we've ever seen in history.\n\nI think Biden pardoning his family members was bad for him. If you're going to do it, do it in the light of day. There's still a bad taste in many people's mouths about Hunter Biden's pardon .\n\nI see the point: He's taking Trump's threats of retribution seriously. The Justice Department could convene grand juries and investigate folks, and whether they were bona fide charges or not, it would cost them millions of dollars in legal fees. In the case of Hunter Biden, I guess any parent has empathy. It's his son, and he had the power to do it. It's sort of a tortured situation.\n\nBut then I think about all of us on Jan. 6, 2021, turning on the TV and seeing something that we've never seen before in history. It is rare that something happens for the first time in history, and that searing image is stuck in a lot of folks' brains.\n\nI think you absolutely can logically and factually differentiate them. But I don't know if that's what's going to happen in the court of public opinion.\n\nJohn E. Jones III is a retired federal judge and the president of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

      "text": "Freed by Trump, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers plan to sue DOJ\n\nWASHINGTON - More than four years after the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the two men federal prosecutors charged as the principal leaders of the riot were back to announce they're suing the Justice Department.\n\nHenry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, de-facto leader of the extremist street gang the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes , founder of the militant anti-government group the Oath Keepers, were joined by several other Jan. 6 defendants at a chaotic roadside press conference in front of the Capitol on Friday.\n\nAs counter-protestors chanted insults through bullhorns, Tarrio said he and four other Proud Boys plan to sue the Justice Department for malicious prosecution over their conviction and imprisonment for seditious conspiracy. Last month, President Donald Trump commuted the sentences of Tarrio and Rhodes and pardoned or commuted the sentences of almost 1,600 other Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nTarrio said he was seeking \"retribution\" for the years he and his fellow Proud Boys spent in prison.\n\n\"They suffered for three years, and those who made them suffer will pay,\" Tarrio said. \"That is why today we are announcing a lawsuit against the DOJ for their murders, their lies and the endless suffering they have put us through.\"\n\nTarrio and Rhodes were both convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the storming of the Capitol while legislators certified Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over President Trump. They received sentences of 22 and 18 years respectively. Rhodes said he too will be suing the DOJ in a separate lawsuit, but gave no details.\n\nAfter the press conference, Tarrio was arrested by Capitol police for allegedly swiping his hand at a protester.\n\nTarrio was joined by fellow Proud Boys Joe Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola, all of whom were imprisoned for their roles in the riot and freed by Trump last month. The five men are all plaintiffs in the coming lawsuit, Tarrio said.\n\nThe proposed litigation could set the stage for an extraordinary showdown - or climbdown - between the Jan. 6 convicts and the DOJ.\n\nOrdinarily, the department would quickly swat away such a lawsuit, legal experts told USA TODAY. But in the current administration, they said, it's unclear what path it will take. Trump has shown consistent support for the Jan. 6 rioters, calling them \"political prisoners.\"\n\nTrump could order the DOJ to allow the lawsuit to continue, rather than filing motions to have it dismissed, said Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. Trump could also order the department to compensate the convicted seditionists, he said.\n\n\"Given that they've been convicted, it sounds like a frivolous suit,\" Chemerisky said \"But could Trump order it be settled? Of course.\"\n\nProsecutors are generally protected from such lawsuits by a host of immunity doctrines, Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said.\n\n\"The DOJ could decide to settle the case and pay some damages, but if the DOJ decides to fight it I think they would have some very strong grounds,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for President Trump told USA TODAY the administration doesn't comment on hypotheticals and noted that a lawsuit has not yet been filed.\n\nRhodes, who led a team of Oath Keepers to the Capitol and whose followers stashed a cache of weapons in a motel room across the Potomac on January 6 for easy access, said he will also file a lawsuit against the DOJ.\n\nTarrio suggested the Proud Boys could be joined by hundreds more Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n\"We do have a lawyer. We'll be announcing that in the coming weeks, but right now, there's the five of us,\" he said. \"To be honest with you, I think you're gonna see 1,600 people sue the DOJ in one form or another, whether it's class action or personal.\""

Three of the four - Minuta, Hackett and Moerschel - were acquitted of lesser charges.\n\nMonday's outcome follows November convictions on the same rare charge of two other Oath Keepers, leader Stewart Rhodes and a top deputy , Kelly Meggs. Three other Oath Keepers were acquitted of seditious conspiracy in that trial, but found guilty of other charges.\n\nProsecutors argued in the six-week trial that the Oath Keepers on trial worked in tandem with other members of the right-wing militia group to storm the Capitol and stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\n\"They talked together, they acted together, they deleted together,\" said Louis Manzo, a trial attorney serving as special assistant U.S. attorney.\n\nBut defense attorneys for the four Oath Keepers suggested the government \"cherry-picked\" evidence, assembling messages and videos together in whichever way made the defendants look as guilty as possible.\n\nLegally, seditious conspiracy occurs when two or more people conspire to \"overthrow, put down or to destroy by force\" the U.S. government or bring war against it, or plot to use force to oppose the authority of the government or to block the execution of a law.\n\nIt's one of 57 federal crimes under the terrorism enhancement statute and can carry a 20-year prison sentence along with a maximum fine of $20,000.\n\nBefore the sedition convictions of Rhodes and Meggs, the government had not won a guilty verdict on the charge since 1995.\n\nProsecutors argued in closing remarks Wednesday that the four Oath Keepers on trial subscribed to a \"perverted version of American history\" that led them to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when they stormed the building in aim of stopping the certification of the 2020 election.\n\nAfter that, the conspiracy continued, the government alleged, showing evidence the defendants planned to continue efforts to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Biden.\n\n\"Jan. 6 was just a battle,\" Manzo told the jury. \"The full conspiracy was to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\"\n\nDefense attorneys argued Thursday that the government \"cherry-picked\" evidence to portray the defendants in a negative light, building their case on \"selective evidence and scary words.\"\n\n\"This case is about a narrative in search of evidence,\" said William Shipley, defense attorney for Minuta.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"

      "text": "What is seditious conspiracy, which is among the most serious crimes Trump pardoned?\n\nManage your account\n\nSeveral of the highest-profile figures in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection were charged with, and convicted of, the crime of seditious conspiracy, which is defined as the act of getting together with other people to overthrow the government. They were among the roughly 1,500 people involved in the insurrection who were pardoned or had their prison sentences commuted by Donald Trump on his first day in office.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is a serious crime of conspiring to overthrow the government or stop its normal functioning. Historically, seditious conspiracy has been difficult to successfully prosecute .\n\nIn 2009, for example, a state judge ruled that prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient evidence for members of the Michigan Hutaree militia to go to trial on that charge. Certain militia members had been accused of plotting violence against police officers. While some members faced other charges for their actions, the judge determined that a plot against law enforcement was not sufficient to support charges of attempting to overthrow the government.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. Department of Justice charged 18 people associated with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol with that crime, asserting that they had intended to \" oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power\" or had committed other actions that would undermine the entire system of government.\n\nOf those 18, four pleaded guilty , and 10 were found guilty at trial . The remaining four were found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but were convicted of other crimes that were related to the insurrection.\n\nOath Keepers militia leader Stewart Rhodes' seditious conspiracy conviction was especially significant because, unlike some other defendants, Rhodes did not physically enter the Capitol building . He was instead in \"the restricted area of Capitol grounds,\" according to a Justice Department statement.\n\nHis conviction was based in part on his communications, including text messages, both before Jan. 6 and on the day itself. Prosecutors successfully argued that these communications were part of a broader conspiracy to disrupt the election certification by organizing and encouraging others to participate in more direct action.\n\nMany observers believed successful prosecutions for these charges sent a strong message that violence against a democratically elected government was not acceptable.\n\nScholars of militia activity like me saw a period of relative quiet through much of Joe Biden's presidency, which was, in part, likely due to the consequences the Jan. 6 defendants faced.\n\nSome groups, however, continued social media discussions of their beliefs that the 2020 election had been \"stolen,\" as Trump continues to falsely claim , and which was used as justification by militia members for their attack. Trump himself said publicly he thought the defendants were unjustly persecuted and promised to pardon them if and when he returned to power.\n\nThe full effect that the pardons will have on militia actors and related groups in coming years is uncertain: Will the pardons send the message to all Americans that political violence is acceptable, or at least that it can be overlooked or forgiven if the right political figures are in power?\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation , a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

      "text": "Trump Suggests Frightening New Charges Against Judges Who Oppose Him\n\nManage your account\n\nDonald Trump has escalated his attacks on judges ruling against his administration, suggesting that they could be charged with sedition and treason.\n\nThe president reposted an article from Gateway Pundit, a right-wing website known for trafficking in hoaxes and conspiracy theories , on his Truth Social account Sunday. The article attempts to make a legal argument that federal judges who rule against Trump's policies and executive orders can be prosecuted for sedition and treason.\n\nThe article makes wild claims about federal law concerning treason and seditious conspiracy, claiming that judges collaborating \"with foreign or domestic entities to undermine national security-related executive decisions\" would justify treason charges, while judges \"intentionally obstruct[ing] executive functions and conspir[ing] to weaken presidential authority\" could constitute seditious conspiracy.\n\nGoing even further, the article's writer, Yaacov Apelbaum, argued that if judges' rulings are \"severely undermining the federal government's operations,\" that could constitute \"aiding enemies or direct rebellion\" under Article 3 of the Constitution.\n\nIf the president is giving serious weight to these legal theories, that goes far beyond his previous threats to impeach judges he doesn't like, which has been echoed by Elon Musk and other right-wing figures and drawn a mealy-mouthed condemnation from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIt also suggests that Trump will stop at nothing to continue issuing legally questionable executive orders, which have decimated federal agencies created and regulated by Congress, and rushed through mass deportations and immigration penalties that very likely violate federal law and the Constitution . If Trump finds a way to sideline, impeach, or charge federal judges when they rule against him, he will have decimated the constitutional separation of powers and cemented himself as a dictator."

      "text": "Enrique Tarrio, Proud Boys Leader In Prison For Seditious Conspiracy, Begs Trump For Pardon\n\nManage your account\n\nHenry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 22 years in prison, has requested a full and complete pardon from President-elect Donald Trump on the fourth anniversary of the attack on the U.S. Capitol that he had a hand in orchestrating.\n\nNayib Hassan, Tarrio's lawyer, wrote Monday in a letter to Trump that the former leader of the extremist group is a \"young man with an aspiring future ahead of him,\" and argued that Tarrio was \"portrayed throughout the government's case as a right-wing extremist that promoted a neo-fascist militant organization.\" Hassan wrote that because Tarrio was arrested on Jan. 4, 2021, for unrelated charges, and was ordered out of Washington, D.C., he did not \"partake in the rally that took place on January 6, 2021.\"\n\nHassan also lamented that his client has been placed in a special housing unit in prison where he can \"only see the outside of his cell for one hour a day,\" and argued that this is a \"cruel and an unusual punishment\" that has negatively affected Tarrio's mental health.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the government pushed forward charging and prosecuting Henry, along with four individuals in the same trial, for expressing their freedom of expression,\" the letter states.\n\nTarrio was convicted in May 2023 for seditious conspiracy and a slew of other charges, including conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to prevent officials from discharging their duties, impeding officers during civil disorder and more. At the months-long trial , prosecutors argued that Tarrio purposefully entered D.C. on Jan. 4 to be arrested for his destruction of a Black Lives Matter banner some three weeks earlier. It was, prosecutors said, a convenient way to establish an alibi for his whereabouts on Jan. 6.\n\nLast month, former D.C. Metropolitan Police Lt. Shane Lamond was convicted of obstructing justice and lying to federal investigators about leaking insider information to Tarrio in the days leading up to the Capitol attack. Through hundreds of text messages, prosecutors showed an intimate relationship between the men, with Lamond calling Tarrio \"brother\" and alerting the Proud Boys leader that a warrant for his arrest for the destruction of the banner was likely.\n\nIndeed, Tarrio was not at the Capitol as it came under siege. Instead, he was watching the action from a hotel room in Baltimore, busily texting with other Proud Boys and whipping people into a frenzy on social media. Tarrio did not have to be at the site of the riot to sanction what unfolded there, Assistant U.S. Attorney Connor Mulroe argued at trial. Mulroe also reminded jurors that at no point on Jan. 6 did Tarrio tell Proud Boys to stand down or not to be violent.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" Tarrio wrote to members of Proud Boys leadership as he watched the chaos. \"We did this.\"\n\nTarrio also posted messages on the social media site Parler, writing \"Don't fucking leave,\" \"Proud of my boys\" and \"1776.\" In an encrypted and exclusive Proud Boys group text channel created by Tarrio, known as the \"Ministry of Self Defense,\" he gushed on Jan. 6: \"Proud of y'all.\"\n\nHours after the havoc and bloodshed had finally ended, Tarrio posted a video of himself online. The clip shows him standing in front of the Capitol with his face partially covered. He shot the video on Jan. 5 and waited until Jan. 6 to post it, with the caption: \"Premonition.\"\n\nWhen the riot was over, he expressed no remorse.\n\n\"I'm not denouncing shit,\" Tarrio said .\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he will pardon Jan. 6 rioters, though he has hedged about whether he intends to issue pardons en masse or if he will review the cases individually.\n\nMany federal judges, congresspeople and legal experts have condemned the idea of blanket pardons for Jan. 6 rioters, and particularly those rioters who were violent and who committed the most serious charge to emerge from all Jan. 6 prosecutions: seditious conspiracy.\n\nLast month, a federal judge who oversaw the seditious conspiracy trial and conviction of Oath Keepers leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes warned that the prospect of total absolution for Rhodes' actions \"is frightening and ought to be frightening to anyone who cares about democracy in this country.\"\n\nRhodes is serving an 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges.\n\nIn an interview with The Times published Sunday, Tarrio's mother, Zuny Tarrio, said she hopes Trump will pardon her son.\n\n\"My hope is 100 per cent that my child will be pardoned,\" she said. \"I believe in Donald Trump's word - he knows who his supporters were and are.\"\n\nSome Jan. 6 rioters have expressed remorse for their actions while being sentenced. Others have pointedly declined to do so.\n\nLast January, when Proud Boy Marc Bru was sentenced to six years in prison for obstruction of an official proceeding, civil disorder and more, he told the judge : \"You could give me 100 years and I would still do it all over again.\"\n\nDominic Pezzola, a Proud Boy charged alongside Tarrio and considered the \"tip of the spear\" that first led rioters into the Capitol, was tearful at his sentencing, proclaiming there was \"no place in my future for groups or politics whatsoever.\"\n\nLiteral minutes later, before he exited the courtroom to be led off to prison, Pezzola pumped his fist in the air and shouted: \"Trump won!\"\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, as of Monday, approximately 1,583 defendants have been charged with federal crimes connected to Jan. 6, including 608 charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers and 174 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n\nCorrupt Cop With Ties To Proud Boys Leader Found Guilty\n\nProud Boys Leader Enrique Tarrio Sentenced In Jan. 6 Attack\n\nTrump's Jan. 6 Pardon Promise Would Put Police-Assaulters Back On The Streets"

The sentence, the longest yet for a Jan. 6 defendant, was the first handed down among the handful of rioters convicted of seditious conspiracy , and the first augmented with a \"terrorism\" enhancement.

      "text": "Seditious Oath Keeper Who'd Been Tapped As Roger Stone's Security Guard Gets Probation\n\nManage your account\n\nJoshua James, a former Oath Keeper chapter leader and Army veteran from Alabama who pleaded guilty to engaging in a seditious conspiracy to stop the transfer of power on Jan. 6, 2021, was sentenced to three years of probation on Friday.\n\nThe lenient sentence was thanks to James' early cooperation with the Justice Department.\n\nInitially indicted alongside Oath Keeper leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes and several other members of the far-right group charged with seditious conspiracy, the Arab, Alabama, man broke ranks in March 2022. James pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and to a single charge of obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\nAs part of that plea deal, prosecutors agreed to dismiss other charges James faced, including a document-tampering charge. The bargain that James struck drastically reduced the number of years he could have faced if he went to trial and was convicted of sedition.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge alone carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison. (Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years.)\n\nWhen James first pleaded guilty, prosecutors told a federal judge they would seek a sentence of nine years, but in the time since that deal was struck, prosecutors departed significantly. In a memorandum submitted to the court ahead of sentencing, prosecutors told presiding U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta just 24 months, or two years of incarceration, three years of supervised release and a fine of $2,000 were acceptable. Mehta departed from that on Friday, agreeing that he should be given only the probation.\n\nJames admitted key information to prosecutors that helped convict nearly a dozen members of the extremist group on numerous charges. He disclosed that the Oath Keepers had plotted to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory from as early as November 2020, when he, Rhodes and others met at Oath Keeper associate and Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell's farm in Virginia to hash out their strategy.\n\nDuring the Oath Keepers' seditious conspiracy trial in 2022, Caldwell insisted he was never part of the network and often grew emotional or combative on the witness stand as he denied his involvement with the group as well as any suggestion that he deleted incriminating texts or communications with other members. Ultimately, Caldwell was acquitted of the seditious conspiracy charge, though he was convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding and tampering with documents. When the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the interpretation of the obstruction charge in Fischer v. United States earlier this year, Caldwell's obstruction charge was dropped. Now 69 years old, Caldwell has been awaiting sentencing for over a year. He was supposed to be sentenced on Friday, but prosecutors on Thursday requested a delay.\n\nAs for James, he admitted that during regular discussions with the group, including discussions Caldwell was privy to, there was never a question about whether the Oath Keepers were willing to use any means necessary to stop the transfer of power, including \"lethal force.\"\n\nJames admitted the Oath Keepers were willing to use lethal force against anyone who tried to remove Donald Trump from the White House, and that included the National Guard.\n\nJames also disclosed in his plea deal how Rhodes and fellow Oath Keepers gathered and transported a staggering number of guns, ammunition and tactical gear to a hotel in northern Virginia. It was meant to be the group's \"quick reaction force\" ― whether Trump invoked the Insurrection Act or if Rhodes alone ordered them to spring into action.\n\nAhead of Jan. 6, 2021, James was one of several Oath Keepers who kept contact with Roger Stone , a longtime friend and adviser to Trump, including while the GOP operative was in Washington on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6.\n\nOath Keepers escorted Stone to a rally on Jan. 5 in Washington, serving as his security force.\n\nWhen the rioting at the U.S. Capitol erupted on Jan. 6, Stone was at the Willard Hotel in Washington with James and other Oath Keepers. James quickly left Stone and took off in a golf cart driven by another Oath Keeper, Roberto Minuta. Rhodes had told them for weeks up to that point that if they were called upon, they were to immediately drop what they were doing and head to the White House to secure a perimeter for Trump.\n\nMinuta and James sped past and through police barricades as they headed toward the Capitol. In a live-streamed video during the golf-cart ride that was entered into evidence at Minuta's seditious conspiracy trial, Minuta could be heard saying they were going to the Capitol because they had received word that people had breached the building.\n\nJames was part of a group of Oath Keepers who marched up the Capitol steps in a stack formation before breaking into the building. Video footage showed James leading Minuta farther into the Capitol where the men would assault and taunt police. Footage from a body-worn camera on a D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officer, prosecutors said, showed James yelling at officers and pushing them violently. At one point, the officer is heard telling James to leave while he pants and says he cannot breathe.\n\nAfter the Capitol attack, James stayed in contact with Rhodes and followed Rhodes' instructions to delete encrypted texts shared among members of the group. James directly told other Oath Keepers to delete communications, too, and remove messages from their chats that included photos that might show their faces.\n\nJames stayed with Rhodes in Texas for a few weeks after Jan. 6. He was Rhodes' security guard. Rhodes gave James a burner phone and told him to use a fake identity when he used the phone. In the weeks before the inauguration, James accompanied Rhodes on numerous trips where Rhodes purchased more firearms, ammunition, scopes, holsters and tactical equipment.\n\nJames told Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs - also later convicted of seditious conspiracy - to \"stay below the radar\" as they awaited instructions for their next steps. James finally left Rhodes in Texas in early February. Biden had been inaugurated and Rhodes feared arrest, prosecutors wrote in James' sentencing memorandum this month.\n\nRhodes told James to be ready for \"civil war\" and sent him back home to Alabama. Rhodes asked him to store their gear in a shed once he got there and await further instruction.\n\nJames agreed.\n\nAccording to Politico , James offered a tearful apology at his sentencing on Friday.\n\nMore than 1,500 people have been prosecuted in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, but those charged and convicted of seditious conspiracy are in an elite group of defendants. It was the most serious charge to emerge.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has indicated he will pardon Jan. 6 rioters when he takes office in January. It is unclear if those who plotted to stop the transfer of power after the 2020 election will be included.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that James was sentenced to two years of incarceration.\n\nA Federal Judge Just Issued A 'Frightening' Warning About 1 Of Trump's Plans\n\nAn Oath Keeper Who Helped Feds Prosecute Seditious Conspiracy Cases Is Finally Sentenced\n\nJustice Department Watchdog Finds No FBI Agents Or Informants Involved In Jan. 6 Riot"

      "text": "Navy vet cleared of Jan. 6 conspiracy charges sentenced to time served\n\nManage your account\n\nA retired Navy intelligence officer who was cleared of the most serious charges in his U.S. Capitol attack trial alongside Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes avoided additional time behind bars when he was sentenced Friday.\n\nThomas Caldwell was acquitted by a jury in Washington's federal court of seditious conspiracy and two other conspiracy offenses in one of the most serious cases brought by the Justice Department in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. And one of two counts he was found guilty on at trial was dismissed in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.\n\nVeterans involved in Jan. 6 riot expect Trump to keep pardon promise\n\nProsecutors had alleged at trial that Caldwell helped coordinate \"quick reaction force\" teams prosecutors said the Oath Keepers stationed outside the capital city to get weapons into the hands of extremists if they were needed. The weapons were never deployed, and lawyers for the Oath Keepers said they were only there for defensive purposes in case of attacks from left-wing activists.\n\nBut Caldwell, who didn't enter the Capitol, took the witness stand and played down messages he sent leading up to Jan. 6, including one floating the idea about getting a boat to ferry \"heavy weapons\" across the Potomac River. Caldwell said he was never serious about it, calling it \"creative writing.\"\n\nHis lawyer noted at trial that Caldwell was a disabled veteran who sometimes uses a cane to walk, telling jurors he \"couldn't storm his way out of a paper bag.\" Attorney David Fischer argued that there was no plot to attack the Capitol, saying his client wasn't even planning to go to the building until Trump's speech on the Ellipse urging his supporters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\nProsecutors had sought four years in prison for Caldwell on his remaining obstruction of justice offense conviction for deleting messages after the riot. Prosecutors described him in court papers as \"an avid and willing participant in an unprecedented crime.\"\n\nCaldwell's attorney told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in court documents that his client's acquittal on the conspiracy charges and \"military service that resulted in a lifetime of debilitating injuries\" call for a sentence of time served. He spent more than 50 days behind bars after his 2021 arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Caldwell was cleared of the four most serious counts and sentenced to no additional jail time by a highly respected federal judge,\" Fischer said in an email. \"Obviously, he should be considered for a pardon by President Trump.\"\n\nTrump has suggested he will pardon at least a large portion of the than 1,500 people who have been charged with federal crimes in the largest investigation in Justice Department history.\n\nRhodes, the Oath Keepers founder, is among 14 defendants who were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said were violent plots to keep Trump in power . Rhodes is serving an 18-year prison sentence."

Prosecutors argued he directed his troops remotely with messages about revolution and telling them \"don't f---ing leave\" after the building was breached that afternoon.\n\nHe was accused of orchestrating a fighting force with a group they called the \"Ministry of Self Defense\" comprised of dedicated Proud Boys and top leaders.\n\nTarrio's conviction follows the case of Stewart Rhodes, leader of another far-right group called Oath Keepers, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the events of Jan. 6.\n\nVideo of the two ringleaders meeting in a Washington parking garage on the eve of Jan. 6 was part of the volumes of footage obtained by the Justice Department in the case.\n\nMembership in the Proud Boys surged after then-President Donald Trump told the group to \"stand back and stand by\" during a 2020 presidential debate. Tarrio's attorneys blamed Trump for encouraging and revving up the crowd that ultimately broke into the Capitol.\n\nThe case is a win for authorities pursuing the hundreds of rioters who breached the Capitol. More than 1,000 arrests have been made in connection with Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department.\n\n\"Today's verdict makes clear that the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, adding, \"our work will continue.\"\n\nThursday was the seventh day of deliberations during which jurors asked multiple questions.\n\nWith dozens of witnesses and mountains of video and social media evidence, the Proud Boys trial has been the longest to date in the Justice Department's pursuit of Capitol rioters.\n\nSince jury selection began in December, the case has dragged on with bitter arguments, frequent objections and mistrial motions. At times, Judge Kelly lost his temper and admonished the lawyers for interrupting or seeming to ignore his directions.\n\nMORE: Proud Boys saw surge in membership after Trump's debate message, former member testifies\n\nThe Proud Boys insisted there were no plans to attack the Capitol and sought to cast themselves as nothing more than a hard-charging social club in which partying, drinking and exchanging crude jokes went along with attending political protests.\n\nThe group also describes themselves as \"Western chauvinists,\" an unapologetic brand of fervent nationalism.\n\nProsecutors emphasized to the jury that the Proud Boys did not need to have detailed -- or successful -- plans to be found guilty. The conspiracy allegations hinged on their mutual understanding to oppose the government by force.\n\nABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.\n\nProud Boys convicted of Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"

      "text": "What is seditious conspiracy? Rare, but now part of Jan. 6\n\nManage your account\n\nSedition, conspiracy. Those big words are now being used in Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection criminal cases after prosecutors charged 11 people Thursday.\n\nBut what do the terms mean, anyway?\n\nSeditious conspiracy occurs when two or more people in the U.S. conspire to \"overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force\" the U.S. government, or to levy war against it, or to oppose by force and try to prevent the execution of any law. If convicted, it's 20 years behind bars.\n\nBut that Civil War-era charge is rarely ever used, because it's hard to prove and harder to win.\n\nStill, prosecutors filed seditious conspiracy charges Thursday against the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group and 10 suspected associates one of just a few in the nation's history.\n\nThe last such case was filed in 2010 against members of a Michigan militia, but two years later they were acquitted by a judge who said their hateful diatribes didn't prove they ever had detailed plans for a rebellion.\n\nIt's different from a conspiracy charge, alone where two or more people work together to commit a crime. Plenty of people have been charged and convicted of conspiracy, and there currently are two major conspiracy cases in the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nSeditious conspiracy, though, is legally complex and there's a historical difficulty in securing convictions, and legal scholars say prosecutors are sometimes reluctant to file the charges. Overzealousness in applying them going back centuries has also discredited their use.\n\nIn the Jan. 6 case, it lends gravity to the accusations of violence and terror that day, and rebuts, in part, claims by some Republicans that the riot wasn't as serious because no one had yet been charged with sedition.\n\nStewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder and leader, is the highest-ranking member of an extremist group arrested so far. He did not enter the Capitol building that day, but is accused of helping to put the violence into motion. An attorney for Rhodes called the charges \"unusual\" and \"unfortunate.\"\n\nAlong those lines there's also treason - which is to levy war against the U.S. or to give U.S. enemies \"aid and comfort.\" No one has been charged with treason in the Jan. 6 riot and it's very rarely used.\n\nThough authorities have said the Oath Keepers and their associates worked as if they were going to war, discussing weapons and training. Days before the attack, one defendant suggested in a text message getting a boat to ferry weapons across the Potomac River to their \"waiting arms,\" prosecutors say.\n\nHere are some notable treason and sedition cases from years past:\n\nHUTAREE MILITIA\n\nThe last time U.S. prosecutors brought such a case was in 2010 in an alleged Michigan plot by members of the Hutaree militia to incite an uprising against the government. But a judge ordered acquittals on the sedition conspiracy charges at a 2012 trial, saying prosecutors relied too much on hateful diatribes protected by the First Amendment and didn't, as required, prove the accused ever had detailed plans for a rebellion. Three members of the militia pleaded guilty to weapons charges.\n\n___\n\nPUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS\n\nAmong the last successful convictions for seditious conspiracy charges were in another, now largely forgotten storming of the Capitol building in 1954. Four pro-independence Puerto Rican activists rushed the building and opened fire on the House floor, wounding several representatives. They and more than a dozen others who assisted in the attack were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nOscar Lopez Rivera, a former leader of a Puerto Rican independence group that orchestrated a bombing campaign that left dozens of people dead or maimed in the 1970s and 1980s, spent 35 years in prison for seditious conspiracy before President Barack Obama commuted his sentence in 2017.\n\n___\n\nSHEIKH OMAR ABDEL-RAHMAN\n\nSeditious conspiracy law was last successfully used in the 1990s in the prosecution of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb New York City landmarks. An Egyptian cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, and nine followers were convicted in 1995 of seditious conspiracy and other charges in a plot to blow up the United Nations, the FBI's building, and two tunnels and a bridge linking New York and New Jersey. Abdel-Rahman, known as the \"Blind Sheikh,\" argued on appeal that he was never involved in planning actual attacks against the U.S. and his hostile rhetoric was protected free speech. He died in federal prison in 2017.\n\n___\n\nTOKYO ROSE\n\nAmong the last convictions for treason was American-born Iva Toguri D'Aquino, known as Tokyo Rose during World War II for her anti-American broadcasts. She was convicted in 1949 of \"giving aid and comfort\" to Japan. She served more than six years of a 10-year sentence before her release. President Gerald Ford pardoned her after reports U.S. authorities pressured some witnesses to lie. Some former prisoners of war in Japan also came forward to confirm that D'Aquino had smuggled food and medicine to them during their capture.\n\nSeveral other Americans of Japanese and German descent were convicted of treason for giving aid and comfort to Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. Some also later received pardons or had sentences commuted.\n\n___\n\nADAM GADAHN\n\nThe only American charged with treason against the U.S. since the World II era was Adam Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American. His 2006 federal indictment said he gave al-Qaida \"aid and comfort ... with intent to betray the United States.\" Before he could be put on trial, Gadahn was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan."

Both sentences were a significant departure from the 17 years the government requested for each defendant after the two were convicted earlier this year of sedition and conspiracy to derail Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nProsecutors argued Minuta was a key leader of the \"second wave\" of Oath Keepers who stormed the Capitol. He was joined by Joshua James, who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy last year.\n\nAs part of his guilty plea, James admitted he and fellow members brought weapons, including a rifle, shotgun, semi-automatic handgun and ammunition to the greater Washington, D.C., area. James acknowledged he breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, intending to stop the electoral college certification, with Minuta by his side.\n\nMORE: Oath Keeper is 1st to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy for Jan. 6, will cooperate with prosecutors\n\nAt his sentencing, Minuta flatly denied any knowledge of plans between Oath Keepers, including the stockpile some had amassed at a Virginia hotel.\n\n\"I did not know about any guns in Virginia whatsoever,\" Minuta said.\n\nMinuta continued to insist he went into the Capitol to help police officers in distress. He apologized to the judge for entering the building.\n\n\"I shouldn't have and I'm sorry that I did,\" he said. \"I was presented with an opportunity to help police and I blew it.\"\n\nMORE: Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes sentenced to 18 years for leading Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy\n\n\"I did not want to advance into the building, and I left James in there as soon as I could get out,\" he added.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta said he found no evidence that Minuta entered the building to help police.\n\n\"You and I will have to agree to disagree about that,\" Mehta said.\n\nMehta also found no evidence that Minuta himself brought a weapon into the district or served as a critical leader of the group. However, Mehta did apply a terrorism enhancement to the sentence that was ultimately handed down.\n\nVallejo himself wasn't accused of taking any violent actions on Jan. 6, but prosecutors argued his position as a leader of the \"quick reaction force\" was even more serious. Oath Keepers amassed a cache of weapons at a Virginia hotel where Vallejo awaited orders from those in Washington, D.C., prosecutors alleged.\n\nDefense attorney Matthew Peed argued that Vallejo was influenced by Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and then-President Donald Trump to think what he was doing was patriotic. As an example of his respect for the democratic process, Peed said Vallejo had been a major supporter of former Rep. Ron Paul, even attending a national political convention on his behalf.\n\nMORE: Former Oath Keeper sentenced for role in Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\n\"He just thought that something different (on Jan. 6) was happening because the President had told him,\" Peed said.\n\nVallejo was also sentenced to three years of supervised release following his prison term, including time on home confinement.\n\n\"He has had an impeccable pre-trial record,\" Mehta said, before allowing Vallejo to walk out of court and self-surrender.\n\nLast week, Rhodes received the longest sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant to date at 18 years, a decision that was also handed down by Mehta.\n\nMore Oath Keeper defendants sentenced for Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"

      "text": "Proud Boys' Enrique Tarrio gets record 22 years in prison for Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced Tuesday to 22 years in prison for orchestrating a failed plot to keep Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 election , capping the case with the stiffest punishment that has been handed down yet for the U.S. Capitol attack.\n\nTarrio, 39, pleaded for leniency before the judge imposed the prison term topping the 18-year sentences given to Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and one-time Proud Boys leader Ethan Nordean for seditious conspiracy and other convictions stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\n\nTarrio, who led the neofacist group as it became a force in mainstream Republican circles, lowered his head after the sentence was imposed, then squared his shoulders. He raised his hand and made a \"V\" gesture with his fingers as he was led out of the courtroom in orange jail garb.\n\nHis sentencing comes as the Justice Department prepares to put Trump on trial at the same courthouse in Washington on charges that the then-president illegally schemed to cling to power that he knew had been stripped away by voters.\n\nRising to speak before the sentence was handed down, Tarrio called Jan. 6 a \"national embarrassment,\" and apologized to the police officers who defended the Capitol and the lawmakers who fled in fear. His voice cracked as he said he let down his family and vowed that he is done with politics.\n\n\"I am not a political zealot. Inflicting harm or changing the results of the election was not my goal,\" Tarrio said. \"Please show me mercy,\" he said, adding, \"I ask you that you not take my 40s from me.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, said Tarrio was motivated by \"revolutionary zeal\" to lead the conspiracy that resulted in \"200 men, amped up for battle, encircling the Capitol.\" Noting that Tarrio had not previously shown any remorse publicly for his crimes, the judge said a stiff punishment was necessary to deter future political violence.\n\n\"It can't happen again. It can't happen again,\" the judge repeated.\n\nTarrio and three lieutenants were convicted in May of seditious conspiracy and other crimes after a months-long trial that served as a vivid reminder of the violent chaos fueled by Trump's lies about the election that helped inspire right-wing extremists like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\n\nProsecutors had sought 33 years behind bars for Tarrio, describing him as the ringleader of a plot to use violence to shatter the cornerstone of American democracy and overturn the election victory by Joe Biden, a Democrat, over Trump, the Republican incumbent.\n\nProsecutor Conor Mulroe told the judge that the Proud Boys came dangerously close to succeeding in their plot - and noted that \"it didn't take rifles or explosives.\"\n\n\"There was a very real possibility we were going to wake up on Jan. 7 in a full-blown constitutional crisis,\" Mulroe said, with \"300 million Americans having no idea who the next president would be or how it would be decided.\"\n\nTarrio wasn't in Washington, D.C, when Proud Boys members joined thousands of Trump supporters , who smashed windows, beat police officers and poured into the House and Senate chambers as lawmakers met to certify Biden's victory. But prosecutors say the Miami resident organized and led the Proud Boys' assault from afar, inspiring followers with his charisma and penchant for propaganda.\n\nTarrio's lawyers denied the Proud Boys had any plan to attack the Capitol or stop the certification of Biden's victory. They argued that prosecutors used Tarrio as a scapegoat for Trump, who spoke at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally near the White House on Jan. 6 and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\nTarrio's younger sister, fiancé and mother tearfully urged the judge to show mercy before the sentence was imposed. Tarrio took off his glasses and wiped his eyes as he listened to his mother speak.\n\nThe defense asked for no more than 15 years in prison, arguing that their client should not be punished as harshly as the Oath Keepers' Rhodes, who was present on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6.\n\nDefense attorney Nayib Hassan told reporters after the hearing that they will appeal.\n\nTarrio's lawyers described him as a \"keyboard ninja,\" who was prone to \"talk trash,\" but had no intentions of overthrowing the government. The Proud Boys' only plans that day were to protest the election and confront left-wing antifa activists, attorney Sabino Jauregui told the judge.\n\n\"My client is no terrorist,\" Jauregui said. \"My client is a misguided patriot.\"\n\nTarrio had been arrested two days before the Capitol riot on charges that he defaced a Black Lives Matter banner during an earlier rally in the nation's capital, and he had complied with a judge's order to leave the city after his arrest.\n\nThe judge agreed with prosecutors that the Proud Boys' crimes could be punished as \"terrorism\" - increasing the recommended sentence under federal guidelines. But he ultimately sentenced the Proud Boys to shorter prison terms than those sought by prosecutors.\n\nThe backbone of the government's case was hundreds of messages exchanged by Proud Boys in the days leading up to Jan. 6 that prosecutors say showed how the extremists saw themselves as revolutionaries and celebrated the Capitol attack, which sent lawmakers running into hiding .\n\nThe judge pointed to Tarrio's messages cheering on the Capitol attack and the Proud Boys' role in it.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" Tarrio wrote in one message. \"We did this.\" In another post as the Proud Boys swarmed the Capitol, Tarrio commanded: \"Do what must be done.\" In a Proud Boys encrypted group chat later that day someone asked what they should do next. Tarrio responded, \"Do it again.\"\n\nHe is the final Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy to receive his punishment. Three fellow Proud Boys found guilty by a Washington jury of the rarely used sedition charge were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 18 years.\n\nThe Justice Department is appealing the 18-year prison sentence of Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy in a separate case, as well as the sentences of other members of his antigovernment militia group that were lighter than what prosecutors had sought. Prosecutors had requested 25 years in prison for Rhodes.\n\n___\n\nRicher reported from Boston."

That decision could foreshadow lengthy sentences down the road for other far-right extremists, including former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who have also been convicted of the rarely used charge.\n\nBefore announcing Mr. Rhodes' sentence, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta described a defiant Mr. Rhodes as a continued threat to the United States and democracy. The judge expressed fear that what happened on Jan. 6 could be repeated, saying Americans will \"now hold our collective breaths every time an election is approaching.\"\n\n\"You are smart, you are charismatic and compelling and frankly that's what makes you dangerous,\" the judge told Mr. Rhodes. \"The moment you are released, whenever that may be, you will be ready to take up arms against your government.\"\n\nMr. Rhodes did not use his chance to address the judge to express remorse or appeal for leniency, but instead claimed to be a \"political prisoner,\" criticized prosecutors and the Mr. Biden administration, and tried to play down his actions on Jan. 6.\n\n\"I'm a political prisoner and like President Trump my only crime is opposing those who are destroying our country,\" said Mr. Rhodes, who appeared in Washington's federal court wearing orange jail clothes.\n\nMr. Mehta fired back that Mr. Rhodes was not prosecuted for his political beliefs but for actions that the judge described as an \"offense against the people of the country.\"\n\n\"You are not a political prisoner, Mr. Rhodes,\" the judge said.\n\nAnother Oath Keeper convicted of seditious conspiracy alongside Mr. Rhodes - Florida chapter leader Kelly Meggs - was sentenced later Thursday to 12 years behind bars.\n\nMr. Meggs said he was sorry he was involved in the riot that left a \"black eye on the country,\" but maintained that he never planned to go into the Capitol.\n\nThe judge found Mr. Meggs doesn't present an ongoing threat to the country the way Mr. Rhodes does, but told him \"violence cannot be resorted to just because you disagree with who got elected.\"\n\nOther Oath Keepers are expected to be sentenced Friday and next week.\n\nA Washington, D.C., jury found Mr. Rhodes guilty of leading a plot to forcibly disrupt the transfer of presidential power. Prosecutors alleged Mr. Rhodes and his followers recruited members, amassed weapons, and set up \"quick reaction force\" teams at a Virginia hotel that could ferry guns into the nation's capital if they were needed to support their plot. The weapons were never deployed.\n\nIt was one of the most consequential Capitol riot cases brought by the government, which has sought to prove that the attack by right-wing extremists such as the Oath Keepers was not a spontaneous protest but the culmination of weeks of plotting to overturn Mr. Biden's victory.\n\nMr. Rhodes' January 2022 arrest was the culmination of a decades-long path of extremism that included armed standoffs with federal authorities at Nevada's Bundy Ranch. After founding the Oath Keepers in 2009, the Yale Law School graduate built it into one of the largest far-right antigovernment militia groups in the U.S., though it appears to have weakened in the wake of the Oath Keepers' arrests.\n\nThe judge agreed to prosecutors' request for a so-called \"terrorism enhancement\" - which can lead to a longer prison term - under the argument that the Oath Keepers sought to influence the government through \"intimidation or coercion.\" Judges in less serious Jan. 6 cases had previously rejected such requests.\n\nProsecutors had sought 25 years for Mr. Rhodes, arguing that a lengthy sentence was necessary to deter future political violence.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy pointed to interviews and speeches Mr. Rhodes has given from jail repeating the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and saying it would be again in 2024. In remarks just days ago, Mr. Rhodes called for \"regime change,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nMr. Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, plans to appeal his conviction.\n\nDefense lawyer Phillip Linder told the judge that prosecutors were unfairly trying to make Mr. Rhodes \"the face\" of Jan. 6, adding that Mr. Rhodes could have had many more Oath Keepers come to the Capitol \"if he really wanted to\" disrupt Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote.\n\n\"If you want to put a face on J6 [Jan. 6], you put it on Trump, right-wing media, politicians, all the people who spun that narrative,\" Mr. Linder said.\n\nMr. Rhodes' sentence may signal the punishment prosecutors will seek for Mr. Tarrio and other Proud Boys leaders convicted of seditious conspiracy. They will be sentenced in August and September.\n\nThe Oath Keepers said there was never any plan to attack the Capitol or stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory. The defense tried to seize on the fact that none of the Oath Keepers' messages laid out an explicit plan to storm the Capitol. But prosecutors said the Oath Keepers saw an opportunity to further their goal to stop the transfer of power and sprang into action when the mob began storming the building.\n\nMessages, recordings, and other evidence presented at trial show Mr. Rhodes and his followers growing increasingly enraged after the 2020 election at the prospect of a Biden presidency, which they viewed as a threat to the country and their way of life. In an encrypted chat two days after the election, Mr. Rhodes told his followers to prepare their \"mind, body, spirit\" for \"civil war.\"\n\nBefore Thursday, the longest sentence in the more than 1,000 Capitol riot cases was 14 years for a man with a long criminal record who attacked police officers with pepper spray and a chair as he stormed the Capitol.

Federal law enforcement has warned of potential violent demonstrations at every state capitol ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next week.\n\nThe immediate political consequences could soon be resolved - though the aftershocks will linger. The House of Representatives this week, in a bipartisan vote, impeached President Donald Trump for a historic second time for \"incitement of insurrection.\" Next comes a trial in the Senate.\n\nThe legal fallout from the Jan. 6 Capitol invasion is likely to reach hundreds of cases. It could also affect the free speech rights of Americans and shatter one last political norm.\n\nThe legal consequences, however, may not be known for months.\n\nCriminal investigations into the Capitol invasion are underway both federally and locally, and the significance of these investigations should not be underestimated, says Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney who teaches at the University of Alabama School of Law.\n\n\"The work that's ahead of the Justice Department in determining if it's something that just sort of organically erupted, or ... if there was a conspiracy that wanted to overthrow a legitimately elected government,\" she adds, \"has to rank up there as the most significant investigation the Justice Department has taken on.\"\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives this week, in a bipartisan vote, impeached President Donald Trump for a historic second time for \"incitement of insurrection.\" Next comes a trial in the U.S. Senate.\n\nWith regard to Jan. 6 itself, the answer is still maybe. The president obviously wasn't part of the mob that broke into and ransacked the Capitol, but his speech at a rally hours before the riot - and possibly his actions, or lack of action, during it - could potentially be prosecuted.\n\nThe First Amendment protects many kinds of speech, but not all kinds of speech. For prosecutors to prove that the president incited the mob to invade the Capitol they would have to prove - beyond a reasonable doubt - that he was both trying to encourage immediate lawbreaking and that his words were likely to produce that lawbreaking. (The relevant Supreme Court precedent, for those curious, is Brandenburg v. Ohio .)\n\nThat's a very high burden, which is why many legal experts are skeptical that we could see Mr. Trump prosecuted for inciting the Capitol invasion. That case could also have such a sizable effect on the free speech rights of Americans generally that prosecutors may be wary of touching it.\n\nCriminally, regarding Jan. 6 specifically, he probably is. (Two caveats: Impeachment is a political process, and a Senate trial operates differently from a criminal trial. Also, the DOJ is investigating the extent to which the Capitol invasion was planned in advance. If they can prove that it was, and if they can prove that the president was somehow personally involved, all bets are off.)\n\nWhat Mr. Trump should be more worried about, legal experts say, is criminal exposure on other fronts. He is already fighting investigations by prosecutors in New York into his personal finances, as well as multiple defamation lawsuits from women who have accused him of sexual assault.\n\nThen there are more recent actions. Legal experts point to his Jan. 2 phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, asking the state official to \"find\" votes that would flip the presidential election result in the state in his favor, as a potential violation of state and federal election law.\n\n\"It's a better case for him to be charged with attempting to engage in election fraud,\" says Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School. \"By all means I say go after Trump, but go after him in ways that don't risk harming the civil liberties of ordinary people.\"\n\nIt's not just rare, it's never happened.\n\nThis isn't because former presidents have some form of special protection. But since the country was founded, Americans have been wary of criminalizing politics, and presidents have been wary of criminalizing their predecessors.\n\nGiven his potential legal exposure, this could be another norm the Trump presidency breaks. It will represent a challenge for President-elect Biden. He has pledged to restore the independence of the DOJ - an agency that lies within the executive branch but that is designed to represent the American people as a whole - after problematic behavior during the Trump administration. His administration prosecuting his predecessor would, at the very least, look bad.\n\nBut the Justice Department's prosecutorial decision-making \"has to be independent,\" says Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and senior FBI official.\n\n\"How hard is that to become independent? It's not that hard. The president just has to stay the [heck] out of it,\" he adds.\n\nShort answer: lots. Longer answer: With charges still coming in, the specifics are unclear.\n\nThere have been 275 federal and local cases filed in connection to the Capitol invasion, Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., said at a press conference Friday. Mr. Sherwin added that he expects the number to grow.\n\nMost of the charges filed so far have been relatively minor, such as engaging in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, unlawful entry, and violating curfew under the district's criminal code. But those are just initial charges. As law enforcement gathers and reviews more evidence, more indictments and charges will be filed. Existing charges could also be upgraded or downgraded.\n\nTreason (defined in the Constitution as \"levying war\" against the United States or giving \"aid and comfort\" to its enemies) and insurrection (essentially defined as engaging in a rebellion against the government) are both rarely charged in general and unlikely to be charged here.\n\nBut Mr. Sherwin did confirm this week that a \"strike force\" of senior prosecutors is building seditious conspiracy charges. A crime with a long and controversial history of criminalizing political dissent, \"seditious conspiracy\" is defined as conspiring to \"levy war\" against the U.S. government, or attempting to \"hinder or delay the execution\" of U.S. law, or trying to \"seize, take, or possess\" government property.\n\n\"It's a very serious charge, and one we don't see often,\" says Kami Chavis, a former assistant U.S. attorney who directs the Criminal Justice Program at Wake Forest University. \"We'll have to wait for the evidence investigators uncover to prove that against certain individuals.\"\n\nThis is likely to be a sprawling and complex investigation. Every FBI field office is working on it. And experts say a big challenge for law enforcement will be simply identifying everyone who was involved.\n\nAgents will be studying video footage, following up on tips, looking at social media postings and relationship charts, and interviewing witnesses and suspects. It will be like investigating the mafia, says David Gomez, a former assistant special agent-in-charge in the FBI's Seattle field office.\n\n\"If you believe you have a criminal enterprise conspiracy you work your way up from the bottom and find out who leaders are,\" he adds.\n\nWhen the time comes to go to court - and the pandemic has disrupted jury trials across the country - they will mostly be tried in federal and local court in Washington. Expect a lot of plea bargains, though.\n\nIt's also important to note that the FBI isn't obliged, nor likely, to share every detail of these investigations - particularly bigger and more sensitive aspects like whether the Capitol riot was planned.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The verdict marks a significant milestone for the Justice Department in its Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nLoading...\n\nNov. 30, 2022, 11:01 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nOath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes was convicted Tuesday of seditious conspiracy for a violent plot to overturn President Joe Biden's election, handing the Justice Department a major victory in its massive prosecution of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nA Washington, D.C., jury found Mr. Rhodes guilty of sedition after three days of deliberations in the nearly two-month-long trial that showcased the far-right extremist group's efforts to keep Republican Donald Trump in the White House at all costs.\n\nMr. Rhodes was acquitted of two other conspiracy charges. A co-defendant - Kelly Meggs, who led the antigovernment group's Florida chapter - was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, while three other associates were cleared of that charge. Jurors found all five defendants guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding: Congress' certification of Mr. Biden's electoral victory.\n\nThe verdict, while mixed, marks a significant milestone for the Justice Department and is likely to clear the path for prosecutors to move ahead at full steam in upcoming trials of other extremists accused of sedition.\n\nMr. Rhodes and Ms. Meggs are the first people in nearly three decades to be found guilty at trial of seditious conspiracy - a rarely used Civil War-era charge that can be difficult to prove. The offense calls for up to 20 years behind bars.\n\nIt could embolden investigators, whose work has expanded beyond those who attacked the Capitol to focus on others linked to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland recently named a veteran prosecutor, Jack Smith, to serve as special counsel to oversee key aspects of a probe into efforts to subvert the election as well as a separate investigation into the retention of classified documents at Mr. Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMr. Garland said after the verdict that the Justice Department \"is committed to holding accountable those criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"Democracy depends on the peaceful transfer of power. By attempting to block the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, the defendants flouted and trampled the rule of law,\" Steven M. D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington Field Office, said in an emailed statement. \"This case shows that force and violence are no match for our country's justice system.\"\n\nUsing dozens of encrypted messages, recordings, and surveillance video, prosecutors made the case that Mr. Rhodes began shortly after the 2020 election to prepare an armed rebellion to stop the transfer of presidential power.\n\nOver seven weeks of testimony, jurors heard how Mr. Rhodes rallied his followers to fight to defend Mr. Trump, discussed the prospect of a \"bloody\" civil war and warned the Oath Keepers may have to \"rise up in insurrection\" to defeat Mr. Biden if Mr. Trump didn't act.\n\nDefense attorneys accused prosecutors of twisting their clients' words and insisted the Oath Keepers came to Washington only to provide security for figures such as Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally. The defense focused heavily on seeking to show that Mr. Rhodes' rhetoric was just bluster and that the Oath Keepers had no plan before Jan. 6 to attack the Capitol.\n\nMr. Rhodes intends to appeal, defense attorney James Lee Bright told reporters. Another Rhodes lawyer, Ed Tarpley, described the verdict as a \"mixed bag,\" adding, \"This is not a total victory for the government in any way, shape, or form.\"\n\n\"We feel like we presented a case that showed through evidence and testimony that Rhodes did not commit the crime of seditious conspiracy,\" Mr. Tarpley said.\n\nOn trial alongside Mr. Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, and Ms. Meggs were Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy intelligence officer from Virginia; and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group.\n\nMr. Caldwell was convicted on two counts and acquitted on three others, including seditious conspiracy. His attorney, David Fischer, called the verdict \"major victory\" for his client and a \"major defeat\" for the Justice Department. He also said he would appeal the two convictions.\n\nJury selection for a second group of Oath Keepers facing seditious conspiracy charges is scheduled to begin next week. Several members of the Proud Boys, including the former national chairman Enrique Tarrio, are also scheduled to go to trial on the sedition charge in December.\n\nIn an extraordinary move, Mr. Rhodes took the stand to tell jurors there was no plan to attack the Capitol and insisted that his followers who went inside the building went rogue.\n\nMr. Rhodes testified that he had no idea that his followers were going to join the mob and storm the Capitol and said he was upset after he found out that some did. Mr. Rhodes said they were acting \"stupid\" and outside their mission for the day.\n\nProsecutors said the Oath Keepers saw an opportunity to advance their plot to stop the transfer of power and sprang into action when the mob started storming the Capitol. The Capitol attack was a \"means to an end\" for the Oath Keepers, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy told jurors in her closing argument.\n\nJurors heard how Mr. Rhodes spent thousands of dollars on an AR-platform rifle, magazines, mounts, sights, and other equipment on his way to Washington ahead of the riot. They watched surveillance footage from the Virginia hotel where some Oath Keepers stashed weapons for \"quick reaction force\" teams prosecutors said were ready to get weapons into the city quickly if they were needed. The weapons were never deployed.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Oath Keepers wearing combat gear were seen on camera shouldering their way through the crowd and into the Capitol. Mr. Rhodes remained outside like a \"general surveying his troops on the battlefield,\" a prosecutor said. After the riot, Mr. Rhodes and other Oath Keepers went to an Olive Garden restaurant to celebrate, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe trial revealed new details about Mr. Rhodes' efforts to pressure Mr. Trump to fight to stay in White House in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. Shortly after the election, in a group chat that included Mr. Stone called \"FOS\" or \"Friends of Stone,\" Mr. Rhodes wrote, \"So will you step up and push Trump to FINALLY take decisive action?\"\n\nAnother man testified that after the riot, Mr. Rhodes tried to persuade him to pass along a message to Mr. Trump that urged the president not to give up his fight to hold onto power. The intermediary - a man who told jurors he had an indirect way to reach the president - recorded his meeting with Mr. Rhodes and went to the FBI instead of giving the message to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"If he's not going to do the right thing and he's just gonna let himself be removed illegally then we should have brought rifles,\" Mr. Rhodes said during that meeting, according to a recording played for jurors. \"We should have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang [expletive] Pelosi from the lamppost,\" Mr. Rhodes said, referring to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThree other Oath Keepers previously pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy. The last time the Justice Department had secured such a conviction at trial, though, was in the 1995 prosecution of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb New York City landmarks.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

Four other members of the group have also been convicted.\n\nLoading...\n\nMay 04, 2023, 12:24 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nFormer Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was convicted on Thursday of orchestrating a plot for members of his far-right extremist group to attack the U.S. Capitol in a desperate bid to keep Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA jury in Washington, D.C., found Mr. Tarrio guilty of seditious conspiracy after hearing from dozens of witnesses over more than three months in one of the most serious cases brought in the stunning attack that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021, as the world watched on live TV.\n\nIt's a significant milestone for the Justice Department, which has now secured seditious conspiracy convictions against the leaders of two major extremist groups prosecutors say were intent on keeping Democrat Joe Biden out of the White House at all costs. The charge carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years.\n\nMr. Tarrio was a top target of what has become the largest Justice Department investigation in American history. He led the neo-fascist group - known for street fights with left-wing activists - when Mr. Trump infamously told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" during his first debate with Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Tarrio wasn't in Washington on Jan. 6, because he had been arrested two days earlier in a separate case and ordered out of the capital city. But prosecutors said he organized and directed the attack by Proud Boys who stormed the Capitol that day.\n\nProsecutors told jurors the group viewed itself as \"Trump's army\" and was prepared for \"all-out war\" to stop Mr. Biden from becoming president.\n\nThe Proud Boys were \"lined up behind Donald Trump and willing to commit violence on his behalf,\" prosecutor Conor Mulroe said in his closing argument.\n\nThe backbone of the government's case was hundreds of messages exchanged by Proud Boys in the days leading up to Jan. 6 that show the far-right extremist group peddling Mr. Trump's false claims of a stolen election and trading fears over what would happen when Biden took office.\n\nAs Proud Boys swarmed the Capitol, Mr. Tarrio cheered them on from afar, writing on social media: \"Do what must be done.\" In a Proud Boys encrypted group chat later that day someone asked what they should do next. Mr. Tarrio responded: \"Do it again.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" Mr. Tarrio wrote in another message. \"We did this.\"\n\nDefense lawyers denied there was any plot to attack the Capitol or stop Congress' certification of Mr. Biden's win. A lawyer for Mr. Tarrio sought to push the blame onto Mr. Trump, arguing the former president incited the pro-Trump mob's attack when he urged the crowd near the White House to \"fight like hell.\"\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's words. It was his motivation. It was his anger that caused what occurred on January 6th in your beautiful and amazing city,\" attorney Nayib Hassan said in his final appeal to jurors. \"It was not Enrique Tarrio. They want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and those in power.\"\n\nMr. Tarrio, a Miami resident, was charged and tried with four other Proud Boys: Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola. Mr. Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter leader. Mr. Rehl led a group chapter in Philadelphia. Mr. Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, was a self-described Proud Boys organizer. Mr. Pezzola was a group member from Rochester, New York.\n\nThe Justice Department hadn't tried a seditious conspiracy case in a decade before a jury convicted another extremist group leader, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, of the Civil War-era charge last year.\n\nOver the course of two Oath Keepers trials, Mr. Rhodes and five other members were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said was a separate plot to forcibly halt the transfer of presidential power from Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden. Three defendants were acquitted of the sedition charge, but convicted of obstructing Congress' certification of Mr. Biden's electoral victory.\n\nThe Justice Department has yet to disclose how much prison time it will seek when the Oath Keepers are sentenced next month.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The group celebrated the Capitol attack as a victory in that fight and continued their plot even after Mr. Biden's electoral victory was certified, Mr. Nestler alleged.\n\n\"Their goal was to stop, by whatever means necessary, the lawful transfer of presidential power, including by taking up arms against the United States government,\" the prosecutor said during his opening statement. \"They concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy.\"\n\nThe defendants are the first among hundreds of people arrested in the Capitol riot to stand trial on seditious conspiracy, a rare Civil War-era charge that calls for up to 20 years behind bars. The stakes are high for the Justice Department, which last secured such a conviction at trial nearly 30 years ago, and intends to try two more groups on the charge later this year.\n\nThe trial comes as Mr. Trump continues to insist, against much evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and as vocal pushback against the charges filed against those who entered the Capitol continues in some quarters. The broader reaction could show how the American public, as well as the jury, sees the attack, nearly two years later.\n\nDefense attorneys accused prosecutors of cherry-picking comments from messages and videos and said the government has no evidence there ever was any plan to attack the Capitol. Mr. Rhodes' attorney said his client will take the stand and show that the Oath Keepers had merely been preparing for orders they expected from Mr. Trump but never came.\n\n\"Stewart Rhodes meant no harm to the Capitol that day. Stewart Rhodes did not have any violent intent that day,\" Mr. Rhodes' attorney, Phillip Linder, said. \"The story the government is trying to tell you today is completely wrong.\"\n\nOn trial with Mr. Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia, and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. They face several other charges as well.\n\nThey are among roughly 900 people who have been charged in the attack, which temporarily halted the certification of Mr. Biden's victory, sent lawmakers running for cover, and left dozens of police officers injured.\n\nIn the Oath Keepers case, prosecutors will try to prove that their actions were not a spontaneous outpouring of election-fueled rage but part of a detailed, drawn-out plot to stop Mr. Biden from entering the White House.\n\nThe Oath Keepers \"were prepared in November, they were prepared in December and when the opportunity finally presented itself on Jan 6, 2021, they sprang into action,\" Mr. Nestler said.\n\nMr. Rhodes began plotting to overturn Mr. Biden's victory right after the election, Mr. Nestler said. In November 2020, Mr. Rhodes sent his followers a step-by-step plan for stopping the transfer of power based on a popular uprising that brought down Yugoslavia's president two decades earlier.\n\nAround the same time, Mr. Rhodes was also communicating in another internet group - which included Trump ally Roger Stone - that was called \"FOS,\" or \"Friends of Stone,\" according to testimony. On Nov. 7, 2020, Mr. Rhodes said in a message to that group that he was on his way to D.C. for a possible \"op\" and was available to meet \"face-to-face.\"\n\nAs December approached, Mr. Rhodes' rhetoric became increasingly violent and desperate, Mr. Nestler said.\n\nIn messages and comments read to the jury, the Oath Keepers repeatedly warned of violence if Mr. Biden were to become president. During a December interview, Mr. Rhodes called senators \"traitors\" and warned that the Oath Keepers would have to \"overthrow, abort, or abolish Congress.\" He described Jan. 6 as a \"hard constitutional deadline\" for stopping the transfer of power.\n\nThe Oath Keepers organized training, including one session on \"unconventional warfare.\" Before coming to Washington, they stashed \"weapons of war\" at a Virginia hotel to serve as \"quick reaction force\" that could get guns into the capital quickly if necessary, the prosecutor said.\n\nAs Oath Keepers stormed the Capitol in helmets and other battle gear, Mr. Rhodes remained on the outside, like \"a general surveying his troops on a battlefield,\" Mr. Nestler said. After the attack, the elated Oath Keepers went to a Virginia restaurant to celebrate their victory, the prosecutor said.\n\nIn the days between the riot and Mr. Biden's inauguration, Mr. Rhodes spent more than $17,000 on firearm parts, ammunition, and other items, prosecutors say. Shortly after the insurrection, Mr. Rhodes was secretly recorded saying that his \"only regret is that they should have brought rifles,\" Mr. Nestler said.\n\nAmong those who may testify during the trial, which will last several weeks, are three Oath Keepers who've pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and are cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of getting lighter sentences. They include a man who says that after arriving in Washington, Mr. Meggs told him that another Florida Oath Keeper had brought explosives in his RV.\n\nThe government's first witness was an FBI agent, who responded on Jan. 6 to help rescue senators. He described lawmakers crying, broken doors and windows, and a scene that \"looked like a bomb had gone off.\"\n\nDefense lawyers say prosecutors have ripped the Oath Keepers' messages out of context to paint them unfairly. The Oath Keepers came to Washington to provide security at events for figures such as Mr. Stone before the president's big outdoor rally behind the White House, defense lawyers said. Mr. Rhodes' attorney described the group as a \"peacekeeping\" force and called his client an \"extremely patriotic\" man who \"loves this country.\"\n\nMr. Rhodes' attorneys plan to argue that Mr. Rhodes believed Mr. Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act and call up a militia, which Mr. Rhodes had been calling on him to do to stop Mr. Biden from becoming president. Mr. Rhodes' lawyers have said he was merely lobbying the president to invoke a U.S. law.\n\nProsecutors say it's clear the Oath Keepers were going to act regardless of what Mr. Trump did. Mr. Nestler told jurors that Mr. Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, was only using the Insurrection Act as \"legal cover.\" In one message, Mr. Rhodes wrote in December 2020 that Mr. Trump \"needs to know that if he fails to act, then we will.\"\n\nAn attorney for Mr. Caldwell said his client is a disabled veteran who didn't even know of the Oath Keepers until November 2020. The defense lawyer, David Fischer, called Jan. 6 a \"black eye\" for the country, but said Mr. Caldwell merely came to Washington \"on a date with his wife\" and wasn't even planning to go to the Capitol until Mr. Trump's speech on the Ellipse before the riot.\n\n\"Mr. Caldwell couldn't storm his way out of a paper bag,\" Mr. Fischer said. \"I came here to clear his name.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The investigation appears to include a probe of Mr. Trump's personal role, though he is likely not a target per se.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that Attorney General Merrick Garland has already decided whether to include the former president in any prosecution, say former prosecutors. He would want first to let his department's gathering of evidence run its course.\n\nThe decision whether to prosecute a former president comes fraught with risk. Not prosecuting could signal that a president is indeed above the law. But a case could feed distrust and establish a dangerous precedent.\n\nBut bits that have emerged - plus testimony from the congressional Jan. 6 committee - show that it is indeed possible Mr. Trump could be indicted for some of his actions, say experts. For Attorney General Garland, the choice may turn on a more difficult and politically fraught question: Would such a prosecution be good for the country?\n\nOn the one hand, not prosecuting could send the message that for practical purposes a president is indeed above the law. It might invite worse from future chief executives.\n\nOn the other, such a case could infuriate Trump supporters, feed distrust of U.S. political institutions, and establish a dangerous precedent.\n\nIt's almost a no-win choice - and perhaps indicative of forces that have been eroding American democracy for years, says Rebecca Roiphe, a former Manhattan prosecutor and professor at New York Law School.\n\n\"A healthy democracy does not face this situation, where one administration has to seriously consider a prosecution against the head of the previous administration,\" says Professor Roiphe. \"I certainly don't envy Merrick Garland.\"\n\nThe combination of Jan. 6 panel testimony and recent legal maneuvering by prosecutors at both federal and state levels has hinted at former President Trump's legal exposure for his efforts to hold onto office, and gripped Washington over the past month.\n\nNumerous witnesses for the Jan. 6 committee said that following the November election, the former president was told many times by different advisers that he had lost, that claims of widespread voting fraud were false, and efforts to interfere with counting of Electoral College votes were illegal and could result in federal charges.\n\nSome legal experts say this testimony could be used to establish that the former president knew what he was doing was wrong - a requisite for prosecution. Others believe proving such intent remains a key problem facing any federal case. Mr. Trump himself has continued to insist publicly that the election was stolen and he is the one who is on the right side of the law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice has executed several search warrants for the electronic communications of lawyer John Eastman, who helped the Trump team develop alternate slates of fake \"electors\" that might help GOP state legislators overturn the 2020 results. Federal authorities in June searched the home of Jeffery Clark, a former Justice official who wanted to send letters to Georgia and other states claiming, falsely, that the department had evidence of widespread fraud in those states.\n\nThe DOJ has sent subpoenas to many of the people who signed their names on false \"elector\" slates. Two top aides to Vice President Mike Pence have testified before a federal grand jury about the pressure put on Mr. Pence to block the counting of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.\n\nFrom all this, it is fair to conclude that Mr. Trump's closest advisers are being investigated for fraud, says Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney who is now a law professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\n\"The most likely crimes remain conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding by interfering with the January 6 vote certification, and conspiracy to defraud the United States by attempting to interfere with the lawful transfer of presidential power based on the lie that the election was stolen,\" writes Professor McQuade in an email.\n\nAnother charge federal prosecutors might be looking at is seditious conspiracy, says Professor McQuade. That would require proof that a person entered into an agreement with someone else to interfere with the lawful transfer of presidential power. Some members of the extremist Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups are already facing seditious conspiracy charges for their actions dealing with Jan. 6.\n\n\"Several members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. [DOJ] also has the phones of the group's leaders,\" she says.\n\nThe former U.S. attorney believes that another charge federal authorities could make is involuntary manslaughter, to account for the people who died during the Jan. 6 fighting at the Capitol. Involuntary manslaughter requires only that a person caused the death of another by failing to exercise \"due care.\" It doesn't require intent - only gross negligence.\n\nBut Washington is not the only source of legal troubles for Donald Trump. In Georgia, Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis is forging ahead with a wide-ranging investigation of Trump administration efforts to overturn the 2020 vote in her state. (Fulton County is the most populous county in Georgia and includes Atlanta, the state capital.)\n\nIt's possible the Georgia case will come to fruition before its federal counterpart. Ms. Willis has been moving aggressively. She has experience using Georgia's relatively expansive RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) statute in complex cases. Her evidence includes a taped phone call between Mr. Trump and Georgia's chief election official in which the former asked the latter to \"find\" an additional 11,870 votes in his favor, an increase that would have flipped the state electoral result.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp has already testified. Ms. Willis has subpoenaed some of Mr. Trump's closest allies, including Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nHer efforts dialed up this summer as she convened a special grand jury and, just in the last month, issued target letters informing recipients of possible charges to a wide range of people who may have been cogs in a wider conspiracy. They include everyone from the state GOP chair to a local car salesman - people who participated in the formation of Georgia's alternate slate of fake presidential \"electors.\"\n\nMs. Willis is \"casting a wider net,\" says Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta.\n\nBut there may be risks to such an approach. One judge has already reprimanded Ms. Willis for attending a Democratic fundraiser for a race involving one of the recipients of her target letters.\n\nProfessor Kreis says that as a general matter he is concerned about over-prosecution and stretching past the limits of the law.\n\nBut more often than not in U.S. history, those who try to usurp elections have gotten away with it - particularly post-Reconstruction era Southern elections. Given that context, a Georgia case over the 2020 election might be fitting, he says.\n\n\"If this is the case that the buck stops in Fulton County, there's something that's historical about that in a good way, in the sense that there will be justice for trying to undo a legitimate election,\" says Professor Kreis.\n\nBut the most important decision regarding any prosecution of former President Trump or his associates remains with Attorney General Garland.\n\nThe choice to proceed or not with a federal case that could conceivably jail a former occupant of the Oval Office would be a profound one. No former president has ever been charged with a crime.\n\nOn one side are legal experts who think the former president's actions don't meet the standards of an actionable offense under the relevant statutes. Others warn of the cost of failure - a \"not guilty\" verdict could embolden future presidents to go beyond Mr. Trump's attempts to remain in power. Still others say the political divisions a prosecution would produce could make the nation's current polarization much worse.\n\nThose on the other side say that not prosecuting Mr. Trump's actions would also embolden further such lawbreaking . And non-prosecution, some say, could also widen division. It can be \"divisive and destructive of civic peace ... to see criminal behavior prosper,\" tweeted Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson .\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Whatever the attorney general decides, a large portion of American voters will be outraged. A long decline of faith in the nation's political, judicial, and civic structures has been exacerbated by the norm-breaking, confrontation, and strains of the Trump era.\n\n\"I'm not worried about another Jan. 6,\" she says. \"I am worried that we may no longer have enough faith in these institutions to decide matters in a way everybody can say was fair.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He had telegraphed his intent to issue Jan. 6 pardons, but the immediate and near-total reprieve - just 14 defendants had serious sentences commuted rather than pardoned - surprised many Americans.\n\nIn the wake of President Trump's pardons for the Jan. 6 rioters, police question the long-term effect on police and public safety.\n\n\"Many officers are disappointed,'' says Mr. Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association.\n\nThe National Association of Police Organizations - of which the WPPA is a member - firmly opposed the pardons Tuesday. Likewise, the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police jointly voiced concerns that when those who commit crimes - particularly violent acts that target police - don't face consequences, \"it sends a dangerous message that could embolden others.\"\n\nThe unions also criticized former President Joe Biden, who, before leaving office this month, commuted the sentence of someone convicted of killing law enforcement officers. However, their joint statement followed President Trump's Inauguration Day action.\n\nGiven this pushback, President Trump's pardons, particularly for those convicted of attacking police, could be a political miscalculation.\n\nFor many Americans - most of whom oppose pardons for Jan. 6 rioters - it corrodes the notion that violence against officers is an attack on America's tradition of, and appreciation for, law and order.\n\n\"When police officers are killed or injured, it's almost comparable to a political assassination,\" says Michael Scott, a former Madison, Wisconsin, police officer and now a criminologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. \"There's a risk that some people will interpret this action as the president saying, 'You are soldiers in our revolution.'\"\n\nMany who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 were acting based on President Trump's false claims of winning the 2020 election and were aiming to prevent the certification of Mr. Biden's victory that was scheduled to occur that day.\n\nThe concerns about President Trump's pardons aren't merely about abstract principles. People who attacked officers physically on Jan. 6, and against whom officers testified in court, are being freed. Those individuals have heard President Trump call them \"patriots\" and \"political prisoners.\"\n\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in organizing the Capitol riot, has called for retribution against those who investigated and prosecuted the Jan. 6 defendants.\n\n\"The people who did this, they need to feel the heat,\" Mr. Tarrio said on a podcast after his release this week. \"We need to find and put them behind bars for what they did.\"\n\nAt least one former D.C. law enforcement officer has said he sought a protective order this week, unsuccessfully, against those who assaulted him on Jan. 6.\n\nMany beat cops have enjoyed Mr. Trump's pro-police banter over the past decade, especially after controversial incidents including the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer prompted protests demanding police reform across the nation. Police unions' early endorsement of Mr. Trump likely played a part in his 2016 victory.\n\nBut the unions' pushback this week against the president's new pardons is no surprise, experts say.\n\n\"If their support is truly rooted in [the belief] that Trump is committed to a more aggressive understanding of the criminal justice system, well, this isn't that,\" says Benjamin Levin, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law.\n\nThe pardons for those who attacked the U.S. Capitol included those who didn't commit violence as well as those who carried firearms, Tasers, and knives into the melee, according to the U.S. attorney's office.\n\nJuries also convicted some on charges of seditious conspiracy, which refers to activities that undermine a state without directly attacking it.\n\nMr. Trump defended the pardons to reporters this week at the White House.\n\n\"They've served years in jail,\" Mr. Trump said, according to press accounts. \"They should not have served,\" he said, adding, \"We pardoned people that were treated unbelievably poorly.\"\n\nPeople convicted of hurting or killing police officers routinely face the toughest of sentences compared with other crime convictions.\n\nIn opposing the Jan. 6 punishments, Trump supporters often suggest that there was a failure to hold social justice rioters on the political left to account. But during the 2020 protests, some of which were accompanied by rioting, police arrested at least 11,000 people , according to a tally by BuzzFeed.\n\nMr. Trump also defended his move by citing Mr. Biden's slew of pardons, including those for House Jan. 6 committee members and his own relatives.\n\nEven as the avalanche of presidential pardons may set a worrisome precedent, Professor Levin says there is also room for meaningful reforms in the U.S. criminal justice system - including raising awareness among reform skeptics about how abstract notions of crime and punishment play out in the real world.\n\n\"Part of what makes the reaction to Jan. 6 interesting is the degree to which Trump and his supporters are more willing to look at the context of punishment,\" he says.\n\nAt the same time, one of the Jan. 6 defendants has objected to Mr. Trump's action. Pamela Hemphill rejected her presidential pardon, telling her local newspaper, the Idaho Statesman, that accepting the pardon \" would be an insult to the Capitol Police officers, to the rule of law, to our nation.''\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nHer sense of affront was mirrored in the reaction from police unions this week.\n\n\"There is a genuine and very deep-seated concern in American law enforcement that much of what they have sworn allegiance to, for a long time, is in jeopardy,\" says Professor Scott, who also served as chief of police in Lauderhill, Florida. \"Police ... give meaning to the Constitution. That [meaning] is essentially being renegotiated. That's profound stuff.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Most of the charges brought against the 950 or so defendants, at least the nonviolent ones, have been for minor offenses such as entering a restricted building or illegally demonstrating in the Capitol.\n\nBut in November Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers extremist group, and one of his subordinates were convicted of seditious conspiracy. It was the first time a jury had found that group planning was involved in the disruption of the certification of President Joe Biden's Electoral College votes.\n\nOn the second anniversary of the storming of the Capitol, the legal landscape is reaching a new, more intense level. Here's a snapshot.\n\nNow the Justice Department is beginning another ambitious, multipart Jan. 6 prosecution, a seditious conspiracy trial against Enrique Tarrio, former Proud Boys national chairman, and four others from the far-right group.\n\nSome Proud Boys played central roles in breaching the Capitol perimeter and the building itself. At the height of the battle one member texted Mr. Tarrio, asking, \"Are we a militia yet?\"\n\nHe answered with one word: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys are one of the key groups accused of preparing to assault the seat of U.S. democracy, says Jon Lewis, research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Their trial - now in jury selection - \"is certainly another big test for the Justice Department,\" says Mr. Lewis.\n\nSince it began the investigation of the Capitol insurrection and the prosecution of those involved, the Department of Justice has characterized it as the largest such law enforcement action in the nation's history. The scale is enormous: Thousands of people were allegedly involved in the melee, ranging from the many demonstrators who merely followed the crowd to a core group that had allegedly prepared for and facilitated illegal entry. On the second anniversary of the storming of the Capitol, here's a snapshot of the legal landscape.\n\nOver the past two years, more than 950 defendants have been arrested in conjunction with Jan. 6, according to a just-released accounting from the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia.\n\n\"The Department of Justice's resolve to hold accountable those who committed crimes on January 6, 2021, has not, and will not, wane,\" says the D.C. attorney's office.\n\nMany of those arrested have faced only minor charges. Approximately 860 defendants have been charged with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building or grounds. But for some, those charges are only a base line. Of those 860 defendants, 91 have also been charged with entering a restricted area with a deadly or dangerous weapon. Some of the longest sentences have been reserved for the 25 people convicted so far of assaulting a police officer, with defendants being sentenced from four to 10 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors have also moved to hold a number of participants to account for more than simply their presence at the Capitol. More than 295 defendants have been charged with corruptly obstructing or impeding a federal proceeding, according to the Department of Justice. The counting of Electoral College votes was disrupted by the riot. Vice President Mike Pence and congressional members finished it later that night.\n\nApproximately 484 Jan. 6 defendants have chosen to plead guilty. In part this is due to the open-and-shut nature of many of their cases. The Justice Department has amassed a trove of social media posts with pictures, words, and video that place people in the Capitol and show what they were doing at the time.\n\nForty individuals have been found guilty at trial. Only one has been acquitted. In April, a federal judge decided that Matthew Martin, a government contractor from New Mexico, was not guilty of four petty offenses related to Jan. 6. At trial Mr. Martin admitted that he had entered the Capitol that day, but insisted that two Capitol Police officers waved him through the door.\n\nSo far, almost 200 people have been sentenced to periods of imprisonment for their actions on Jan. 6. Thomas Webster, a retired New York police officer and Marine veteran, has received the longest sentence: 10 years for assaulting a police officer and engaging in violence with a dangerous weapon.\n\nLike a significant number of Jan. 6 defendants, Mr. Webster has expressed remorse for his actions. At sentencing he said he had been swept up in politics and should never have traveled to Washington to protest the election.\n\n\"I wish the events of that horrible day had never happened,\" he told the judge.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the judges overseeing riot-related prosecutions have used their forums to expound in general on the dangers of Jan. 6.\n\nIn October, a U.S. district judge sentenced a Texas man who had joined the Capitol mob to 45 days in prison even though prosecutors had not asked for jail time.\n\nIt is false to compare the Capitol rioters to the people who have demonstrated, mostly peacefully, for civil rights in recent years, said Judge Tanya Chutkan.\n\nDoing so \"ignores the very real danger that the Jan. 6 riots pose to the foundation of democracy,\" she said.\n\nThe biggest Jan. 6 trial to date has undoubtedly been that of Oath Keeper leader Mr. Rhodes and his subordinates. In November, a jury delivered a mixed verdict, finding Mr. Rhodes and one aide guilty of seditious conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding, among other charges, though not guilty of two separate sedition charges. Three other Oath Keepers were found not guilty of sedition, but guilty of other felonies. Mr. Rhodes faces up to 20 years in federal prison on the seditious conspiracy charge alone.\n\nThe verdict appeared to reflect the jury's judgment of culpability in the situation, said some legal experts, with leaders held most accountable. Though not a complete victory for the Justice Department, the verdict ratified prosecutors' core contention: Mr. Rhodes and his group had a concrete plan to disrupt congressional proceedings in an attempt to block Mr. Biden from ascending to the presidency.\n\nAs part of their case, prosecutors showed the jury hundreds of encrypted text messages between Oath Keeper members discussing means of preventing the transfer of presidential power, and talking about wild conspiracy theories, such as a fear that Mr. Biden would hand control of the United States over to the United Nations.\n\nThe Proud Boys trial is the Justice Department's next step up the prosecution ladder. Prosecutors will argue that five members of the group, including former leader Mr. Tarrio, similarly developed a plan to try to block the Electoral College vote-counting in Congress on Jan. 6.\n\nMr. Tarrio has depicted his group as more interested in partying than partisan warfare. He was not present in Washington on the day of the riot. He was arrested two days earlier on charges related to vandalizing property belonging to a historic Black church during a previous Washington visit. Ordered out of D.C., he left - but not before meeting with Oath Keeper leader Mr. Rhodes in an underground garage.\n\nThe Proud Boys trial in Washington is in its early stages. Jury selection should be wrapped up early next week.

It could be another step for the Justice Department in proving that the riot was the result of organized preplanning.\n\n\"But I think the bigger question is, what comes next?\" Mr. Lewis says.\n\nOne answer to that could be more of the same - the Justice Department has vowed to continue its pursuit of individual Jan. 6 participants. Special counsel Jack Smith has the responsibility of weighing whether former President Trump and his top aides and advisers are charged in any way for trying to block the transfer of American power.\n\nBut in terms of trying to address the larger problem of extremism in America - the sort of force that drove a crowd of Americans into the Capitol two years ago - perhaps law enforcement needs to look down, not up.\n\nMuch of the domestic extremist violence in America is driven by individuals who self-radicalize, seizing on conspiracy theories and social media disinformation as explanations for their problems, says Mr. Lewis.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

From the profoundly impactful to the merely performative, the newly reinstalled U.S. president's executive actions have captured the attention of Washington, the nation, and the world.\n\nNobody should be surprised. During the 2024 campaign, he promised pardons to the legions who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, protesting what they claimed was a stolen election after his 2020 loss. He promised to close the southern border, suspend refugee and asylum programs, and set in motion efforts to deport unauthorized immigrants. He promised to end federal diversity programs.\n\nThis week, President Trump signed orders aimed at implementing much of his agenda. He also directed \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans, a Day 1 action that highlighted his goal of bringing down inflation - but is clearly something that can't be accomplished by presidential fiat.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first-week executive orders back up his campaign promises. But some drew criticism, and the momentum may be hard to sustain.\n\nBy week's end, the fire hose of blockbuster executive actions seemed a blur, almost impossible to absorb amid the jarring shift from the mostly Washington-establishment ways of President Joe Biden to the norm-defying return of Mr. Trump.\n\nIn his opening days, Mr. Trump has taken a near-daily barrage of reporter questions - more, it seems, than President Biden took in the past year - holding impromptu press conferences in the Oval Office as he signed orders. On Friday, he embarked on a trip to North Carolina, California, and Nevada to focus on disaster relief and tax cuts.\n\nIn fact, this week's furious pace is by design, presidential scholars say.\n\n\"The fire hose is the point,\" says Kenneth Lowande, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \"The point of all of it is to say he's checked the boxes and kept his promises.\"\n\nNotably, one campaign pledge Mr. Trump has kept in reserve is his vow to institute tariffs of 10% or 20% on imports. This caution suggests an acknowledgment that tariffs are risky - potentially inflationary, and thus could be especially harmful to the blue-collar voters who helped Mr. Trump win last November.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing this week, Treasury Secretary-designate Scott Bessent touted the potential benefits of tariffs as a spur to domestic production, a revenue raiser, and a point of leverage in negotiations with other countries.\n\nBut this week's \"Trump-quake\" isn't about the finer points of economic policy. It's about the bold return to office of a man who has pledged to shake up business as usual and reestablish himself as a forceful presence on a global stage increasingly dominated by strongmen. As his supporters cheer, many other Americans are recoiling at the return of a deeply divisive figure.\n\nThe week has been marked by one remarkable image after another. Witness that of Stewart Rhodes, founder of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, who showed up in the U.S. Capitol Wednesday after his release from prison. He had been convicted of seditious conspiracy for helping direct the attack on the Capitol and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump commuted Mr. Rhodes' sentence to time served, part of the president's order of clemency for the nearly 1,600 Jan. 6 rioters prosecuted. Most received full pardons.\n\nAmong the more than 130 law enforcement officers injured in the riot, as well as federal judges who presided over the trials of rioters, the pardons and commutations elicited cries of frustration.\n\n\"I feel betrayed by my country,\" said former D.C. police officer Michael Fanone , whose attackers were pardoned.\n\nIn his executive order aimed at Jan. 6 rioters released late Monday, Mr. Trump said he was ending a \"grave national injustice\" to begin a \"process of national reconciliation.\" Judge Beryl Howell, chief of the D.C. District Court at the time of the Jan. 6 attack, rejected the characterization.\n\n\"That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law,\" Judge Howell wrote Wednesday .\n\nTrump defenders raise Mr. Biden's last-minute, preemptive pardons of prominent Trump critics as well as Biden family members as a counter to the current president's pardon gambit. Ultimately, says Professor Lowande at the University of Michigan, the burst of pardons from both men reflected one of the few unchecked powers that presidents enjoy.\n\n\"It was a whiplash moment,\" says Mr. Lowande, author of the new book \"False Front,\" which analyzes presidential power and its limits. But the pardon power, he says, \"illustrates that these people are human, and when you have power like that, it's very difficult to refrain from using it.\"\n\nIn contrast, many of Mr. Trump's other executive actions will face constraints, either via litigation, the need for congressional action, or bureaucratic hurdles. Mr. Trump's order Monday ending birthright citizenship, a feature of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, was blocked temporarily by a federal judge. The order would deny automatic citizenship to children born to parents living in the United States illegally.\n\nOther Trump orders aimed at unauthorized immigrants also face litigation and a motivated sanctuary movement. Still, the moves have already had a chilling effect - on everyone from would-be border-crossers and refugees to people already in the country without legal status. This week, Mr. Trump suspended migrants' ability to seek asylum via the southern border, a move that will be fought in court.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Trump's promised efforts to attack the \"deep state\" and \"wokeness\" have taken shape quickly. He has reinstituted his Schedule F plan that would allow for the firing of thousands of federal civil servants. And he has ordered the closing of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" offices in the federal government - placing DEI employees on administrative leave as of Jan. 22. He has also ordered federal agencies to identify the most \"discriminatory DEI practitioners\" in corporations and nonprofits in their jurisdiction.\n\nBy taking such bold action on Day 1 and beyond, using his Oval Office bully pulpit and an ever-present White House press corps to spread the word, Mr. Trump has established \"heroic expectations\" for his presidency, says Jennifer Mercieca, an expert on presidential communication at Texas A&M University.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIn his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump claimed a mandate from God after surviving a would-be assassin's bullet, and vowed nothing short of remaking the entire federal government, Professor Mercieca notes in an email. And he has declared a new \"manifest destiny\" for the nation, promising national expansion.\n\n\"He has promised his followers that he'll solve all of their problems and restore their hope for the nation,\" Ms. Mercieca writes. But, she adds, these are \"unrealistic expectations that will be difficult to satisfy.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Log in\n\nWe want to bridge divides to reach everyone.\n\n\"It was all the chatter. All the chats ... and the fact they wanted to do so much in secret.\"\n\nThat's what a juror said following Thursday's conviction of four members of the Proud Boys far-right extremist group for plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The juror told Vice News that it was the Proud Boys' own texts and messages that convinced the jury the men had engaged in seditious conspiracy - an effort to \"overthrow, put down, or destroy by force\" the U.S. government.\n\nThe verdict is important for two reasons. First, it's a symbol of the grinding Justice Department effort to hold accountable those responsible for Jan. 6. As of April , law enforcement had arrested 1,020 people for participating in the Capitol assault.\n\nMost of those brought to trial have faced only minor charges. But more than 400 have faced prosecution for higher-level crimes, and at least 237 have been sentenced to prison.\n\nSecond, Thursday's conviction hints at prosecutions that may come. Followers of two extremist groups have now been convicted of seditious conspiracy: Oath Keepers in March, and yesterday, Proud Boys. It is possible the Justice Department is becoming increasingly confident in its ability to win complex Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy cases.\n\nThe question is whether special counsel Jack Smith will indict former President Donald Trump and other political organizers of the Jan. 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally for their roles prior to the riot.\n\nAfter all, in closing arguments at the Proud Boy trial, defense lawyer Nayib Hassan said the attack wasn't the Proud Boys' fault.\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's words. It was his motivation. It was his anger that caused what occurred on January 6th,\" he said.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

For writers, who went on strike this week, that question isn't just a monetary one. It's also a matter of feeling seen and valued.\n\n( 5 min. read )\n\nThe increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has strictly curbed press freedom.

But the crowning of Charles III tomorrow holds something new - a multihued recitation of Christianity's most sacred prayer led not just by the head of the Anglican Church, but by Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, and Hindu clerics as well.\n\nThis unique moment of worship - congregants will be invited to speak the Lord's Prayer in any language - reflects the new king's view of his realm as \"a community of communities.\" Yet a deeper symbolism is hard to ignore. A monarchy that once spread its language and power around the globe is having to adapt to a world shaping its own narratives of dignity and equality.\n\nOne place where that change is evident is just across the English Channel, where an Algerian film opened this week in a dozen theaters in Paris. Called \"The Last Queen,\" it tells the story of a woman who saves Algiers from foreign invasion in the 16th century. Historians debate whether the story, which has floated through Algerian lore for hundreds of years, is true. But for audiences, the film's depiction of Algerian society is what counts.\n\n\"In the movies, our country is still viewed mainly in the context of colonization and the years of terrorism,\" Adila Bendimerad, an Algerian actor who stars in the film and co-directed it, told Le Monde. \"Algerians living in France, French people of Algerian origin, French people, people from elsewhere: Everyone has been moved by this story and this Algeria that they were not aware of.\"\n\nThe film points to the uses of history at a time when many societies are rethinking their legacies under colonial rule. For many African societies, that means moving beyond a mentality of victimhood and exploitation. In her new book on African childhood, for example, Sarah Duff, a South African anthropologist, challenges stereotypes about how Africans view themselves.\n\n\"Thinking historically is important for showing us that the present was never inevitable: that there were and are alternative ways of addressing challenges, alternative choices, and alternative ways of understanding our societies,\" she said in an interview at Colby University.\n\nA new exhibit by the Pakistani artist Misha Japanwala in New York has a similar goal. A collection of castings of hands and the female form, it challenges the sense of shame and invisibility that women in Islamic societies endure. \"When so much of our existence has been subject to a campaign of disappearance, this collection is a present day, physical reminder that our lives and our stories are part of the fabric of our people, and will continue to be so even hundreds of years from now,\" she told The New York Times.\n\nA world of many voices, Charles has acknowledged, \"has led me to understand that the Sovereign has an additional duty - less formally recognized but to be no less diligently discharged. It is the duty to protect ... the space for faith itself and its practice through the religions, cultures, traditions, and beliefs to which our hearts and minds direct us as individuals.\" A monarchy that once spread its language across the globe is refitting itself for a world shaped by the voices of others.\n\nEach weekday, the Monitor includes one clearly labeled religious article offering spiritual insight on contemporary issues, including the news. The publication - in its various forms - is produced for anyone who cares about the progress of the human endeavor around the world and seeks news reported with compassion, intelligence, and an essentially constructive lens. For many, that caring has religious roots. For many, it does not. The Monitor has always embraced both audiences. The Monitor is owned by a church - The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston - whose founder was concerned with both the state of the world and the quality of available news.\n\n( 3 min. read )\n\nGetting to know Spirit as our divine Parent gives us a more expansive view of ourselves and brings healing results.\n\nJames Wright (l.), a sophomore at Owensboro High School, learns how to weld a bead on a beam from Collin Baldwin, a pipe welder for Envision Contracting, during an annual Construction Career Day, Thursday, Apr. 24, 2025, in Owensboro, Ky.

More the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nTarrio will be sentenced by Judge Timothy Kelly.\n\nThe Justice Department requested a 33-year sentence for Tarrio, after prosecutors said Tarrio and three other Proud Boys \"unleashed a force on the Capitol that was calculated to exert their political will on elected officials by force and to undo the results of a democratic election.\"\n\nAttorneys representing Tarrio argued for a lesser sentence, suggesting Tarrio had cooperated with law enforcement for several undercover drug investigations after he was convicted of fraud in 2012 and that his mental health has suffered while in jail.\n\nKelly has given multi-year prison terms to some of the other convicted Proud Boys, but has typically sentenced them to less time than the government requested.\n\nTarrio's sentence hearing was initially scheduled for August 30, but was later rescheduled to September 5 because Kelly was at home sick.\n\nA 33-year sentence would be the longest punishment given to anyone charged in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Ethan Nordean, a former leader of the Proud Boys, was sentenced to 18 years last week, tied for the longest sentence given so far. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes was also sentenced to 18 years. The second-longest Capitol riot punishment was given to Joseph Biggs-another Proud Boys leader-last week, after Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Tarrio is the last Proud Boy to be sentenced, after Zachary Rehl and Domenic Pezzola were sentenced to 15 and 10 years in prison, respectively.\n\nTarrio and three other Proud Boys members-Biggs, Nordean and Rehl-were convicted of seditious conspiracy in May following a monthslong trial that included several hurdles, while Pezzola was acquitted of seditious conspiracy but found guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to prevent federal officers from doing their duties. During the trial, one juror indicated that someone had approached her to ask if she was a juror, though other jurors speculated whether she was telling the truth. Some jurors also suggested that they had been \"accosted\" during the trial, according to CNN .\n\nTarrio and four other Proud Boys were charged by the Justice Department in June 2022 for their involvement in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Tarrio wasn't present at the riot due to an arrest two days earlier, but prosecutors say he organized and directed the attack on the Capitol, citing messages between Tarrio and other Proud Boys that suggested the group would keep Trump in power \"by any means necessary, including force.\" Prosecutors argued Tarrio and the four members claimed credit for the attack, including a video shared by Biggs to other members in which he said: \"We've just taken the Capitol.\" Tarrio's attorneys argue he was used as a \"scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and those in power,\" according to his attorneys. The Proud Boys were formed in 2016 by Vice cofounder Gavin McInnis, who said the all-male group was a club for \"Western Chauvinists.\" The far-right group's members have been tied to street brawls and face-offs with left-leaning protestors. Trump referenced the group during a debate in September 2020, when he said the Proud Boys should \"stand back and stand by.\"\n\nProud Boy Shouts, 'Trump Won!'

Biggs encouraged members of the Proud Boys and others to attend the rally, while also obtaining paramilitary gear and supplies in preparation for the attack. While leading a group toward the Capitol, Biggs said in a video that he and the rioters were \"taking [the Capitol] back right now.\" The Proud Boys-formed by Vice cofounder Gavin McInnis in 2016-has been connected to street brawls and other face-offs with left-leaning protesters leading up to January 6. Attorneys representing Tarrio-the group's chairman-previously argued the group was used as a \"scapegoat for Donald J.

Oath Keepers wouldn't have been there but for Stewart Rhodes, I don't think anyone contends otherwise. He was the one who gave the order to go, and they went.\"\n\nAn 18-year sentence is the longest Capitol riot sentence imposed so far, after more than 1,000 indictments over the last two years, according to the Associated Press. The previous record was 14 years, after Peter Schwartz was convicted of felony assault and other charges earlier this month for pepper-spraying police officers outside the Capitol.\n\nMeggs and four other members of the Oath Keepers also convicted of seditious conspiracy-Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel and Edward Vallejo-are to be sentenced later Thursday.\n\nRhodes founded the Oath Keepers, a nationwide right-wing militia group, in 2009, after he says he witnessed President George W. Bush abusing his presidency, according to the New York Times . Rhodes previously served in the military from 1983 to 1989 and worked for Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). Prosecutors argued Rhodes and other Oath Keepers members \"agreed to do whatever was necessary\" to prevent the certification of President Joe Biden's election win on January 6, though Rhodes' attorneys said \"there was no plan\" for the group to attack the Capitol. His conviction on seditious conspiracy charges was the first since 1995, when an Egyptian cleric and nine followers were found guilty of a plot to bomb New York City landmarks.\n\nMembers of the Proud Boys, a far-right group, have also been charged for their involvement in the January 6 riot.

      "text": "Four Proud Boys Found Guilty Of Seditious Conspiracy Over January 6\n\nFour Proud Boys were found guilty Thursday of seditious conspiracy for their role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, following four months of court proceedings.\n\nProud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio was found guilty of seditious conspiracy.\n\nProud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio and members Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean and Zachary Rehl were each found guilty Thursday of seditious conspiracy, though the jury failed to reach a verdict on the charge against Dominic Pezzola.\n\nAll four could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors argued Tarrio organized and directed an attack on the Capitol by members of the organization, citing messages between the defendants that indicated the group would keep former President Donald Trump in power \"by any means necessary, including force.\"\n\nAttorneys representing Tarrio argued the group had no plan to attack the Capitol, and that Trump-who urged protestors to \"fight like hell\"-had provoked the riot, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA sixth Proud Boys member, Charles Donohoe, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and assaulting, resisting or impeding officers in April 2022.\n\nProsecutor Conor Mulroe said in his closing argument that the organization was \"lined up behind Donald Trump and willing to commit violence on his behalf,\" according to the Washington Post .\n\nCharges of sedition or treason are historically rare in the U.S., according to the Associated Press. Prior to trials involving members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers -another far-right organization charged in connection to the Capitol riots-fewer than 12 Americans had ever been convicted.\n\nThe group was formed in 2016 by Vice cofounder Gavin McInnis, who cast the all-male group was a club for \"Western Chauvinists.\" Some members of the far-right group were known for their involvement in street brawls and tense face-offs with left-leaning protesters. The Justice Department charged Tarrio and four other Proud Boys in June 2022, more than a year after rioters at the Capitol tried to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's election win on January 6, 2021. Prosecutors argued Tarrio-who was not present during the riot following an arrest two days earlier-and the four other members had claimed credit for the Capitol attack, citing messages on social media and an encrypted chat room. Nayib Hassan, an attorney representing Tarrio, argued Tarrio was used as \"a scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and those in power.\" The group was previously referenced by Trump during a debate in September 2020, when he told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" adding, \"Somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left.\"\n\nThe trial faced several hurdles over its 15 weeks, including the introduction of new evidence and concerns one juror was being followed . The juror told the court someone had approached her to ask if she was a juror, though other jurors speculated the validity of her claims.

      "text": "Trump Town Hall: Trump Open To Pardoning Proud Boys For Seditious Conspiracy-And Calls Jan. 6 'Beautiful Day'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump did not rule out pardoning the four Proud Boys members convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the January 6 Capitol riot during a live town hall with CNN on Wednesday-where he refused to acknowledge wrongdoing in connection with the deadly insurrection and said \"a large portion\" of the convicted rioters would be pardoned.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago estate Tuesday, April 4, 2023, in Palm Beach, ... More Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nWhen asked by a member of the audience if he would pardon members of the far-right Proud Boys group found guilty of seditious conspiracy last week, Trump said, \"I don't know. I would have to look at their case, but I will say, in Washington, D.C., you can not get a fair trial.\"\n\nIf Trump is reelected in 2024, he vowed to \"pardon many\" of the 600-some people who have been convicted by the Justice Department in connection with the January 6 Capitol riot, which led to the deaths of at least five people, adding \"many of them are just great people.\"\n\nTrump also reiterated evidence-free claims of fraud in the 2020 election and refused to accept blame for the events, despite repeatedly telling his supporters in the weeks leading up to January 6 to \"fight\" Congress' certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe former president defended the thousands who showed up to support him on January 6, telling CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins \"they were there with love in their heart. That was an unbelievable and that was a beautiful day.\"\n\nProud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio and members Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl were found guilty Thursday of seditious conspiracy, among other federal charges-one of the most serious and significant convictions in connection with the riots. Several members of the far-right Oath Keepers were also convicted of seditious conspiracy earlier this year.\n\nThe town hall marks Trump's first CNN appearance since 2016, and comes a day after a jury found him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump participated in the live event from Saint Anselm College as he seeks to make inroads with voters outside of the conservative media platforms he typically frequents, the New York Times reported , noting the move is also designed to draw contrast with his top competitor in the GOP presidential primary race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who typically avoids mainstream media. Trump won New Hampshire in the 2016 primary, and the state will be the first to vote in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. Trump has a rocky history with CNN and specifically Collins, who he frequently sparred with during his time in office. Trump on Tuesday predicted the town hall \"could be the beginning of a New & Vibrant CNN, with no more Fake News, or it could turn into a disaster for all, including me,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump headed into Wednesday's town hall with a firm lead in polls that show him trouncing DeSantis-who has not yet announced a 2024 run-by double-digit margins, despite Trump's April indictment in Manhattan Criminal Court and multiple other law enforcement probes into his conduct. Trump has successfully spun the investigations as political witch hunts to rally his GOP base and Republican lawmakers. But the Republican reaction to the Carroll verdict on Tuesday stood in contrast to the broad support he garnered from the party in the wake of the Manhattan District Attorney's indictment against him. Multiple GOP lawmakers expressed concern about the verdict that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the 1990s and lied about it. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a frequent Trump critic who is also considering running for the GOP 2024 nomination, called Trump's reaction to the verdict, in which he repeated his claim that he didn't know Carroll, \"ridiculous.\" Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) also cast doubts on his electability.\n\nTrump Leads DeSantis By 46 Points In Widest Margin Yet (Forbes)\n\nTrump Calls E.

Ty Roush is a breaking news reporter based in New York City.\n\nBy Ty Roush ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nStewart Rhodes-the founder of the far-right Oath Keepers militia-was found guilty on charges of seditious conspiracy Tuesday, according to multiple news outlets , nearly two years after a crowd supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nStewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers.\n\nAfter three days of deliberations, jurors also found fellow Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs guilty of seditious conspiracy, while three other defendants-Kenneth Harrelson, Thomas Caldwell and Jessica Watkins-were acquitted, CNN and NBC reported.\n\nAll five defendants were also reportedly found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding after they tried to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election win on January 6, 2021.\n\nProsecutors argued Rhodes and the other co-defendants \"agreed to do whatever was necessary, up to and including force and violence, to stop the [2020] election result from becoming finalized\" on January 6, according to a Reuters report.\n\nJames Lee Bright, one of Rhodes' attorneys, argued \"there was no plan\" or \"meeting of the minds\" for the group to attack the Capitol, with Rhodes-who has not been accused of entering the Capitol- calling some rioters' decision to enter the building \"off-mission.\"\n\nThe conviction on a charge of sedition or treason is rare in U.S. history, according to the Associated Press, as fewer than 12 Americans have ever been convicted.\n\nRhodes and Meggs could face a maximum of 20 years in prison for the seditious conspiracy charges.\n\n\"Our democracy is fragile,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said during her closing arguments, adding Rhodes had repeatedly called for the \"violent overthrow\" of the U.S. government following Biden's election victory, according to the AP. \"It cannot exist without respect for the rule of law, and it will not survive if people dissatisfied with the results of an election can use force and violence to change the outcome.\"\n\nRhodes served in the military between 1983 and 1989 before working for Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). He then founded the Oath Keepers, a nationwide right-wing militia group, in 2009 after he says he witnessed President George W. Bush abusing his presidency, according to the New York Times . Following the outcome of the 2020 election, Oath Keepers acted as security guards at pro-Trump rallies in Washington D.C. Rhodes has since denied any involvement in the January 6 assault on the Capitol, adding \"it was nowhere in the mission scope at all\" during his testimony. Three members of the group have since pleaded guilty to charges of seditious conspiracy, including Brian Ulrich, William Todd Wilson and Joshua James. Several members of the far-right Proud Boys were also charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged role in the Capitol riot, one of the most severe charges leveled against the over 900 riot defendants.\n\nThe Justice Department last secured a guilty verdict on seditious conspiracy charges in 1995, when an Egyptian cleric and nine followers were convicted of plotting to bomb New York City landmarks. Several members of a Christian militia group were charged with seditious conspiracy more than a decade ago, but a judge dismissed the charges .\n\nTrump May Testify To Jan. 6 Committee As Deadline Looms, Liz Cheney Suggests ( Forbes )\n\nOath Keepers Trial: Prosecutor Alleges Far-Right Militia 'Concocted Armed Rebellion' To 'Shatter' American Democracy ( Forbes )"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nStewart Rhodes, founder of the right-wing militia group Oath Keepers , was found guilty of seditious conspiracy for planning to violently overthrow President Joe Biden 's 2020 Electoral College victory.\n\nRhodes is the latest January 6 rioter to be convicted for transgressions that day, when supporters of ousted President Donald Trump sieged the U.S. Capitol in a failed effort to force Congress to block Biden's win. Throughout his seven-week trial, prosecutors sought to paint Rhodes as seeking to plot a violent insurrection aimed at disrupting the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nRhodes could face 20 years in prison. A jury found Rhodes and Kelly Meggs, the Florida Oath Keepers leader, guilty of the rarely used seditious conspiracy charge. Prior to the jury's decision on Tuesday, the charge had not been used for decades in the U.S.\n\nThe United States Code defines seditious conspiracy as conspiring to \"overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States or to levy war against them.\"\n\nIt also defines the charge as using force to \"prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States\" or to \"seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof.\"\n\nLawmakers created the seditious conspiracy law following the Civil War. It was used to charge Southerners who fought against the U.S. government and could continue to do so. The charge is rarely used nowadays, as it is seen as difficult to prove due to its broad definition.\n\nNo one had been convicted of seditious conspiracy since 1995, when Omar Abdel-Rahman was found guilty for his role in planning to bomb the World Trade Center in 1993. He died in federal prison in 2017 .\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2010 brought seditious conspiracy charges against members of the Hutaree militia, accusing the group of planning an uprising against the government, according to the Associated Press. A judge acquitted the charge, arguing prosecutors did not prove the militia had a detailed plan to do so.\n\nLegal experts on Tuesday praised the DOJ for successfully prosecuting Rhodes.\n\n\"Great work by DOJ to charge seditious conspiracy and make the case that attacking Congress to stop the transfer of presidential power is a serious crime. Accountability is essential to deterrence,\" tweeted former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade.\n\nCourt documents revealed messages exchanged between Rhodes and other Oath Keepers ahead of the riot. In one, Rhodes wrote : \"We will have to do a bloody, massively bloody revolution against them.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nStewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right extremist group Oath Keepers convicted of seditious conspiracy in the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday following President Donald Trump 's commutation of his 18-year prison sentence.\n\nRhodes' visit occurred a day after he was released from prison as a result of Trump's executive order, which benefitted more than 1,500 people charged with federal crimes related to the January 6 riot. Rhodes had been convicted in one of the most serious cases prosecuted by the Justice Department stemming from the riot, which resulted in injuries to more than 100 police officers.\n\nRhodes, donning a Trump 2020 hat, arrived on Capitol Hill to advocate for the release of another defendant. He was one of 14 people sentenced for their involvement in the riot whose sentences were commuted. Rhodes informed reporters that he plans to urge Trump to grant him a full pardon.\n\nNearly 1,600 people faced federal charges related to the Capitol riot. More than 1,000 of them pleaded guilty, while roughly 250 were convicted by a judge or jury following trials. More than 1,100 were sentenced and more than 700 received prison terms ranging from several days to 22 years.\n\nDuring the riot, more than 130 police officers were injured. At least four officers who were at the Capitol that day later died by suicide. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was assaulted with pepper spray, suffered two strokes and died on January 7. A medical examiner later concluded that he died of natural causes.\n\nOn Wednesday, judges in Washington's federal court dismissed numerous pending cases against January 6 defendants. Several judges expressed their regret in written orders over the abrupt conclusion of the prosecutions, noting that Trump's mass pardons would not alter the truth about the mob's assault on a cornerstone of American democracy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly emphasized that evidence of the riot is preserved through the \"neutral lens\" of videos, trial transcripts, jury verdicts and judicial opinions.\n\n\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies,\" she wrote.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan , who oversaw Trump's election interference case prior to its dismissal, said that the president's pardons for hundreds of January 6 rioters cannot alter the \"tragic truth.\" Chutkan further noted that her order to dismiss the case against an Illinois man charged with firing a gun into the air during the riot does not \"diminish the heroism of law enforcement officers\" who defended the Capitol.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote in her dismissal of the Illinois man: \"It cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote the heroism of officers who defended the Capitol: \"Grossly outnumbered, those law enforcement officers acted valiantly to protect the Members of Congress , their staff, the Vice President and his family, the integrity of the Capitol grounds, and the Capitol Building-our symbol of liberty and a symbol of democratic rule around the world.\"\n\nMatthew M. Graves, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia: \"More people were convicted of seditious conspiracy in connection with the siege of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, than any other criminal event since the statute was enacted during the Civil War.\"\n\nTrump's pardoning spree is likely to face ongoing scrutiny as part of the broader political and legal fallout from the events of January 6, 2021.\n\nUpdate 1/22/25, 5:38 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and a new headline.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

      "text": "I Helped Exonerate a Proud Boy of Seditious Conspiracy\n\nSteven Alan Metcalf is a Criminal Defense Lawyer at his Manhattan-based law firm Metcalf & Metcalf.\n\nUser-generated content. Lightly edited.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIt was 10.30 a.m. on a Thursday when we received an email from the court telling us the jury had submitted note number nine. It was the nineteenth excruciating week of this trial, and the jury had been deliberating for its second week.\n\nThe majority of the defense counsel was staying at the attorney lodge in the courthouse. Having been waiting-and unable to fill time without speculating what jurors were doing, thinking, and saying to each other-we were all highly stressed.\n\nWaiting for a jury to deliberate is a feeling like none other; no matter how much you attempt to work on something else, your mind goes back to the jury sitting in a room deciding your client's fate.\n\nThis time the stakes could not have been higher, and I was feeling the pressure.\n\nThe email told us there was a partial verdict. Oh no . A partial verdict is usually not good for defendants and typically means the jury must go back to finalize what they could not already agree on.\n\nWhen I arrived, everybody on the defense side of the room looked pale. I read the jury note, which stated in substance: We are undecided on count one, which is a seditious conspiracy, for only Dominic Pezzola, and count two, which is another conspiracy for only Pezzola.\n\nThere were issues with two of the other counts, but the jury had reached verdicts on everything else. Everyone was in complete shock.\n\nAfter the partial verdict was read to a completely packed courtroom, journalists seemed to be having a field day in reporting that four of the top Proud Boys were found guilty of seditious conspiracy.\n\nDominic Pezzola, who I referred to throughout the entire trial as \"Dom\", remained the only defendant who was yet to be convicted, and still stood a chance to beat two conspiracy counts-including the top charge of seditious conspiracy.\n\nI met Dom. Because the jury had not specifically stated they were deadlocked yet, the consensus I came to was they would keep deliberating until they also found Dom guilty of the two remaining conspiracies.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon, waiting on the verdict of those two counts, was a blur. It felt like an eternity before we returned to court after jury note ten was submitted.\n\nWe were told the jury could not reach a verdict on two of Dom's charges-the second conspiracy count, and count eight of an assault charge. For the top charge of seditious conspiracy, Dom was found not guilty.\n\nI really did not know what to think. I will never forget sitting at the defense table and hearing those words. I felt like I could breathe for the first time in months.\n\nThe judge then granted a mistrial for the other conspiracy charge against Pezzola, and the remaining assault count. This was a huge victory for us.\n\nWhen I received a call on January 14, 2021, telling me one of my former clients had been arrested for his involvement in the Capitol riots, I didn't think these cases were out of the ordinary.\n\nAs a criminal defense attorney, I don't let my morals or political beliefs dictate how I handle a case-I care about the evidence and the law, which is devoid of emotion.\n\nI agreed to represent an outspoken young man called Edward \"Jake\" Lang, who I had come to know well after representing a few years before January 6th, and for me it was business as usual.\n\nAt the beginning, I treated his case the same way I would have any other, but looking back I realize I was completely wrong; how these cases have proceeded is anything but normal.\n\nThe first day, for example, I attempted to negotiate a bond package with the government. However, it soon became clear to me that negotiations were completely off the table. This was coming straight down from Washington, D.C., and the outcome would be harsh.\n\nAround 30 days after his arrest, Jake was moved to the U.S. capital, and I felt the treatment he and others involved on January 6 received was horrifying. They were being thrown in the hole for months at a time.\n\nWhile I don't think there's a straightforward answer to whether every person who took part on January 6 was punished excessively, individually, I feel there are a lot of people who have been treated unfairly, and their conditions thus far have been exceptionally harsh. These cases have destroyed people and their families' lives.\n\nA selected handful of these individuals are being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, without question, solely to make an example of them. Is that fair and equal protection under the law?\n\nShortly after taking Jake's case, he told me over the phone that he was being held with other men involved on January 6, who had bad lawyers and needed help. I couldn't help them all, so I asked him to give me a list of men he was close to and promised to look at their cases.\n\nDominic Pezzola's was one that stood out immediately.\n\nHe had been caught on camera breaking a window with a riot shield. I thought they were going to make an example of him no matter what, and they did-within a couple of days after January 6, his name was brought up on the Senate floor.\n\nHis bond was continuously being denied, but when I read the decisions it made no sense to me. This was a former Marine with no criminal history. He had a wife, two kids, and ran his own flooring company. He was a family man who did everything he could to provide for them.\n\nHe'd never been in trouble before, but had got caught up in whatever was going on during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was looking at this thinking: \"This is crazy. Why has his bond been denied? He should be able to properly prepare for his trial \"\n\nI had no idea something much bigger was planned for him, and that he would end up being superseded into the Proud Boys case. He had only been a Proud Boy for around one month, so I thought he really didn't have much to do with these guys.\n\nI thought if someone deserved a good fight, it was Dom Pezzola.\n\nI have received backlash for my decision to represent Dom. The person who sticks out the most is the mother of a long-term client of mine who called me to tell me she was disgusted with me. I asked her how it differed from her son needing my representation, without my judgment, but she couldn't understand me.\n\nI have received a lot of threatening emails saying things like: \"I hope you die,\" or \"you're disgusting,\" or \"I hope you and your children die.\"\n\nColleagues of mine in different cases have also felt the need to share their political opinions with me, and their opinions about January 6. I have been called the \"attorney for the insurrectionists\" when I walk into certain courtrooms.\n\nThese kinds of comments don't normally affect me. Still, I was shocked that someone I had worked closely with-someone whose family I had taken care of-no longer respected me because I represented someone she did not politically align with.\n\nIt made me realize just how divided our country is right now.\n\nI first met Dom behind a wall of glass at a D.C. jail. We talked through a phone, and it was a horrible setup. I could tell neither the room nor the phone had been cleaned in a long time and I could barely hear him.\n\nMy first impression was that Dom is a man's man-someone who has no problem getting their hands dirty, is a hard worker, and really cares about his family. I felt he was a typical Italian New Yorker.\n\nHe displayed several qualities I admired and having spent a lot of time talking to Dom, I have grown to respect him. Not only is he someone I really went to bat and fought for, I consider him a friend.\n\nInitially, Dom was charged with various charges including assault, resisting or impeding officers, robbery of a police shield, and destruction of the Capitol building. Over a year later, he was superseded into the seditious conspiracy indictment with Proud Boy leaders.\n\nWhile I feel Dom was overcharged on many of these counts, seditious conspiracy blew my mind.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is a unique legal term that dates back to the Civil War era, the essence of which means trying to overthrow your own government, which I feel is nowhere close to what these facts show here, especially in the case of Dom Pezzola.\n\nIn our history, it's always required a substantial amount of force to take over the government. Neither Dom nor his co-defendants brought a weapon that day, so I believe there was no real force component to substantiate those charges.\n\nThe actual language on the verdict form that the jury had to use to find a defendant guilty of seditious conspiracy consisted of two goals, which the jury had to find existed.\n\nGoal one was to oppose by force \"the authority\" of the Government of the United States. Goal two was to use force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States.\n\nI could not understand how they were going to justify using that charge, and it's amazed me how they've been able to weaponize it.\n\nAfter working with Dom for a while, it became clear to me that there was only one count the government was willing to talk about-seditious conspiracy. If any of these guys wanted to take a plea deal, they would have to plead guilty to that charge.\n\nBut this was not an option for Dom, who has a G.I. Bill from his time in the United States Marine Corps which would be canceled if he was convicted of trying to overthrow his own government. I knew we would have to go to trial.\n\nI also knew that Dom's trial was going to be different. We had the full weight of the federal government against us and the event was taking place in D.C., where the majority of residents vote Democrat and despise what happened on January 6.\n\nWe were faced with the worst potential jury pool and the most massive adversary, so regardless of Dom's individual case, we were starting off at a substantial disadvantage. I knew the trial would involve us getting knocked down every single day, but Dom was ready to fight that charge.\n\nWhen I knew what we were up against, I started getting to know the other attorneys and learning about Dom's co-defendants. I spent a lot of time working on Dom's robbery count, which I disputed because I did not feel he had used force to obtain the police shield.\n\nRegarding Dom's assault charge, I argued that he acted in self-defense because there were gunshots constantly going off around him and people being shot near him.\n\nI focused a lot on separating Dominic from everybody else, to distinguish him and get him as far removed from these other defendants as possible. I wanted him to be his own character, his own personality out of New York. I spent months painting and framing that picture.\n\nI restructured the narrative surrounding Dom, by going over detail after detail after detail about what actually happened, over and over again until people were sick of it.\n\nThere were various parts of the trial where I just stayed quiet and let other attorneys hash things out; I needed to send the message that certain arguments were not our fight.\n\nBy the time the jury came back with their verdict on May 4, everybody was physically and mentally exhausted. I wasn't getting paid for my role in the trial and was desperate to get back to New York to see my kids and wife, who was eight months pregnant at the time.\n\nWhen I originally got this case, I worked out an initial retainer with the family but that was exhausted very quickly. By the time Dom stood and testified, he had been in jail for around 28 months and everyone ran out of money, very quickly. There was nothing coming in and there were a lot of promises from various different people, but they fell through.\n\nBy this point, I was in way too deep to say no. I had to move forward, but I was losing substantial amounts of my own money. I spent a large portion of our savings during the course of the trial because there were so many expenses.\n\nI'm happy with the fact that the jury gave true consideration on seditious conspiracy, and found that Dom was not guilty. I believe they could have come to a different decision just because they did not like him, or I, or the Proud Boys.\n\nI fought every day for almost six months and got a small amount of what I fought for and what I believe that we deserved.\n\nDominic wants me to handle his appeal, and there have been various different issues throughout the trial that I look forward to addressing on appeal. I will go forward as best as I can while Dominic still has some substantial exposure.\n\nIn the future, I don't see a vast amount of January 6 fefendants being \"exonerated\" per se. However, everyone has due process rights to ensure that the procedure throughout the course of your case is fair.\n\nEven if you're caught with a smoking gun in your hand, or are up against overwhelming evidence, you're entitled to an attorney, and you're entitled to fair proceedings.\n\nI believe the way some of these cases have been handled from jump street has set up a landscape that has been so one-sided it makes it difficult to defend against the charges and be completely acquitted.\n\nOn the flip side, I feel that there's going to be another round of new arrests of some pretty heavy hitters.\n\nIn this particular case, I believe the government tested a new theory against Enrique Tarrio, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy despite not being present in Washington, D.C. on the day.\n\nSo now, if they can link anyone's emails or text messages to January 6 and call it a conspiracy, they may be able to convict anyone, even those who never stepped foot on the Capitol grounds that day.\n\nUltimately, I think the public is going to start to see that a lot of what they believe is not accurate or that these have been weaponized cases.\n\nI think people are starting to realize much more about January 6 and that certain groups are beginning to consider whether there have been injustices in all of this. I believe that as time goes on, the tides will start to change.\n\nSteven Alan Metcalf is a Criminal Defense Lawyer at his Manhattan-based law firm Metcalf & Metcalf .\n\nAll views expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nAs told to Newsweek's My Turn associate editor, Monica Greep.\n\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWhen asked how history should remember January 6, a rioter who had his 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy commuted by President Donald Trump said it should be remembered as \"Patriots Day.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's mass pardoning and sentence commutations, attempts by some rioters to rename the attempted insurrection to celebrate their actions could result in history being revised, with those involved being seen as victims, not perpetrators.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, over 1,590 rioters violently stormed the Capitol building in what has been proven by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as a coordinated effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The riot left nine people dead. Four rioters died at the riot, and five police officers died after the event. Four of the officers took their own lives, and one died from a stroke after sustaining injuries on the scene.\n\nElmer Stewart Rhodes III, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia group, was given 18 years in federal prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges. The DOJ proved that he was a crucial leader and organizer on January 6, and now he is leading the movement to have the day remembered as \"Patriots Day.\"\n\nRhodes is easily identifiable by his eyepatch as he once shot himself in the eye with his own gun by accident. He was one of the few rioters not pardoned by Trump, but was released from federal prison with his 18-year sentence commuted.\n\nRhodes spoke with News2share wearing a Trump 2020 patch and insisted that he knew the 2020 election was stolen. He said that January 6 should be renamed because he and his fellow rioters were \"standing up for our country.\"\n\nHe said: \"I don't need to see any actual evidence of the fraud, but I know that state laws that are meant to prevent fraud, making it easier to discover fraud, were violated.\" Rhodes also blamed the violence against police at the attempted insurrection on provocation by the police.\n\nJoe Biden did win the 2020 election, and it was certified by Congress including by Trump's vice president, Mike Pence .\n\nRhodes also told News2share that he did not experience any abuse from the prison guards while serving his time, adding: \"Most guards are conservative. Most guards are Trump supporters.\"\n\nElmer Stewart Rhodes III : \"I believe the election was stolen. I believe President Trump has always been right about that.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia : \"More people were convicted of seditious conspiracy in connection with the siege of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, than any other criminal event since the statute was enacted during the Civil War.\"\n\nAnother freed January 6 rioter, Jacob Chansley, the \"Q-Anon Shaman,\" posted on X (formerly Twitter ) after leaving prison: \"Now I am gonna buy some motha f***in guns! \"\n\nThe son of a rioter who testified against his dad has said he is \"terrified\" of his father being released, and that he has picked up a gun and moved to try and protect himself. His father is a member of \"The Three Percenters\" militia group, a group that has seen a surge in recruitment following January 6, according to ProPublica.\n\nRhodes said in his interview that after leaving prison he met up with his fellow January 6 rioters. He did not elaborate on what they discussed.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that those pardoned on January 6 would storm the Capitol with Trump in power, other officials have been targeted by militia groups outside of January 6. For example, five people were found guilty of attempting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSophie Grace Clark is a Live News reporter based in London, with a focus on crime stories.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene is facing calls for her arrest over her comments this weekend about the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, but legal experts say the congresswoman is \"protected\" from being prosecuted over those remarks.\n\nOn Saturday, Greene appeared at a dinner organized by the New York Young Republican Club and said during her speech that if she had organized the attack on the Capitol, \"we would have won.\"\n\n\"Not to mention, we would've been armed,\" she added.\n\nIn response, the White House condemned Greene for boasting \"that she would have succeeded in an armed insurrection against the United States government.\" Political commentators also called for her arrest, citing sedition, which is formally charged as \"seditious conspiracy\" under the U.S. criminal code.\n\nHowever, because sedition is a vaguely defined offense, legal experts say Greene's comments don't face any legal repercussions.\n\nIon Meyn, an assistant law professor at the University of Wisconsin, told Newsweek that although Greene may face negative social consequences for her rhetoric, her comments on an event that has already happened fall under \"protected speech.\"\n\n\"Engaging in hypotheticals about events that already happened is not a crime,\" Meyn said.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agreed, saying the circumstances surrounding her comments also fall short of classifying as seditious conspiracy.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is described by the criminal code as when \"two or more persons in [the U.S.] conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States.\"\n\n\"We don't have that here,\" Rahmani told Newsweek . \"It also requires an actual step in furtherance of the conspiracy, and not just words. That requirement isn't met either.\"\n\n\"Without more, Greene's words are just that: words. She can't be prosecuted for words alone,\" he added.\n\nMeyn also cautioned against trying to bend or stretch the definition of terms carrying legal weight because doing so could send democracy down a slippery slope. He said that suggesting Greene is inciting rebellion with her remarks would accept a \"sweeping interpretation\" that would \"introduce us to a darker chapter of our political dysfunction.\"\n\nMeyn added that enforcing sedition broadly could also \"do serious harm to democracy\" by causing a bigger problem-as a threat to free speech.\n\nOn Monday, Greene defended her comments as \"sarcasm\" and accused the Biden administration of \"trying to weaponize\" her joke.\n\nIn a statement shared to social media, the congresswoman said her remarks expressed her support for the Second Amendment and added that she would \"never allow the White House, Democrats , or the media to continue to accuse me of something I had nothing to do with.\"\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes have been released from prison following a sweeping order by President Donald Trump that overturned a number of sentences for January 6, 2021, Capitol riots offenses, included the seditious conspiracy convictions for the pair of leaders.\n\nTrump's order benefited more than 1,500 defendants involved in the incident.\n\nOne of Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was pardoning about 1,500 people who were convicted in connection with the January 6 attack that saw a mob of his supporters storm the Capitol in a bid to stop the certification of Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory.\n\nThe convictions and imprisonment of January 6 participants was a hot-button issue in the election with Trump often referring to the defendants as political prisoners.\n\nRhodes and Tarrio were among the most prominent defendants from the riot and had received some of the harshest punishments in what became the largest investigation in the history of the Justice Department.\n\nRhodes' and Tarrio's attorneys confirmed to The Associated Press on Tuesday that they had been released hours after Trump issued pardons, commuted sentences, or ordered the dismissal of cases against all of the more than 1,500 individuals charged with federal crimes in the riot.\n\nFormer head and founder of the Oath Keepers Elmer Stewart Rhodes III was sentenced in 2023 to 18 years for seditious conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding and tampering with documents and proceedings. At the time, Rhodes said he was a \"political prisoner.\"\n\nPrior to January 6, Rhodes posted to the far-right organization's website saying: \"It is CRITICAL that all patriots who can be in D.C. get to D.C. to stand tall in support of President Trump's fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup, through the massive voter fraud and related attacks on our Republic. We Oath Keepers are both honor-bound and eager to be there in strength to do our part.\"\n\nAt his prosecution, federal prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy said: \"Mr. Rhodes led a conspiracy to use force and violence to intimidate and coerce members of our government into stopping the lawful transfer of power following a presidential election. As the court has just found - that is terrorism.\"\n\nTarrio's sentence was passed down by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy J. Kelly in September 2023, following an extensive hearing that included final statements from prosecutors and pleas for leniency from Tarrio's family. The 22-year sentence was notably less than the 33 years sought by the government, but still longer than prison terms given to Tarrio's co-conspirators from his seditious conspiracy trial. Tarrio's sentence is also the harshest given to any defendant in the Capitol riot.\n\nTarrio served in his leadership position with the Proud Boys from 2018 to 2021, seeing the group through a period of time in which, amid the tenure of Trump's first White House run and win, it rose to greater national prominence.\n\nNumerous members of the group were eventually arrested and accused of participating in the Capitol riot, which triggered strife among its ranks. Revelations that Tarrio had acted as an informant for law enforcement in 2012 and 2014 caused further divides in the group. He later stepped down as national chairman of the Proud Boys, but claimed that these divisions were not the reason.\n\nTarrio was not present in Washington, D.C., on the day of the Capitol riot, having been arrested only days prior in connection with a previous incident, and released from jail on the condition that he not enter the district. As the attack unfolded, Tarrio was holed up in a Baltimore hotel room, though prosecutors argued in court that his absence from the siege did \"nothing to detract from the severity of his conduct\" in orchestrating the Proud Boys' involvement in the event, calling him \"a general rather than a soldier,\" a sentiment with which Judge Kelly later concurred.\n\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis told CNN: \"The fact that police officers could potentially be assaulted and there's no consequence, it's pretty straight forward to me...I think it raises a legitimate safety question on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nMarc Caputo, senior politics reporter for Axios, told CNN: \"In the end, Donald Trump had an opportunity to do a lot of work and put in the time, to separate the wheat from the chaff or he could have just done a big blanket thing, a big stroke of the pen. Donald Trump likes these big actions. In the end, that weighed out over these other considerations.\"\n\nAn ongoing list of those who have been pardoned or had their sentences commuted by Trump will soon be released.\n\nMore to follow.\n\nUpdate: 1/21/25, 11:51 a.m.: This article has been updated with more information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSeveral members of the far-right group Proud Boys were found guilty of seditious conspiracy Thursday in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe jury reached a partial verdict in the trial of five Proud Boys members: the group's former leader, Enrique Tarrio, as well as Joseph Biggs , Ethan Nordean, Dominic Pezzola and Zachary Rehl . Each member, except Pezzola, faced nine counts, including seditious conspiracy, a rare charge under a Civil War-era statute, and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. A person convicted on the rarely used seditious conspiracy charge could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors argued that Tarrio was part of the conspiracy because he spent that day at a hotel in Baltimore after being banned from Washington, D.C., on January 5. In an encrypted message shown during the trial, Tarrio acknowledged receiving a message from someone who wanted to \"storm the Capitol,\" but the former Proud Boys leader didn't directly agree with that plan. Prosecutors showed that Tarrio said he wanted a \"spectacle\" on January 6, and celebrated the Capitol riot after it unfolded, crediting the Proud Boys for the attack.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly said the jury reached only a partial verdict and that verdicts on other charges were still being read. The jury is divided on whether Pezzola is guilty of seditious conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding, but Kelly ordered jurors to continue deliberating about multiple charges.\n\nPezzola was found guilty of stealing a police shield that he reportedly used to smash a window during the riot, when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to stop the certification of Joe Biden 's Electoral College victory.\n\nProsecutors argued that the Proud Boys were \"thirsting for violence\" on the day of the riot as they prepared a plan in advance to stop the certification of Biden's win by \"any means necessary, including by force.\"\n\nHowever, attorneys for the defendants said that the Department of Justice was using the Proud Boys as scapegoats for Trump, whom they believe is responsible for the events that day.\n\nThough the other four Proud Boys defendants were acquitted on the charge of assaulting, resisting, and impeding some officers, Pezzola was found guilty of those actions. Rehl denied deploying a can of pepper spray toward officers and wasn't charged with assaulting law enforcement.\n\nJeremy Bertino, a high-ranking member of the Proud Boys, testified as part of a plea deal that the group believed they \"had to do anything that was necessary to save the country.\" Bertino pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in October. He did not attend the Capitol riot but was involved in multiple discussions with other Proud Boys leaders ahead of it.\n\nJury selection for the trial began in December, with opening arguments in January. The trial faced some setbacks over the past few months as the group's defense team filed numerous motions. In March, the trial was halted after the government revealed that one witness scheduled to testify was an informant.\n\nThe trial is the third seditious conspiracy case to go before jurors since the riot. In November and January, several members of another far-right group, Oath Keepers , including founder Stewart Rhodes, also faced seditious conspiracy charges .\n\nIn January, a 12-member jury found members David Moerschel, Joseph Hackett, Roberto Minuta and Edward Vallejo guilty on three conspiracy charges, including seditious conspiracy, as well as obstructing Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election results. In November, Rhodes and another member of the group were found guilty by a jury in a separate trial.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Nicholas Smith, Ethan Nordean's attorney, by email for comment.\n\nUpdate 5/4/23, 1:15 p.m. ET: This story was updated with additional information.\n\nFatma Khaled is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in New York City.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe leader of the North Carolina Chapter of Oath Keepers has pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in the attempt to halt the transfer of power on January 6, 2021, after President Joe Biden won the 2020 election.\n\nSince the attack on the U.S. Capitol last year, nearly 800 people have been arrested in crimes related to the insurrection. William Todd Wilson, 45, of Newton Grove, North Carolina, who is the third Oath Keeper to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy and obstruction, could face up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and up to 20 years for obstruction of an official proceeding, along with financial penalties.\n\nThe Oath Keepers is a large but loosely organized coalition of individuals, mostly former military, law enforcement and first-responders personnel who pledge \"to defend the Constitution.\"\n\nWilson, a military and law enforcement veteran, admitted that he, along with other group members, agreed to participate in a plan to use force to stop the transfer of presidential power. Wilson and others used encrypted and private communications, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons and tactical gear, and were \"prepared to answer a call to take up arms,\" according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nOn January 5, Wilson drove to Washington, D.C., with an AR-15 rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, over 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, pepper spray and a pocketknife, according to court documents.\n\nThe next day, Wilson and others in his group bypassed barricades and Capitol police, making their way into the building. He was the first of the Oath Keeper co-conspirators to breach the Capitol, according to court documents.\n\nEventually, Wilson's group made it to the Rotunda, forced the doors open and went inside. At the time, Wilson was armed with a pocketknife and wore a neck gaiter and beanie hat to conceal his identity.\n\nHe exited the Capitol about 2:55 p.m. and met with other co-conspirators at a restaurant in Virginia. There, a member advised everyone to delete all incriminating materials from their cell phones. Court documents say that when Wilson arrived at his home the next day, he attempted to conceal evidence from his Apple iCloud account. He even threw his cell phone into the Atlantic Ocean to prevent law enforcement from discovering the evidence, the DOJ says.\n\nWilson does not have a sentencing date yet.\n\nThe FBI is continuing to search for individuals who participated in the siege on the Capitol. More than 250 people have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement in the insurrection.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress that was in the process of ascertaining and counting the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHenry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, 39, of Miami, Florida, was sentenced to 22 years in prison and 36 months of supervised release.\n\n\"On January 6th, 2021, the United States Capitol was attacked, 140 law enforcement officers defending those inside were assaulted, and the peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government - a cornerstone of our democracy - was interrupted,\" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \"The Justice Department proved in court that the Proud Boys played a central role in setting the January 6th attack on our Capitol into motion. Over the past week, four members of the Proud Boys received sentences that reflect the danger their crimes pose to our democracy. Today, the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, learned that the consequence of conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power is 22 years in federal prison.\"\n\n\"Today's sentencing demonstrates that those who attempted to undermine the workings of American democracy will be held criminally accountable,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \"The FBI will always protect those who peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights. But we will never condone the actions of those who break our laws, and we will continue to work with federal prosecutors to ensure those perpetrators are held responsible.\"\n\n\"No organization put more boots on the ground at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 than the Proud Boys, and they were at the forefront of every major breach of the Capitol's defenses, leading the on-the-ground efforts to storm the seat of government,\" said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \"The leaders of the Proud Boys and the leaders of the Oath Keepers, who conspired before, during, and after the siege of the Capitol to use force against their own government to prevent the peaceful transfer of power have now been held accountable.\"\n\nOn May 4, 2023, a jury found Tarrio and three other co-defendants of multiple felonies, including seditious conspiracy for their actions before and during the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nPreviously sentenced in this matter were co-defendants Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola. Nordean was sentenced to 18 years in prison, Biggs was sentenced to 17 years, Rehl was sentenced to 15 years, and Pezzola was sentenced to 10 years.\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented during the trial, prior to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, Tarrio created a special chapter of the Proud Boys known as the \"Ministry of Self Defense,\" which included co-defendants Nordean, Biggs, and Rehl, conspired to prevent, hinder and delay the certification of the Electoral College vote and to oppose by force the authority of the government of the United States.\n\nIn the days leading to Jan. 6, 2021, Tarrio and the other leaders of the Ministry of Self Defense hand-selected members of the organization, including co-defendant Dominic Pezzola, to serve as \"rally boys\" during the attack on the Capitol. To prepare for the attack on the Capitol, Tarrio and the other leaders of the Ministry of Self Defense established a chain of command, chose a time and place for their attack, and intentionally recruited others who would follow their top-down leadership and who were prepared to engage in physical violence if necessary.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, the group began their assault that day at 10:00 a.m. when Nordean, Biggs, Rehl, and others marched an assembled group of nearly 200 individuals away from speeches at the Ellipse and directly toward the Capitol. At 2:11 p.m., Pezzola smashed open a window, allowing the first rioters to enter the Capitol as Biggs and those with him entered close behind. Court documents say that Nordean, Biggs and Rehl, and the men they recruited and led, participated in every consequential breach at the Capitol that day.\n\nAs the events of Jan. 6, 2021, unfolded, Tarrio, who was monitoring the attack from afar as it unfolded, posted encouraging messages to his tens of thousands of social media followers, including the following messages: \"Proud of my boys and my country\" and \"Don't f****** leave.\" Tarrio privately claimed credit for the riot at the Capitol, telling Proud Boys senior leadership, \"Make no mistake . . . we did this.\" On Jan. 7, 2021, Tarrio addressed the Ministry of Self Defense members, telling them he was \"proud of y'all.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly found that Tarrio's conduct constituted an official act of terrorism and applied an enhancement to his final sentence.\n\nThe FBI Washington Field Office investigated the case. The charges in the investigation are the result of significant cooperation between agents and staff across numerous FBI Field Offices and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department's National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section, and the Justice Department's Criminal Division's Organized Crime and Gang Section prosecuted the case.\n\nIn the 31 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,106 individuals have been arrested in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 350 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov.\n\nA Kansas City resident, attending college in Boston, was arrested and made his initial court appearance today in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, to face federal charges related to an...\n\nThe Justice Department announced the disruption of an ongoing terrorist financing scheme through the seizure of approximately $201,400 in cryptocurrency held in wallets and accounts intended to benefit Harakat al-Muqawama...\n\nOffice of Public Affairs U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington DC 20530\n\nOffice of Public Affairs Direct Line 202-514-2007\n\nDepartment of Justice Main Switchboard 202-514-2000\n\nSignup for Email Updates Social Media\n\nHave a question about Government Services?"

Worse, the case took liberties with a statute that is probably best forgotten to arrive at its conclusion when normal criminal law could have punished rioters without putting the criminal justice system through contortions.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"A jury in the District of Columbia today returned guilty verdicts on multiple felonies against five members of the Proud Boys, finding four of the defendants guilty of seditious conspiracy for their actions before and during the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021,\" the Department of Justice trumpeted last week. \"According to the evidence at trial, in the months leading up to Jan. 6, the defendants plotted to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power, and to prevent the Members of Congress, and the federal law enforcement officers who protect them, from discharging their duties.\"\n\n\"At my Senate confirmation hearing just over a month after January 6th, I promised that the Justice Department would do everything in its power to hold accountable those responsible for the heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government,\" huffed Attorney General Merrick Garland, a man who gives every impression that he tremendously enjoys the smell of his own emissions. \"Today's verdict is another example of our steadfast commitment to keeping those promises.\"\n\nAnd so, we're told, the republic is safe from those who would rise against it in insurrection. But before we consign former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and codefendants Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, and Zachary Rehl to the history books alongside Mosby and Quantrill , Confederate guerrillas of the sort who inspired the seditious conspiracy statute to begin with, let's consider an important obstacle: There's sparse evidence of a meaningful conspiracy \"to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States\" as required by law.\n\n\"The FBI has found scant evidence that the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was the result of an organized plot to overturn the presidential election result,\" Reuters noted in August 2021. \"'Ninety to ninety-five percent of these are one-off cases,' said a former senior law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. 'Then you have five percent, maybe, of these militia groups that were more closely organized. But there was no grand scheme with Roger Stone and Alex Jones and all of these people to storm the Capitol and take hostages.'\"\n\nThat said, if anybody was among those \"more closely organized,\" it was the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers of the earlier case. But still, prosecutors and the judge had to get creative to arrive at a verdict.\n\n\"The sedition trial...was characterized by frequent delays, frayed relations between the defense and prosecution and several decisions by the presiding judge, Timothy J. Kelly, that tested the boundaries of conspiracy law,\" reported Alan Feuer and Zach Montague for The New York Times . \"Judge Kelly's rulings allowed prosecutors to introduce damning evidence about the violent behavior and aggressive language of members of the Proud Boys who had only limited connections to the five defendants. The rulings also permitted jurors to convict on conspiracy even if they found there was no plan to disrupt the certification of the election, but merely an unspoken agreement to do so.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tarrio was not even in Washington on Jan. 6, having been kicked out of the city days earlier by a local judge presiding over a separate criminal matter,\" they added.\n\n\"The Justice Department's take, of course, fits the narrative favored by Democrats who reflexively describe the Capitol riot as an 'insurrection.'\" Reason 's Jacob Sullum observed . \"But that term implies a level of planning and organization that does not fit the chaotic reality of what happened that day.\"\n\nThere's no easy way to portray the resulting conviction as anything other than a stretch. In fact, less-loaded criminal charges could and did serve to penalize the defendants for their disruptive actions in Washington, D.C., on January 6.\n\n\"The four defendants and co-defendant Dominic Pezzola, 45, of Rochester, New York, were also found guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to prevent Members of Congress and federal law enforcement officers from discharging their duties, civil disorder, and destruction of government property,\" the Justice Department added in its press release. \"Pezzola was also found guilty of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers and robbery involving government property.\"\n\nThese are charges grounded in the defendants' own conduct. They don't require an \"unspoken agreement\" or \"limited connections\" to other people that can tendentiously be converted into a plot against the republic if you squint just right and have a cooperative judge. But destruction of property, impeding Congress, and assaulting police officers, while crimes, don't allow prosecutors and their political allies to portray themselves in heroic terms. Rioters are violent troublemakers, but seditious conspirators can be portrayed as part of a larger movement that intends harm to the whole country.\n\nThe Trump administration floated pulling this same stunt with seditious conspiracy charges (often incorrectly framed as just \"sedition\") against rioters during the civil unrest of the summer of 2020.\n\n\"Attorney General William Barr told the nation's federal prosecutors to be aggressive when charging violent demonstrators with crimes, including potentially prosecuting them for plotting to overthrow the U.S. government,\" The Wall Street Journal 's Aruna Viswanatha and Sadie Gurman reported at the time.\n\n\"Sedition charges require proof of efforts to overthrow the United States Government,\" Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe responded . \"Talking in these terms based on what's happening is grotesquely irresponsible. It's way beyond monarchical. It's paranoid and dictatorial. Opus Dei, anyone?\"\n\nLikewise, the ACLU called Barr's proposed seditious conspiracy prosecutions \"a tyrannical and un-American attempt to suppress our demands for racial justice and an end to police violence.\"\n\nNow the shoe is on the other foot, with a new administration wielding seditious conspiracy charges as weapons against another set of rioters with a different flavor of politics. Again, the rioters' actions would justify prosaic criminal prosecutions if their partisan loyalties weren't at odds with those in power. But why just punish political opponents for bad behavior when you can smear them and their associates as dangers to the nation ?\n\nIn a country as divided as ours, everything becomes a bludgeon against hated others. Politics ruin everything, including the criminal justice system.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

Susan Walsh/AP hide caption\n\nStewart Rhodes, founder of the citizen militia group known as the Oath Keepers, speaks during a rally outside the White House on June 25, 2017.\n\nThe founder of the far-right Oath Keepers group has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for his role in a seditious conspiracy to disrupt the electoral count, the stiffest punishment to date to stem from the violent assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nA jury in Washington, D.C., convicted Stewart Rhodes last November of the politically charged sedition charge and multiple other felonies . Given the rare nature of the charge, his prison term could influence any sentence Enrique Tarrio, the former chairman of the far-right Proud Boys group will face on the same charge later this summer.\n\n\"You, sir, present an ongoing threat and peril to this country ... and to the very fabric of our democracy,\" said U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nFor the first time in a case related to the Jan. 6 attack, Judge Mehta found Rhodes' conduct amounted to terrorism, and factored that into his calculations under the advisory sentencing guidelines.\n\n\"Today's sentences reflect the grave threat the actions of these defendants posed to our democratic institutions,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"The Justice Department will continue to do everything in our power to hold accountable those criminally responsible for the January 6th attack on our democracy.\"\n\nRhodes, a graduate of Yale Law School, pledged to appeal his conviction and sentence. His decision to testify in his own defense last year backfired after prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy drew him out on inconsistencies in his account of his actions leading up to the Capitol siege and his penchant for conspiracy theories.\n\nDuring the trial, the Justice Department presented the jury with thousands of messages from Rhodes and other Oath Keepers before, during and after the events of Jan. 6, including Rhodes' comments that \"we aren't getting through this without a civil war\" and \"the final defense is us and our rifles.\"\n\nUnlike several of his followers and co-defendants, Rhodes never entered the Capitol building, instead presiding over the action like a general on the battlefield, prosecutor Jeffrey Nestler told jurors last year.\n\nEven after the violence that day, and after his arrest, Rhodes repeatedly invoked the prospect of political violence, the judge said. Citing Rhodes' smarts and charisma, Judge Mehta said those same qualities inspired dozens of people to travel to Washington for the electoral count - and what made Rhodes \"dangerous.\"\n\nIn more than 20 minutes of remarks, Rhodes cast himself as a political prisoner and said the experience had been \"surreal,\" likening himself to the protagonist in a Franz Kafka novel. \"I believe this country is incredibly divided and this prosecution...is going to make things worse. I consider every J 6er to be a political prisoner because all of them are grossly overcharged.\"\n\nRhodes, who was interrupted by the judge and asked to wrap up, said his goal in prison is to become \"an American Solzhenitsyn,\" referring to a Soviet dissident who spent time in a labor camp, and \"to expose the criminality of this regime.\"\n\nJudge Mehta rejected Rhodes' bid for leniency and his claims that he had been targeted for political reasons.\n\n\"A seditious conspiracy ... is among the most serious crimes an individual American can commit,\" Mehta said. \"It is an offense against the people of this country.\"\n\nKelly Meggs, a co-defendant also convicted of seditious conspiracy and a former leader of Oath Keepers' Florida chapter, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.  Meggs, in tears, described the separation from his family members, as his attorney Stanley Woodward asked the judge for mercy.\n\nOn Wednesday,  the judge heard emotional accounts from police and congressional staffers who continue to suffer from aftershocks of the assault on their workplace.\n\n\"I used to enjoy coming to work each day proud to be a police officer but the defendants took all that away from me,\" said U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn.\n\nD.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Christopher Owens said his wife burst into tears after seeing his bruised and battered body when he finally returned home on Jan. 7, 2021. \"My physical traumas and bruises have healed but the emotional trauma stays with me to this day,\" Owens said.\n\nTerri McCullough, who served as chief of staff to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the Capitol became a crime scene. \"The defendants violated our work place, our government and our democracy, but they did not succeed, democracy succeeded.\"\n\nThe Justice Department had asked for Rhodes to serve 25 years in prison. Rhodes' legal team, led by Phillip Linder and Lee Bright, requested time served, about a year and a half.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Do These Seditious Conspiracy Convictions Prove the Capitol Riot 'Was Not Spontaneous'?\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nJacob Sullum | 5.5.2023 3:30 PM\n\nA federal jury yesterday convicted four Proud Boys of participating in a seditious conspiracy aimed at keeping Donald Trump in office after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Those verdicts, former federal prosecutor Dennis Aftergut argues in an MSNBC opinion piece, show that the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol was \"an organized, violent uprising meant to overturn the 2020 election.\" According to Aftergut, \"It's now established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Capitol siege was not spontaneous, but rather a planned assault by force on our democracy.\"\n\nThere are a couple of problems with that characterization. First, the prosecutors in this case, who relied heavily on questionable inferences, never showed that the defendants explicitly planned to disrupt congressional certification of Biden's victory. Second, it seems clear that most of the Trump supporters who participated in the riot did act spontaneously , a point that Aftergut glides over.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. As relevant here, it occurs when two or more people conspire to \"oppose by force\" the authority of the U.S. government or \"by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys have a long history of street violence, and they were outraged by Trump's defeat. Members of the group played a conspicuous role in confrontations with police and in breaching the Capitol on the day of the riot. But that does not necessarily mean those acts of violence and vandalism resulted from a seditious plot.\n\nFederal investigators obtained a \"vast amount of evidence,\" including \"more than 500,000 encrypted text messages,\" The New York Times notes . But they \"never found a smoking gun that conclusively showed the Proud Boys plotted to help President Donald J. Trump remain in office.\"\n\nThe star prosecution witness was Jeremy Bertino, a former Proud Boy who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy. The Times notes that he \"repeatedly told investigators that the Proud Boys never had an explicit plan to stop the election certification and that he himself never fully expected violence to erupt on Jan. 6.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Bertino partly repudiated those statements, saying he was trying to \"protect myself and protect everyone else from getting in any trouble.\" He nevertheless reiterated that he had no knowledge of a plan to disrupt the electoral vote count. Rather, he inferred from \"cumulative conversations\" with other Proud Boys that the group would use violence toward that end.\n\n\"It was common knowledge that if everything else failed, there was no other option than to go into a civil war, a revolution,\" Bertino said. \"This was a common topic of conversation in all of the chats I was in.\" According to his testimony, the Times says, \"There were no explicit orders to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6,\" but \"members of the group felt there was an implicit agreement to band together that day and to take the lead in stopping Mr. Biden from entering the White House.\"\n\nProsecutors sought to bolster their case by presenting videos of violent behavior during the riot by Proud Boys who were only tenuously connected to the defendants. The defense strenuously objected to that evidence, saying the government's argument amounted to \"guilt by association.\" The Times describes it as \"a novel legal strategy\" that portrayed the Proud Boys in the videos and other rioters unaffiliated with the group as \"tools\" of the defendants' implicit conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, the jury accepted that argument, convicting former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who did not participate in the riot or attend the rally that preceded it, of seditious conspiracy. They also found Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, and Zachary Rehl guilty of seditious conspiracy while acquitting Dominic Pezzola of that charge.\n\nAll five defendants were found guilty of conspiring to interfere with congressional duties, a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. All but Pezzola were convicted of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nIn addition to the conspiracy counts, all five defendants were found guilty of actually obstructing an official proceeding , which is subject to the same penalties as conspiring to do so, plus civil disorder charges and destruction of government property . Pezzola was convicted of assaulting, resisting, or impeding police officers and robbery of government property .\n\nThe overlapping conspiracy verdicts, which by themselves entail maximum penalties totaling 46 years, present a bit of a puzzle. If Pezzola conspired to interfere with Congress as it ratified Biden's victory, didn't he also conspire to disrupt an official proceeding? And if he participated in a plot to stop legislators from executing their duties under the Electoral Count Act, that seems pretty close to the seditious conspiracy charge, which alleged a plan to \"prevent, hinder, or delay\" the execution of that law.\n\nSimilarly, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes was convicted last November of seditious conspiracy, but he was simultaneously acquitted of conspiring to disrupt an official proceeding and conspiring to interfere with legislators' duties. The seditious conspiracy in which Rhodes participated evidently did not involve the Capitol riot itself, although one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.\n\nLeaving aside the \"novel legal strategy\" that prosecutors used in the Proud Boys case, seditious conspiracy charges are inherently amorphous. On its face, the statute could apply to any protest that includes violence if the government alleges that the organizers intended that result and aimed to interfere with \"the execution of any law of the United States.\" That leaves prosecutors with broad discretion that invites politically motivated charges.\n\nIn prosecuting members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, the Justice Department had a strong incentive to charge seditious conspiracy as a way of demonstrating its seriousness and affixing specific blame for the riot. Attorney General Merrick Garland yesterday emphasized the importance of that particular charge.\n\n\"The evidence presented at trial detailed the extent of the violence at the Capitol on January 6th and the central role these defendants played in setting into motion the unlawful events of that day,\" Garland said in a press release. \"We have now secured the convictions of leaders of both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers for seditious conspiracy-specifically conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power. The Justice Department will never stop working to defend the democracy to which all Americans are entitled.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. likewise declared that \"today's verdict demonstrates the Department's commitment to protecting our institutions of government and holding those who seek to attack them accountable.\" Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen joined Garland in stressing the importance of debunking the idea that the Capitol riot was unplanned. \"This trial pulled back the curtain on a premeditated violent attempt to prevent the peaceful transition of power in America,\" he said. \"The seriousness of today's convictions bring[s] accountability to defendants who attacked our democracy on January 6.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's take, of course, fits the narrative favored by Democrats who reflexively describe the Capitol riot as an \"insurrection.\" But that term implies a level of planning and organization that does not fit the chaotic reality of what happened that day.\n\nThis brings us back to Aftergut, who thinks the seditious conspiracy convictions conclusively prove that the riot \"was not spontaneous.\" But even if you think the Proud Boys deliberately acted as agitators as part of an \"implicit\" plan to violently subvert democracy, most of the people who entered the Capitol grounds and the building itself that day seemed to be acting in the heat of the moment, driven by Trump's stolen election fantasy.\n\nAftergut implicitly admits as much. \"The Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and allied groups were the catalysts for the violence,\" he says. \"The Proud Boys and other groups provoked other, already angry attendees to become the Jan. 6 mob.\"\n\nBut for the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and \"other groups,\" Aftergut seems to be arguing, there would have been no \"Jan. 6 mob.\" That counterfactual supposition seems highly doubtful, especially since Aftergut concedes that the protesters were \"already angry.\" But even in this telling, those angry Trump supporters by and large acted emotionally and impulsively.\n\nAftergut also exaggerates the extent of the violence, inviting us to assume that the rioters shown in the prosecution's videos were typical of the crowd. \"Federal prosecutors have now convicted nearly 500 defendants ['more than 600,' per the DOJ press release] for their roles in the Capitol violence,\" he says. Yet the Capitol riot defendants generally have not been charged with violent crimes.\n\nOf the 1,000 or so defendants who had been charged as of early March, the Times reported , 326 had been charged with \"assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees.\" That group included 106 people who had been \"charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\n\nIn other words, roughly two-thirds of the protesters who had been arrested were charged with nonviolent misdemeanors such as \"entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds,\" \"disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds,\" \"disorderly conduct in a Capitol building,\" and \"parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\" And since the FBI prioritized the most serious and readily provable cases, the nonviolent portion of the entire group probably was larger.\n\nI am not saying those protesters did not break the law or that their crimes do not merit prosecution. But it is highly misleading to suggest that all, or even most, of the January 6 defendants participated in \"the Capitol violence,\" let alone that they did so with the deliberation and intent that the word insurrection suggests.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

You can be punished under state law for conspiring to commit murder or theft or what have you. You can be punished under federal law for conspiring to commit bank robbery, or to defraud the federal government. Likewise, you can be punished under the \"seditious conspiracy\" statute for conspiring to illegally oppose the enforcement of the law.\n\nThis is quite a different statute from the Sedition Act of 1798 (or from the common-law crime of seditious libel), which punished (among other things) false and malicious speech intended to defame the federal government. And to the extent that the seditious conspiracy law punishes agreements to commit crime, which may be expressed by speech, such conspiracy is viewed as constitutionally unprotected, because it is speech integral to the criminal conduct that is being planned .

      "text": "Stewart Rhodes Gets 18 Years After the DOJ Reiterates a Conspiracy Claim That Jurors Rejected\n\nCapitol Riot\n\nJacob Sullum | 5.29.2023 3:25 PM\n\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., last week sentenced Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding, and tampering with records. The New York Times says Rhodes was sentenced for \"the role he played in helping to mobilize the pro-Trump attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\" It adds that the sentence is \"the most severe penalty so far in the more than 1,000 criminal cases stemming from the Capitol attack.\"\n\nContrary to that gloss, Rhodes' role in the breach of the Capitol, which forced a delay in the congressional ratification of President Joe Biden's election, remains unclear. Rhodes was at the Capitol grounds that day, and during his trial a federal prosecutor described him as \"a general surveying his troops on the battlefield.\" But unlike other members of his group, he did not enter the Capitol or participate in the violence or vandalism. Notably, the jury found him not guilty of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, a puzzling verdict if he did in fact direct his followers to assault the Capitol.\n\nThe Justice Department's sentencing memo , which recommended a 25-year sentence for Rhodes, said he and other Oath Keepers \"led a conspiracy that culminated in a mob's attack on the United States Capitol while our elected representatives met in a Joint Session of Congress.\" It also said Rhodes \"led a conspiracy to oppose by force the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" a vaguer description that better fits the facts that the jury accepted.\n\nProsecutors urged U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta to take into account acquitted conduct in punishing Rhodes, as federal sentencing rules allow , and hold him responsible for the actions of his co-conspirators. They also recommended a sentencing enhancement based on \"terrorism,\" defined as conduct \"calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\" Although Rhodes \"did not engage in violence,\" the Justice Department said, his rhetoric inspired others to do so.\n\nBased on evidence cited in the sentencing memo, it is clear that Rhodes saw violence as a legitimate response to what he perceived as a stolen election. \"We're very much in exactly the same spot that the founding fathers were in like March 1775,\" he said during a conference call after the election. \"Patrick Henry was right. Nothing left but to fight. And that's true for us, too. We're not getting out of this without a fight.\"\n\nRhodes was more explicit a December 14 open letter to Donald Trump that was posted on the Oath Keepers website. \"If you fail to act while you are still in office,\" he wrote, \"we the people will have to fight a bloody civil war and revolution.\"\n\nRhodes reiterated that sentiment in chat group messages that day. \"Trump has one last chance to act,\" he said. \"He must use the insurrection act. Unless we fight a bloody civil war/revolution.\"\n\nIn Rhodes' fantasy, the Oath Keepers would rise up after Trump invoked the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to call upon \"the militia\" to suppress \"any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy\" that \"opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\" If Trump \"doesn't use the Insurrection Act to keep a ChiCom [Chinese Communist] puppet out of the White House,\" Rhodes warned, \"we will have to fight a bloody revolution/civil war to defeat the traitors.\"\n\nIn a December 19 exchange with a member of the Proud Boys, Oath Keeper Roberto Minuta described Rhodes as \"pretty disheartened.\" Based on a conversation with Rhodes the previous night, Minuta added that \"he feels like it's go time\" and that \"the time for peaceful protest is over in his eyes.\"\n\nIn a series of messages to an Oath Keepers chat group on December 25, Rhodes complained that Trump's advisers were \"acting as if his only option is to hope Congress does the right thing.\" He said that was \"extremely unlikely,\" adding, \"I think Congress will screw him over. The only chance we/he has is if we scare the shit out of them and convince them it will be torches and pitchforks time is they don't do the right thing.\"\n\nSuch rhetoric was not enough to persuade jurors that Rhodes specifically planned the attack on the Capitol. In arguing that Mehta nevertheless should assume that Rhodes did have such a plan, the Justice Department noted that he had described January 6 as a \"hard constitutional deadline,\" which it said confirmed \"the group's knowledge of Congress's process for certifying the election results\" and \"improper purpose in later breaching the Capitol building.\"\n\nThe sentencing memo also cited a 90-second phone call between Rhodes and Meggs before the latter led a group of Oath Keepers who pushed their way into the Capitol. Although the content of that conversation is unknown, the Justice Department said, witnesses \"testified that Meggs appeared to be receiving direction from whomever he was talking to on the phone.\" Again, the jury did not view that inference, even when combined with Rhodes' violent rhetoric, as sufficient to find him guilty of conspiring to attack the Capitol.\n\nWhat about the \"quick reaction force\" (QRF) that stockpiled weapons at a Comfort Inn in Arlington, Virginia, prior to the riot? The sentencing memo noted that Rhodes \"claimed he was unaware that there was a QRF for January 6,\" saying he knew that Oath Keeper Edward Vallejo had stashed guns at the hotel but \"did not know that there was anybody sitting on them to do anything with them.\" In a message introduced at trial, however, Rhodes agreed with Meggs that a QRF was appropriate. \"Okay,\" he said. \"We will have a QRF. The situation calls for it.\"\n\nThe QRF ultimately did not do anything. But what did Rhodes think its purpose was? Oath Keeper Michael Greene, who in March was found guilty of a misdemeanor in connection with the Capitol riot, testified that Rhodes \"wanted an armed QRF in Virginia because he heard people talking about they were going to forcefully storm the White House and remove Trump because Trump was refusing to leave the White House.\" According to the sentencing memo, Rhodes \"instructed his co-conspirators to be prepared, if necessary, to secure the White House and use force against any government actors attempting to remove President Trump as a result of the presidential election.\"\n\nRhodes manifestly was ready to violently oppose the peaceful transfer of power, and he took steps in that direction, including the QRF and weapon purchases after the Capitol riot. That conduct, the jury evidently concluded, fit comfortably within the legal definition of seditious conspiracy, which includes plots to forcefully oppose the authority of the U.S. government or hinder the execution of its laws. But that conspiracy did not necessarily entail a plan to violently disrupt the electoral vote count on January 6. On that charge, the jury deemed the evidence insufficient to convict Rhodes.\n\nThe jury \"made the confusing decision to acquit Mr. Rhodes of planning in advance to disrupt the certification of the election yet convict him of actually disrupting the certification process,\" the Times reported after the verdicts. \"That suggested that the jurors may have believed that the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 erupted more or less spontaneously, as Mr. Rhodes has claimed.\"\n\nWhatever you make of Rhodes' intent, it seems clear that the violence, by and large, did erupt \"more or less spontaneously.\" According to the Justice Department, the Oath Keepers conspiracy involved 20 or so people. A handful of Proud Boys also were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nThese relatively organized rioters represented a tiny fraction of the angry Trump supporters who trespassed on the Capitol grounds or entered the building itself. The 1,000 or so who have been arrested so far typically have been charged with misdemeanors such as \"entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds,\" \"disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds,\" \"disorderly conduct in a Capitol building,\" and \"parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.\" Roughly a third have been charged with violent crimes, and only a few have been accused of acting based on plans hatched prior to January 6.\n\nWhen the Justice Department says Rhodes \"led a conspiracy that culminated in a mob's attack on the United States Capitol,\" it is not only making an allegation that jurors rejected. It is implying that, but for that conspiracy, there would have been no Capitol riot. Given the emotional energy unleashed by Trump's pre-riot speech, that counterfactual supposition seems highly implausible. But it fits the narrative favored by Democrats who reflexively portray the riot as an \"insurrection,\" which implies a level of planning and organization that does not reflect the chaotic reality of what happened that day.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Sedition Charges Are Almost Always a Terrible Idea\n\nJanuary 6\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 1.11.2021 10:45 AM\n\nIn the wake of the January 6 storming of the Capitol, a popular new word in common usage is \"sedition.\" Horrified onlookers - and conniving power brokers - urge charging the participants and those who egged them on with \" seditious conspiracy \" under laws with a nasty history of politicized mischief. As such, \"sedition\" joins the recently popular \"treason\" on the list of overused and emotionally charged vocabulary terms with dangerous implications.\n\n\"For at least some of these protesters, particularly the ones that broke into the Capitol, I think there's an extraordinarily strong case that they used force to delay, to hinder, the execution of our laws governing the election and how electoral votes are counted,\" Professor Devin Schindler of Western Michigan University's Cooley Law School told the Detroit Free Press . \"It seems fairly clear to me, based on what we're seeing, that folks are in fact, almost textbook violating this seditious conspiracy statute by using force to interfere with lawful government activity.\"\n\nIn his analysis, Schindler echoed earlier comments by former Attorney General William Barr. According to the Wall Street Journal , Barr \"told the nation's federal prosecutors to be aggressive when charging violent demonstrators with crimes, including potentially prosecuting them for plotting to overthrow the U.S. government... He encouraged the prosecutors to seek a number federal charges, including under a rarely used sedition law, even when state charges could apply, the people said.\"\n\nOf course, Barr spoke back in September, when riots consumed parts of many American cities. While out of office by the time of the violence at the Capitol, he called it \"outrageous and despicable\" and said, \"federal agencies should move immediately to disperse it.\" He did not, it seems, again invoke the prospect of \"sedition\" charges. Perhaps he realized that the bar for proving sedition is - rightfully - very high in courtrooms that are generally protective of free speech rights.\n\nAt the time of Barr's comments, former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade - who oversaw a rare (and unsuccessful) sedition prosecution in 2012 - said that prosecutors face challenges when dealing with allegations of ideologically motivated activity. \"You can't penalize people for First Amendment activity, but it leaves fewer tools when you have a group plotting an attack of some sort,\" she told the Wall Street Journal .\n\nIt's become very difficult in the United States to bring sedition charges because courts are all too aware of their record as dangerous weapons in the hands of insecure politicians.\n\n\"It's the sort of crime that weak governments enforce against their citizens when the government is facing an existential threat - or thinks it is,\" Harvard Law School's Noah Feldman pointed out in September:\n\nSedition prosecutions in the U.S. have a particularly shameful history. The 1798 Sedition Act was used in a nakedly partisan manner by John Adams's Federalist administration to prosecute Republican newspaper editors... The Sedition Act of 1918 was not much better. Passed under conditions of wartime hysteria, it was used to prosecute more than 2,000 people, most of whom spoke against World War I.\n\nThe weaponization of law against speech disliked by powerful people has prompted landmark free speech decisions. \"The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action,\" the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969).\n\nFeldman originally discussed sedition with regard to protesters against police brutality and racial injustice, but he returned to the issue after the violence at the Capitol.\n\n\"From the standpoint of hard statutory language, it would be very difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct that we observed counted as sedition under the law,\" he said of the Trumpist participants. Of Trump himself, Feldman commented:\n\nHe's calling for a protest march on the Capitol and that's perfectly lawful and constitutionally protected, in fact. Similarly, when the president spoke later and told his supporters to go home while telling them that he loved them and that the election was being stolen, he was pretty careful not to use words that directed imminent lawless action.\n\nThat's not to say that the people who violently stormed the Capitol, attacked people (and killed a policeman), and damaged property are blameless or that Trump should get a free pass. But there are other legal means for addressing bad behavior than dusting off statutes that, historically, are best known for their use by powerful government officials to crush enemies and silence dissent. People flinging the word \"sedition\" around now raise credible concerns that their motivations are no better than those that drove prosecutions under the charge in the past.\n\nIn its unfortunate reintroduction to American discourse, \"sedition\" resembled \"treason,\" a word that in recent years has become an increasingly popular term for smearing anybody with opposing viewpoints. While specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution as levying war against the United States or \"adhering to their enemies,\" it's been used to label people \"guilty\" of nothing more than supporting opposition political candidates or of refusing to applaud a speech .\n\nGiven that treason potentially carries the death penalty, it's a particularly inappropriate epithet to fling at people whose politics you dislike. Sedition \"only\" carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, but that is a brutal consequence to dangle over people for supposedly violating a law that has historically been used by the powerful against their critics.\n\nIf sedition is the sort of crime that weak governments enforce against their citizens, the new popularity of the accusation, along with that of treason, might well be an indicator of the decayed nature of our political institutions. With Americans holding high contempt for one another and nearly record low trust in government - one-in-five voters in a January 6 YouGov poll even supported the storming of the Capitol - it's easy to see how insecure politicians and members of the pundit class could seek strength in outrageous charges and draconian penalties.\n\nBut bogus charges and suppression of speech - whether that speech is wise or intemperate - won't reinforce shaky institutions. If people horrified by the events of January 6 want to prevent a recurrence, they can best do so not by resorting to a disreputable legal weapon, but by convincing all sorts of Americans that their freedom and security can be maintained under the existing system. That means that, so long as they respect the rights of others, the system will leave them alone , and not be used to crush them.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

Adler | 1.7.2021 9:14 AM\n\nIn September, then-Deputy Attorney General said the Department of Justice should consider filing seditious conspiracy charges against rioters and violent protestors who attacked federal buildings or federal agents during protests in multiple U.S. cities. From the New York Times report :\n\nThe deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, said in an email to federal prosecutors that they should consider use of the sedition statute and other federal laws to try to stop violence at protests this summer - even in instances where local law enforcement would typically bring charges. . . .\n\n\"The attorney general and I recently discussed with you the need to consider the use of a variety of federal charges when they may be appropriate, including seditious conspiracy,\" Mr. Rosen wrote.\n\nTheir push for prosecutors to consider sedition was proper and that prosecutors did not need evidence of a plot to overthrow the government to consider and bring charges under the statute, \"despite what the name might suggest,\" Mr. Rosen wrote. . . .\n\n\"Critics of the inclusion of Section 2384 in a list of available statutes appear not to have read beyond the section's title,\" Mr. Rosen wrote, citing the portion of the federal code containing the law. \"Those who have actually read the statute recognize that the text of Section 2384 could potentially apply to some of the violent acts that have occurred.\"\n\nAs I noted yesterday , Rosen (who is now Acting Attorney General) is correct about the scope of Section 2384. Further, the text of this provision would seem to be no less applicable to some of yesterday's events than to some of 2020's riots and assaults on federal buildings.\n\nWill the Justice Department pursue such charges against those who organized, encouraged, and participated in storming the nation's Capitol? In a statement yesterday , Acting AG Rosen said \"The violence at our Nation's Capitol Building is an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy.\" If so, it would seem Section 2384 should apply to at least some of the individuals involved.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Oath Keepers Face Trial This Week for Seditious Conspiracy in January 6 Plot\n\nThe case will be the first for seditious conspiracy in 10 years: A Dispatch Explainer.\n\nOath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes and four co-defendants will become the first Americans in a decade tried for seditious conspiracy when their trial begins Tuesday. All were charged days after the January 6 Capitol insurrection.\n\nFederal prosecutors accuse Rhodes and his co-defendants of conspiring to \"oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power\" when they participated in the attack. Starting in December 2020, Rhodes and other Oath Keepers allegedly \"coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, D.C., equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear,\" on January 6, according to prosecutors.\n\nWhat is seditious conspiracy ?\n\nIt occurs when two or more people \"conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof.\" Seditious conspiracy is punishable with up to 20 years in prison and a potential fine.\n\nThe law was enacted in 1862 as part of the Second Confiscation Act , which states that \"if any person shall hereafter incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States,\" they would be punished with a possible fine and up to a 10-year sentence.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is a subset of conspiracy-the crime of working with someone else to commit a crime. Proving conspiracy requires several elements, according to Sarah Ludington, Duke University law professor: an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime and taking substantial acts to do so.\n\nSeditious conspiracy is \"acting for the purpose of preventing the government from enforcing the law as a government,\" Alan Rozenshtein, University of Minnesota Law School professor and former Justice Department official, said.\n\nWhy are Rhodes and his co-defendants being accused of seditious conspiracy?\n\nThe Oath Keepers believe that the federal government has been \"coopted by a cabal of elites actively trying to strip American citizens of their rights,\" according to the indictment. The militia group , founded in 2009, will accept anyone as members but focuses specifically on recruiting former and current military and law enforcement personnel.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Rhodes and his co-defendants planned to use force to \"prevent, hinder, or delay\" the certification of the Electoral College vote.\n\nAs outlined by the Justice Department , Rhodes and his co-defendants allegedly:\n\n\"conspired through a variety of manners and means, including: organizing into teams that were prepared and willing to use force and to transport firearms and ammunition into Washington, D.C.; recruiting members and affiliates to participate in the conspiracy; organizing trainings to teach and learn paramilitary combat tactics; bringing and contributing paramilitary gear, weapons and supplies - including knives, batons, camouflaged combat uniforms, tactical vests with plates, helmets, eye protection and radio equipment - to the Capitol grounds; breaching and attempting to take control of the Capitol grounds and building on Jan. 6, 2021, in an effort to prevent, hinder and delay the certification of the electoral college vote ...\"\n\nThe 48-page indictment outlines how Rhodes allegedly sent messages to his followers via the encrypted messaging app Signal, encouraging them to refuse the results of the election. \"We aren't getting through this without a civil war,\" Rhodes said in a November 5, 2020, message. \"Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit.\"\n\nJury selection will begin on Tuesday, and the trial is expected to last about five weeks.\n\nAccording to Roger Parloff, senior editor at Lawfare , one complicating issue in this case is that Rhodes and his lawyers claimed that he had hoped that Donald Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act , which gives the president the authority to use the military in cases of \"extreme civil disturbance.\"\n\n\"So, all the conspiring to do that [stockpiling weapons] was not a crime in their view,\" Parloff said. \"This was a contingency plan.\"\n\nThe government will contest that this gives Rhodes and the other defendants cover for their actions.\n\nThe last conviction for seditious conspiracy in a high-profile case came in 1995, when Omar Abdel Rahman , the \"Blind Sheikh,\" and his co-conspirators were convicted in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n\nIn 1954 four Puerto Rican nationalists stormed into the Capitol and shot five congressmen. As Lawfare documented, the Justice Department charged all four and 13 additional members of the group with seditious conspiracy. (Four pleaded guilty and 13 were convicted at trial ).\n\nThe most recent (and also unsuccessful) seditious conspiracy trial came 10 years ago. The militia group known as the Hutaree militia was accused of inciting an uprising against the government, and several of its members were charged in 2010. At the 2012 trial, a judge ordered acquittals on the seditious conspiracy charges, \"saying prosecutors relied too much on hateful diatribes protected by the First Amendment and didn't, as required, prove the accused ever had detailed plans for a rebellion,\" reported the Associated Press .\n\nIt is impossible to predict what the outcome of this upcoming trial will be. \"I think the stakes are quite high,\" Parloff said, adding acquittals would be an embarrassment for the government. \"Politically it would be a huge humiliation for [United States Attorney General] Merrick Garland Justice Department.\"\n\nKhaya Himmelman is a fact checker for The Dispatch.

      "text": "Assessing Trump's Latest Claims About the January 6 Capitol Attack\n\nThe president-elect made a series of misleading and false claims during his Tuesday press conference.\n\nDuring a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump made several misleading and incorrect statements related to the events of January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building after a rally. These include claiming that some people who participated in January 6-related events \"came from the FBI,\" that some January 6 participants were imprisoned despite having never entered the Capitol building that day, that there \"wasn't one gun found\" by protesters on January 6, and that the FBI knows the identity of the unidentified suspect who placed pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington on January 5.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump would pardon January 6 offenders charged with violent crimes, the president-elect responded by making claims about the FBI's involvement. \"I guess 24 or 28 people came now from the FBI-that came out very quietly,\" Trump said. \"Nobody reported it, but they had people in some form related to the FBI. They had four or five people that were strongly related to the FBI. We have to find out about that.\"\n\nThis claim is missing context. Trump is referencing a December 12 report from the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General that found there were 26 FBI confidential human informants at the Capitol riot on January 6, but no undercover agents or other FBI employees. Because the \"Stop the Steal\" protests that preceded the Capitol attack were \"First Amendment-protected events,\" FBI policy did not allow any undercover agents to be stationed within the raucous crowds. Some FBI agents pushed to send in undercover agents to investigate the various protest rallies on January 6, but their requests were rejected: One FBI field office requested authorization for undercover agents to \"engage in investigative authority on January 6,\" but was denied by a high-ranking agent in the bureau's Washington, D.C., field office, per the report.\n\nInstead, the FBI sent confidential human informants-people who voluntarily feed information to the FBI but don't work for the agency in any official capacity-to report on the January 6 events from within the crowd. As The Dispatch Fact Check previously reported on the difference between FBI informants and undercover agents:\n\nConfidential human sources are not FBI employees-they have not gone through formal FBI agent training and, while some are paid for their services, are not salaried employees in the federal intelligence agency.\n\n...\n\nSigning up to be a FBI confidential informant is not as simple as volunteering for a local soup kitchen. Informants must first pass a standardized \"validation\" process, which requires an FBI agent to collect personal information, including their identity, prior criminal history, and potential motivations for becoming an informant. If approved, informants must attest that information they give is truthful, shared voluntarily, and that they will \"not take or seek to take any independent action on behalf of the United States Government.\"\n\nFBI informants also do not possess any investigative or law enforcement authority-they cannot make any arrests, search any person or vehicle without their permission, or engage in any illegal activity. Still, 17 FBI informants did commit a federal crime by trespassing on Capitol grounds on January 6-13 of whom entered the restricted security perimeter and four who entered the Capitol building. However, as the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington, D.C., explained in the report, the office did not charge any FBI informants for illegally entering Capitol grounds because it has \"generally not charged\" January 6 participants for whom that was their only offense. Those who participated in the January 6 events but committed no crime apart from entering the Capitol security perimeter faced no greater legal consequences than the FBI informants who did the same-they were never charged.\n\nWhile it is unclear what Trump meant by \"four or five people that were strongly related to the FBI,\" the report noted that two of the 26 FBI informants were instructed by their FBI field office to travel to Washington on January 6, and three were specifically tasked to report on \"domestic terrorism subjects who were possibly attending the event.\" One was tasked to report on a domestic terrorist suspect who traveled to D.C. for Congress' certification of the 2020 presidential electors, a second was tasked to report on two suspects who traveled to D.C. for the January 6 protest rally, and a third informant traveled to D.C. on his own volition and, upon telling his FBI contact that he planned to be in D.C. on January 6, was tasked to \"potentially report\" on two other suspects who had also traveled to the city.\n\nTrump also claimed that some of those imprisoned for January 6-related charges did not enter the Capitol building. \"People that were doing some bad things weren't prosecuted, and people that didn't even walk into the building are in jail right now,\" Trump said. \"So we'll be looking at the whole thing, but I'll be making major pardons.\"\n\nTrump is correct that several January 6 participants who did not enter the Capitol building are currently imprisoned for their actions that day, but his claim is missing crucial context-mainly, that they were convicted for crimes more serious than entering the Capitol building.\n\nFor example, Stewart Rhodes-leader of the Oath Keepers, a radical militant group-received an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to January 6. Rhodes entered the security perimeter surrounding the Capitol during the attack, but did not enter the Capitol building itself because he was \"directing and coordinating activities\" for his followers, per the DOJ. Nearly two months before January 6, Rhodes drafted a plan to use force to block the peaceful transition of power and encouraged others to participate. In the week leading up to January 6, Rhodes spent a total of $15,500 on firearms and related equipment and accessories on four separate occasions. Shortly after violence broke out at the Capitol, Rhodes entered the security perimeter and urged his followers to follow suit. During the Capitol assault, Rhodes was in direct communication with Oath Keepers who had breached the building. \"He was the one giving the orders,\" said U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta , who sentenced Rhodes to prison. \"Oath Keepers wouldn't have been there [Washington D.C.] but for Stewart Rhodes, I don't think anyone contends otherwise. He was the one who gave the order to go, and they went.\"\n\nSimilarly, Enrique Tarrio-the former national chairman of the Proud Boys, a far-right militant group-received a 22-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy despite not entering the Capitol building. But, as with Rhodes, Tarrio hands were not clean: After the 2020 election, he created a new Proud Boys chapter made up of hand-picked \"rally boys,\" established a leadership structure within the group, and planned a \"DC trip\" where he instructed members to dress \"incognito.\" Ultimately, Tarrio was arrested two days before January 6 for burning a Black Lives Matter flag and illegally possessing ammunition, and was given a court order to leave the city until required to appear in court months later. But on January 6, Tarrio was \"monitoring the attack from afar,\" according to the DOJ. \"Make no mistake ... we did this,\" Tarrio told other Proud Boys leaders during the Capitol attack, while also posting to social media, \"Don't f-ing leave.\" \"Mr. Tarrio was the ultimate leader, the ultimate person who organized, who was motivated by revolutionary zeal,\" said U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly , who issued Tarrio's sentencing. \"That conspiracy ended up with about 200 men amped up for battle encircling the Capitol.\"\n\nLater in the press conference, Trump was asked whether he'd consider pardoning January 6 offenders charged with attacking police officers. In his response, Trump emphasized that \"people went in ... with not one gun.\"\n\n\"There was never charges of insurrection or anything like that. But if there were, this would be the only insurrection in history where people went in as insurrectionists with not one gun. Okay?\" Trump said. \"And let me tell you, the people that you're talking about have a lot of guns in their home: for hunting, and for shooting, and for entertainment, a lot of good reasons, but there wasn't one gun that they found.\"\n\nThe claim that January 6 protesters did not carry guns to the Capitol is false. Several individuals have been convicted on federal and local firearms offense charges, including those who brought their guns onto or near Capitol grounds.\n\nA few examples:\n\nMark Mazza was sentenced to 60 months in prison for bringing two loaded guns onto Capitol grounds, and for assaulting a police officer. On January 6, Mazza entered Capitol grounds and accidentally lost one of his guns, a Taurus revolver loaded with shotgun shells and hollow-point bullets. His other firearm was a loaded semiautomatic pistol. Mazza proceeded inside the Capitol building, where he attacked law enforcement officers with a stolen police baton. Two days after January 6, Mazza filed a police report in Indiana, where he falsely claimed to have lost his revolver in an Ohio casino.\n\nChristopher Alberts was given a prison sentence of 84 months for a series of felony offenses that included bringing a loaded 9 mm firearm and ammunition in the Capitol. He wasn't found to have used the gun during the attack, instead using a wooden pallet to assault police officers. Law enforcement later that night arrested Alberts, who had remained on Capitol grounds.\n\nGuy Reffit received a 87-month prison sentence on several January 6-related charges, and also brought a loaded gun onto Capitol grounds. Per the DOJ, on the morning of January 6, Reffit carried a handgun and flexi-cuffs (zip-ties) to the White House Ellipse and later that day went to the Capitol. Reffit-a member of a radical militia group the Texas Three Percenters-told fellow members and other January 6 participants that day \"that he planned to physically drag Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi out of the Capitol Building by her ankles,\" per the DOJ. Although he never entered the Capitol building, he led rioters up the steps to the Capitol and bragged about it. \"I didn't make it in there,\" he said in a self-recorded video. \"But I started the fire.\"\n\nLonnie Coffman was sentenced to 46 months after law enforcement on January 6 found his pickup truck-parked less than half-a-mile from the Capitol building-was stashed with a variety of weapons. According to the DOJ, his truck contained \"several loaded firearms within arms-reach of the driver's seat, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun, and a cooler containing 11 mason jars filled with ignitable ingredients for Molotov cocktail incendiary weapons.\" Coffman was also found to have brought two firearms-a handgun and revolver, both loaded-to the area around the Stop the Steal rally, but was not charged with bringing firearms onto Capitol grounds specifically.\n\nAfter Trump claimed no guns were found during January 6, he falsely claimed in the same response that the FBI knows the identity of the person suspected of placing pipe bombs outside high-profile political sites in Washington.\n\n\"And why didn't they find the bomber, the pipe bomber. You know, they know who the pipe bomber is. The FBI knows who it is,\" Trump said. \"The status of the FBI has gone down so far, and the status of the DOJ, or as I call it, the Department of injustice.\"\n\nTrump is referencing a failed domestic terror plot from January 5, 2021, in which an unknown individual placed a pipe bomb in two Washington, D.C., locations: one at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, and the other at the Republican National Committee headquarters. Claims that the suspect's identity is known to the FBI or other law enforcement are baseless and lack evidence. And the FBI isn't the only law enforcement agency investigating the pipe bomber-the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department; and the U.S. Capitol Police Department also have been involved in the search for the suspect. Images the FBI obtained of the suspect the same day he placed the pipe bombs indicate he carried a backpack and \"wore a face mask, glasses, gloves, a grey hooded sweatshirt, and black and light grey Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo.\" The FBI has continued to offer up to $500,000 for tips leading to the would-be terrorist's identity. On January 2, 2025, the FBI shared \"previously unreleased\" footage of the suspect placing the pipe bomb outside DNC headquarters, again asking people to pass along any relevant information they may have.\n\nAs a previous Dispatch Fact Check explained about false claims regarding the pipe bomber's identity:\n\nWho placed the explosives there remains one of the biggest mysteries surrounding January 6 despite a three-year investigation and a $500,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The FBI believes the pipe bombs were planted near the two buildings by a lone individual on the night of January 5, 2021, but authorities remain uncertain of an exact motive. In a June 2023 House Judiciary Committee hearing, Steven D'Antuono , former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office, testified that lab analysis determined the bombs were viable and could have exploded.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Viral Claims Distort Findings of the DOJ's January 6 Report\n\nThe report found that the FBI had confidential sources but no agents at the Capitol riot.\n\nIn the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, claims emerged that the violence was instigated not by supporters of Donald Trump but by Antifa agitators or even government agents. For example, in his documentary Patriot Purge , former Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that federal agents played a formative role in the riots. \"Direct incitement by federal agents? The intentional entrapment of American citizens? No decent person wants to believe that,\" he said, as PolitiFact noted at the time. \"But increasingly there's evidence it is true.\"\n\nAccording to a Washington Post -University of Maryland poll released earlier this year, 25 percent of Americans believed it was \"definitely\" or \"probably true\" that \"FBI operatives had organized and encouraged\" the January 6 Capitol attack, with a further 26 percent saying they were \"not sure\" about the claim's merit. Less than half of Americans said this theory was \"definitely\" or \"probably false.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) released a new report December 12 examining the FBI's role in the leadup and aftermath of the January 6 riots. The report, released from the DOJ's office of the inspector general, found that while 26 FBI confidential informants were in Washington, D.C., the day of the Capitol attack, there were no undercover FBI agents at the \"Stop the Steal!\" rallies, the breaching of the Capitol building, or within any other protesting crowds on January 6.\n\nSome posts shared online incorrectly summarize those findings.\n\n\"Literally everything you've been told about January 6th is a lie,\" tweeted Liz Wheeler, a right-wing influencer and podcaster. \"The truth: It wasn't an insurrection. Protesters didn't have illegal weapons. It wasn't 'coordinated'-except by Feds. 26 undercover FBI sources entered the Capitol & restricted areas.\" Another prominent X account with nearly 250,000 followers similarly claimed , \"The IG report just released admits to at least 26 undercover FBI operatives involved on J6.\"\n\nThese claims are partly false. While the FBI had 26 \"confidential human sources\" at January 6-related events, such sources were there of their own accord and FBI policy forbade them from engaging in any illegal activity.\n\nThe report found no evidence that any undercover FBI agents were at the Capitol or other protest sites on January 6. \"FBI policy does not permit the FBI to have undercover employees in crowds at First Amendment-protected events absent some investigative authority,\" the report stated. In fact, one senior FBI agent in the agency's Washington field office told the inspector general he denied another FBI office's request to have undercover agents \"engage in investigative activity on January 6.\"\n\nConfidential human sources are not FBI employees-they have not gone through formal FBI agent training and, while some are paid for their services, are not salaried employees in the federal intelligence agency.\n\nAccording to the U.S. attorney general's official guidelines , confidential human sources include \"any individual who is believed to be providing useful and credible information to the FBI for any authorized information collection activity, and from whom the FBI expects or intends to obtain additional useful and credible information in the future, and whose identity, information, or relationship with the FBI warrants confidential handling.\" The FBI is tasked with recording payments made to various confidential informants, though receipts are not made publicly available, so specific payment amounts and informant identities remain confidential.\n\nSigning up to be a FBI confidential informant is not as simple as volunteering for a local soup kitchen. Informants must first pass a standardized \"validation\" process, which requires an FBI agent to collect personal information, including their identity, prior criminal history, and potential motivations for becoming an informant. If approved, informants must attest that information they give is truthful, shared voluntarily, and that they will \"not take or seek to take any independent action on behalf of the United States Government.\"\n\nThe FBI often relies on confidential informants when the agency is trying to gauge information, but lacks first-hand accounts and critical details. \"[Confidential human sources] can play a crucial role in DOJ law enforcement, including the FBl's efforts to combat crime and protect national security,\" the DOJ report stated. They \"provide the FBI with information and insights about the inner workings of criminal, terrorist, and espionage networks that otherwise would be unavailable.\"\n\nThe report found that 26 confidential FBI informants were present in Washington on January 6. Three informants traveled there to report on the activity of specific suspects, while the 23 other informants were in the city \"in connection with the events planned for January 6.\"\n\nThe FBI said its informants were not allowed to engage in any illegal behavior, even if the suspects they were following participated in the unlawful Capitol attack. \"None of these FBI [confidential human sources] were authorized to enter the Capitol or a restricted area, or to otherwise break the law on January 6,\" the report stated, \"nor was any [confidential human sources] directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6.\" However, of the 26 FBI informants, 13 illegally entered the Capitol security perimeter, while an additional four went inside the Capitol building. None have been prosecuted to date.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., explained it is not giving the FBI informants special legal privileges. Rather, the office said it has generally abstained from prosecuting January 6 participants whose only offense was illegally entering the restricted Capitol area. \"The D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office generally has not charged those individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals,\" the office said in the report. \"We have treated the [confidential human sources] consistent with this approach.\"\n\nIn October 2021, the New York Times reported that two FBI informants-members in separate chapters of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group-had entered the Capitol building during the riots, based on confidential records the outlet obtained. The Times reported that an FBI agent communicating with one of the informants \"appeared not to grasp that the building had been breached, the records show, and asked the informant to keep him in the loop-especially if there was any violence.\" The second informant reportedly debated whether or not to enter the Capitol building with fellow Proud Boys members. When they entered, the informant followed inside, but reportedly did not engage in any violence, destruction, or vandalism. \"The records say that he hurt no one and broke nothing,\" the Times reported, adding the informant swiftly left the Capitol through a window upon hearing from police officers that shots were fired in the building.\n\nNonetheless, the report states that FBI informants relayed critical information relevant to the January 6 events. \"The [Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General] determined that many of these 26 [confidential human sources] had provided information relevant to the January 6 Electoral Certification before the event and that a few [confidential human sources] also provided information about the riot as it occurred.\"\n\nThese include warnings that the Oath Keepers-a far-right militia group present in Washington on January 6-had more than 200 members traveling to D.C. and \"may become involved in unplanned violent activity,\" and additional warnings regarding travel plans of the Proud Boys. The FBI had informants \"in more than one field office\" that were reporting on Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers' leader who was later sentenced to 18 years in federal prison on charges including seditious conspiracy.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "The Morning Dispatch: Boris Johnson Survives No-Confidence Vote\n\nPlus: Will we need another COVID booster in the fall?\n\nHappy Tuesday! A Chinese influencer was hawking ice cream on a live stream on Friday-the anniversary of China's crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters-and showed a dessert that resembled a tank. His livestream abruptly cut off, prompting some of his 170 million young followers to research why a tank would inspire censorship. Maybe not what Chinese officials were hoping to accomplish?\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson survived a 211-148 no-confidence vote by members of his Conservative Party Monday that was triggered by ongoing criticism of his flouting of lockdown rules during the COVID pandemic. Other Conservative prime ministers have not long survived such division within their own party, but Johnson has vowed to continue in his post, calling the outcome a \"decisive result.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a new law Monday raising the age at which people can purchase semi-automatic rifles in the state from 18 to 21 and requiring social media companies to \"maintain easily accessible mechanisms\" for citizens to report threats of violence with the aim of making red-flag laws easier to enforce.\n\nA federal judge on Monday blocked Louisiana's new congressional district map from going into effect on the grounds that it contained only one majority-black district. (Louisiana's population is one-third black.) Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, said he would call the Republican legislature into a special session to draw a new map, which the judge ordered be completed before June 20.\n\nAn Australian court on Monday ordered Google to pay $515,000 to former Australian politician John Barilaro for failing to take down from YouTube a campaign of \"relentless, racist, vilificatory, abusive, and defamatory\" videos attacking him, which the court ruled \"drove Mr. Barilaro prematurely from his chosen service in public life and traumatized him significantly.\"\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday charged five members of the Proud Boys far-right militia group, including one-time leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, with seditious conspiracy in connection with the January 6 riot at the Capitol. The Justice Department made use of the same charge earlier this year against members of another militia group, the Oath Keepers.\n\nThe Biden administration will suspend import tariffs on solar panels and invoke the Defense Production Act to goose production of solar panel parts in an effort to boost U.S. clean energy production, officials said Monday .\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson will live to party another day.\n\nHe survived a no-confidence vote by Conservative Party members in Parliament on Monday evening, winning 211-148-opponents needed a simple majority of 180 to oust him. Under party rules, he's now safe for a year from any more such challenges. His supporters in Parliament greeted the news of his victory with cheers and pounding on their desks.\n\nIt seems incredible, but yes, this is still about revelations that Johnson attended parties at Downing Street during COVID-19 lockdowns. London police fined 83 officials including Johnson for attending various garden, birthday, and holiday parties. Months ago it seemed Johnson was nearing the threshold of dissent in his party that would trigger a no-confidence vote. Then the war in Ukraine pulled attention from the scandal, and his response to the war-strong support for Ukraine-won him praise.\n\nBut other trouble has still been brewing-corruption allegations , a chaotic pandemic response , and inflation have all played a role in eroding his popularity. His party took a beating in local elections May 5, and policy disagreements such as whether to send refugees to Rwanda or ban noisy protests have fractured the Tories. On May 25, civil servant Sue Gray released her investigation of the \"Partygate\" scandal, concluding several gatherings \"should not have been allowed\" under the COVID-19 rules that Johnson's government had set. Conservative frustration boiled over, and enough Tory members withdrew their support to trigger the vote-though not until after Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebration this weekend, because no one steals the queen's thunder.\n\nJohnson declared the \"extremely good\" win a chance to leave Partygate behind and focus on \"what we as the government are doing to help people.\" Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said opposing Tories should give up: \"People have got to recognize they didn't get the vote of no confidence through. What they should now do is say, 'OK, we respect the democratic decision of the party, we're going to support the prime minister getting on with his job.'\" If wishes were fishes, Cleverly.\n\nJohnson earned only about 59 percent support-former Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote in 2018 with about a 63 percent margin, and was still hounded into resigning a few months later. Johnson has happily resisted calls to resign so far, and his opposition is less organized than was May's, but he still has to face the fallout of a coming investigation into whether he lied to Parliament about the parties-a resignation-worthy offense, though Johnson denies lying.\n\nIn fact, Johnson's survival may if anything be a victory for the opposing parties. A snap poll by YouGov Monday found 60 percent of British voters thought Johnson should be ousted, and his overall approval has dropped to 26 percent.\n\nThe next general election is a ways out, but a by-election for two parliament seats on June 23 could serve as a referendum on how thoroughly Johnson has trashed the party brand. Minutes after Johnson's survival was announced, Labour leader Keir Starmer made it an election issue: \"Divided Tories propping up Boris Johnson with no plan to tackle the issues you are facing. Or a united Labour Party with a plan to fix the cost of living crisis and restore trust in politics.\"\n\nAnd Johnson is likely to face continued calls for his resignation even from former allies.\n\n\"You are simply seeking to campaign, to keep changing the subject and to create political and cultural dividing lines mainly for your advantage, at a time when the economy is struggling, inflation is soaring and growth is anemic at best,\" former treasury minister and longtime Johnson-supporting Conservative Jesse Norman wrote in a letter released Monday. \"Neither the Conservative party nor this country can afford to squander the next two years adrift and distracted by endless debate about your and your leadership.\"\n\nAt the dawn of the COVID-19 pandemic-before hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, before vaccine passports and myocarditis and \"excess deaths\" and the lab-leak hypothesis-perhaps the very first question to get sorted along hyperpartisan lines is whether the disease caused by the emerging virus was \"like the flu,\" whether it was an irritation to be dealt with through ordinary measures or a crisis that needed to be addressed with a full-society response.\n\nTwo years, 1 million deaths, and an alphabet soup of variants later, COVID-19 is more like the flu than it was at the outset-milder and less deadly than before, in the case of the Omicron variant and its descendants. And with Americans equipped with the cumulative immunity of millions of vaccinations and previous bouts with COVID, the disease is well into endemic status-meaning that, for the most part, we're now treating it like we treat the flu, too.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is what \"like the flu\" looks like when it comes to the ongoing effort to vaccinate Americans against the coronavirus. In preparation for an ordinary flu season, vaccine developers lock in by early summer the recipe they're going to roll out over the upcoming fall and winter. That's similar to what the COVID-vaccine conversation looks like at the FDA right now, where regulators will meet late this month to discuss whether booster shots should be updated in expectation of a likely fall surge.\n\n\"It's still a winter virus,\" Paul Offit, a virologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told The Dispatch . \"If you look over the last two and a half years, you get your biggest peaks in November, December, January, February-that's when the virus causes the most damage, the most likely to cause hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, death.\"\n\nNo American, no matter how COVID-conscious, has received a vaccine specifically keyed to thwart the Omicron variant and its ugly stepchildren-the vaccines currently in circulation are still based on earlier variants of the virus, judged sufficient for the current disease because of their ongoing ability to stave off serious illness and death.\n\nWhile increased immunity is unreservedly a good thing, one side effect is the pressure it puts on the virus to mutate more quickly-making it difficult for scientists to predict whether pharmaceutical companies should hasten to market a new variant-specific booster vaccine or continue to rely on the tried-and-true versions. Furthermore, it isn't just that we don't know how the virus will look in a few months-we also don't yet have a great sense of how our own immunity is likely to fare over time even in a hypothetical environment where the virus itself remained unchanged.\n\nThese questions will play a significant role not only in shaping what the COVID vaccine picture is likely to look like this fall, but also to what extent regular boosters will be a part of regular life in years to come, like the annual flu shot.\n\n\"We've achieved the first thing we wanted to achieve-pandemic 101, save the health care system. We've done that,\" Offit said. \"Goal No. 2  is to have a highly protected population against severe illness, especially over the winter. And we'll learn a lot this winter. We will. We'll see. Will this winter look like what it looks like now-a lot of cases, but because we have a highly immune population, not a lot of deaths? Or, because memory immune response has faded after natural infection or vaccination or both, then you're talking about the value of the yearly vaccine, at least for certain groups.\"\n\nThere's a lot in this story of a massive CIA leak: computer viruses, cloak and dagger trials, Nerf guns. It's a look at the alleged leaker and his path to and through the CIA, but also at the agency's failures. \"Nestled west of Washington, D.C., amid the bland northern Virginia suburbs, are generic-looking office parks that hide secret government installations in plain sight,\" Patrick Radden Keefe begins the New Yorker piece. \"Employees in civilian dress get out of their cars, clutching their Starbucks, and disappear into the buildings. To the casual observer, they resemble anonymous corporate drones. In fact, they hold Top Secret clearances and work in defense and intelligence. One of these buildings, at an address that is itself a secret, houses the cyberintelligence division of the Central Intelligence Agency.\"\n\nWe'll give you three guesses who this is about: \"A con man, a cancer, Hitler . Did people speak about even Richard Nixon in this way?\" If you guessed Steve Bannon, that's concerning, and you're ready for this profile . \"Bannon's the guy with a perpetual meta-motive, always working an angle,\" Jennifer Senior writes for The Atlantic . \"He's extremely skilled at getting others to do what he wants them to do. He speaks openly, almost exuberantly, about his talent for thought-puppetry. ... No one disputes that Bannon is very smart. He sweeps in information quickly, has a file-cabinet memory, can keep multiple tabs open in his brain. It's how he uses his brain that horrifies people-and I'm talking not just about Democrats, but about many of his former colleagues, who see in him a disordered, nefarious kind of brilliance.\"\n\nAfter all the fuss over the suspension and reinstatement of Ilya Shapiro at Georgetown Law-he quit. He explains why at the Wall Street Journal . \"It's all well and good to adopt strong free-speech policies, but it's not enough if university administrators aren't willing to stand up to those who demand censorship,\" Shapiro writes, after detailing a still-weak free speech policy. \"And the problem isn't limited to cowardly administrators. Proliferating [Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action]-style offices enforce an orthodoxy that stifles intellectual diversity, undermines equal opportunity, and excludes dissenting voices. Even the dean of an elite law school bucks these bureaucrats at his peril. What Georgetown subjected me to, what it would be subjecting me to if I stayed, is a heckler's veto.\"\n\nCOW LOOSE ON OKC HIGHWAY 🐄🤠 Sky 5 was flying over the moments when cowboys and emergency crews wrangled a cow that got loose on a busy Oklahoma City highway. https://t.co/pgZRNirP9R pic.twitter.com/NgnlgqiEEA\n\n- koconews (@koconews) June 6, 2022\n\nThe Dispatch Live (🔒) returns tonight.Steve and David will tackle a question we hear a lot: Is the country unraveling?

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nA Puerto Rican nationalist recently freed from prison has agreed to step aside from any formal role in New York City's Puerto Rican Day parade, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday.\n\n\"Oscar Lopez Rivera agreeing to step aside from any formal role in the parade is a critical step forward in refocusing our city's attention on the more important issues facing Puerto Rico,\" the Democratic mayor said in a statement.\n\nParade organizers had planned to honor Oscar Lopez Rivera, a member of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, which claimed responsibility for more than 100 bombings in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nLopez Rivera was not charged with carrying out any of the bombings himself, but he was convicted of charges including seditious conspiracy and served more than 35 years in prison before his sentence was commuted by Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nThe parade's decision to honor Lopez prompted sponsors including Coca-Cola, JetBlue and AT&T to drop out of the June 11 march up Fifth Avenue. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo also said he wouldn't be marching.\n\nHispanic societies in both the Fire Department of New York and the New York Police Department also said they would not be sending delegations this year, and the police commissioner said he wouldn't march. Law enforcement officers were among those injured in the FALN blasts.\n\nIt still wasn't clear late Thursday if Lopez Rivera still planned to march in the parade or what role, if any, his presence would constitute. A message left with the mayor's office wasn't immediately returned.\n\nThe parade's board of directors issued a statement saying they looked forward to marching with Lopez Rivera \"not as an honoree but as a humble Puerto Rican and grandfather.\"\n\nParade organizers have said they stand by their decision to honor Lopez Rivera as \"Procer de la Libertad\" - National Freedom Hero.\n\nThe 74-year-old Lopez Rivera has thousands of supporters who see him as a political prisoner, jailed for seeking independence for Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.\n\nDe Blasio is still marching, and more than 30 city lawmakers, including City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who was born in Puerto Rico, said they supported the decision to honor Lopez Rivera.\n\n\"The parade has always been about Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans, not any one participant,\" de Blasio said. \"Unfortunately, the parade and the plight of Puerto Rico have been overshadowed by needless controversy.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

But the jury appears deadlocked on those two charges against Dominic Pezzola, Politico reported.\n\nAll of the defendants, including Pezzola, were found guilty on four charges: obstructing Congress, conspiracy to prevent federal officers from discharging their duties, interfering with law enforcement and destroying government property.\n\nThe jury found Pezzola guilty of robbery, destroying government property and one count of assaulting a law enforcement officer.\n\nAs of mid-Wednesday, the jury was still deliberating whether all Proud Boys are guilty of a separate charge of assaulting or impeding a law enforcement officer.

One FBI informant who joined the Proud Boys and entered the Capitol on Jan. 6 said he understood that he was able to break the law in certain instances.\n\nKelly dismissed multiple requests from the defendants to declare a mistrial.

      "text": "Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes sentenced to 18 years for seditious conspiracy in Jan. 6 riot\n\nThe founder of the Oath Keepers extremist group was sentenced Thursday to 18 years in prison for orchestrating a weekslong plot that culminated in his followers attacking the US Capitol in a bid to keep President-elect Joe Biden out of the White House after the 2020 election.\n\nStewart Rhodes is the first person charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack to be sentenced for seditious conspiracy, and his sentence is the longest that has been handed down so far in the hundreds of Capitol riot cases.\n\nIt's another milestone for the Justice Department's sprawling Jan. 6 investigation , which has led to seditious conspiracy convictions against the top leaders of two far-right extremist groups that authorities say came to Washington prepared to fight to keep President Donald Trump in power at all costs.\n\nBefore handing down the sentence, the judge told a defiant Rhodes that he is a continued threat to the US, saying it's clear Rhodes \"wants democracy in this country to devolve into violence.\"\n\n\"The moment you are released, whenever that may be, you will be ready to take up arms against your government,\" US District Judge Amit Mehta said.\n\nIt was one of the most consequential cases brought by the Justice Department, which has sought to prove that the riot by right-wing extremists like the Oath Keepers was not a spur-of-the-moment protest but the culmination of weeks of plotting to overturn Biden's election victory.\n\nProsecutors had sought 25 years for Rhodes, who they say was the architect of a plot to forcibly disrupt the transfer of presidential power that included \"quick reaction force\" teams at a Virginia hotel to ferry weapons into DC if they were needed.\n\nThe weapons were never deployed.\n\nIn remarks shortly before the judge handed down the sentence, Rhodes slammed the prosecution as politically motivated, noted that he never went inside the Capitol and insisted he never told anyone else to do so.\n\n\"I'm a political prisoner and like President Trump, my only crime is opposing those who are destroying our country,\" Rhodes said.\n\nIn a first for a Jan. 6 case, Mehta agreed with prosecutors to apply enhanced penalties for \"terrorism,\" under the argument that the Oath Keepers sought to influence the government through \"intimidation or coercion.\"\n\nJudges in previous sentencings had shot down the Justice Department's request for the so-called \"terrorism enhancement\" - which can lead to a longer prison term - but Mehta said it fits in Rhodes' case.\n\nProsecutors argued that a lengthy sentence is necessary to deter future political violence.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy pointed to interviews and speeches Rhodes has given from jail repeating the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and saying it would be again in 2024.\n\nIn remarks just days ago, Rhodes called for \"regime change,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nPeople \"across the political spectrum\" want to believe that Jan. 6 was an \"outlier,\" Rakoczy said. \"Not defendant Rhodes.\"\n\nA lawyer for Rhodes, who plans to appeal his conviction, said prosecutors are unfairly trying to make Rhodes \"the face\" of January 6. Attorney Phillip Linder told the judge that Rhodes could have had many more Oath Keepers come to the Capitol \"if he really wanted to\" disrupt Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote.\n\n\"If you want to put a face on J6 (Jan. 6), you put it on Trump, right-wing media, politicians, all the people who spun that narrative,\" Linder said.\n\nAnother Oath Keeper convicted alongside Rhodes in November - Florida chapter leader Kelly Meggs - was expected to receive his sentence later Thursday.\n\nTwo other Oath Keepers, acquitted of the sedition charge but convicted of other offenses, will be sentenced Friday. And four other members found guilty of seditious conspiracy at a second trial in January are scheduled to be sentenced next week.\n\nThe convictions were a major blow for the Oath Keepers, which Rhodes founded in 2009 and grew into one of the largest far-right anti-government militia groups.\n\nRecruiting past and present members of the military and police officers, the group promotes the belief that the federal government is out to strip citizens of their civil liberties and paints its followers as defenders against tyranny.\n\nRhodes' sentence may forecast what prosecutors will seek for former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy alongside other leaders of his far-right group this month for what prosecutors said was a separate plot to block the transfer of presidential power.\n\nThe Proud Boys will be sentenced in August and September.\n\nRhodes, 58, and the other Oath Keepers said there was never any plan to attack the Capitol or stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory.\n\nThe defense tried to seize on the fact that none of the Oath Keepers' messages laid out an explicit plan to storm the Capitol. But prosecutors said the Oath Keepers saw an opportunity to further their goal to stop the transfer of power and sprang into action when the mob began storming the building.\n\nMessages, recordings and other evidence presented at trial show Rhodes and his followers growing increasingly enraged after the 2020 election at the prospect of a Biden presidency, which they viewed as a threat to the country and their way of life.\n\nIn an encrypted chat two days after the election, Rhodes told his followers to prepare their \"mind, body, spirit\" for \"civil war.\"\n\nIn a conference call days later, Rhodes urged his followers to let Trump know they were \"willing to die\" for the country.\n\nOne Oath Keeper who was listening was so alarmed that he began recording the call and contacted the FBI, telling jurors \"it sounded like we were going to war against the United States government.\"\n\nAnother man testified that after the riot, Rhodes tried to persuade him to pass along a message to Trump that urged the president not to give up his fight to hold onto power.\n\nThe intermediary - who told jurors he had an indirect way to reach the president - recorded his meeting with Rhodes and went to the FBI instead of giving the message to Trump. Rhodes told the man during that meeting that the Oath Keepers \"should have brought rifles\" on Jan. 6.\n\nBefore Thursday, the longest sentence in the more than 1,000 Capitol riot cases was 14 years for a man with a long criminal record who attacked police officers with pepper spray and a chair as he stormed the Capitol. Just over 500 of the defendants have been sentenced, with more than half receiving prison time and the remainder getting sentences such as probation or home detention.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio found guilty of Jan. 6 sedition plot\n\nFormer Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was convicted on Thursday of orchestrating a plot for members of his far-right extremist group to attack the U.S. Capitol in a desperate bid to keep Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA jury in Washington, D.C., found Tarrio guilty of seditious conspiracy after hearing from dozens of witnesses over more than three months in one of the most serious cases brought in the stunning attack that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021, as the world watched on live TV.\n\nIt's a significant milestone for the Justice Department, which has now secured seditious conspiracy convictions against the leaders of two major extremist groups prosecutors say were intent on keeping Democrat Joe Biden out of the White House at all costs. The charge carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years.\n\nTarrio was a top target of what has become the largest Justice Department investigation in American history.\n\nHe led the neo-fascist group - known for street fights with left-wing activists - when Trump infamously told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" during his first debate with Biden.\n\nTarrio wasn't in Washington on Jan. 6, because he had been arrested two days earlier in a separate case and ordered out of the capital city.\n\nBut prosecutors said he organized and directed the attack by Proud Boys who stormed the Capitol that day.\n\nProsecutors told jurors the group viewed itself as \"Trump's army\" and was prepared for \"all-out war\" to stop Biden from becoming president.\n\nThe Proud Boys were \"lined up behind Donald Trump and willing to commit violence on his behalf,\" prosecutor Conor Mulroe said in his closing argument.\n\nThe backbone of the government's case was hundreds of messages exchanged by Proud Boys in the days leading up to Jan. 6 that show the far-right extremist group peddling Trump's false claims of a stolen election and trading fears over what would happen when Biden took office.\n\nAs Proud Boys swarmed the Capitol, Tarrio cheered them on from afar, writing on social media: \"Do what must be done.\"\n\nIn a Proud Boys encrypted group chat later that day someone asked what they should do next.\n\nTarrio responded: \"Do it again.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" Tarrio wrote in another message. \"We did this.\"\n\nDefense lawyers denied there was any plot to attack the Capitol or stop Congress' certification of Biden's win. A lawyer for Tarrio sought to push the blame onto Trump, arguing the former president incited the pro-Trump mob's attack when he urged the crowd near the White House to \"fight like hell.\"\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's words. It was his motivation. It was his anger that caused what occurred on January 6th in your beautiful and amazing city,\" attorney Nayib Hassan said in his final appeal to jurors. \"It was not Enrique Tarrio. They want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and those in power.\"\n\nTarrio, a Miami resident, was charged and tried with four other Proud Boys: Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter leader. Rehl led a group chapter in Philadelphia. Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, was a self-described Proud Boys organizer.\n\nPezzola was a group member from Rochester, New York.\n\nThe Justice Department hadn't tried a seditious conspiracy case in a decade before a jury convicted another extremist group leader, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, of the Civil War-era charge last year.\n\nOver the course of two Oath Keepers trials, Rhodes and five other members were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors said was a separate plot to forcibly halt the transfer of presidential power from Trump to Biden.\n\nThree defendants were acquitted of the sedition charge, but convicted of obstructing Congress' certification of Biden's electoral victory.\n\nThe Justice Department has yet to disclose how much prison time it will seek when the Oath Keepers are sentenced next month.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Pardoning Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes for Capitol riot plot would be 'frightening': judge\n\nWASHINGTON - The federal judge who presided over the seditious conspiracy case against Oath Keepers members said Wednesday that it would be \"frightening\" if the anti-government group's founder, Stewart Rhodes, is pardoned for orchestrating a violent plot to keep Donald Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump repeatedly has vowed to pardon rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago.\n\nRhodes is serving an 18-year prison sentence after a jury convicted him and other Oath Keepers members of seditious conspiracy, the most serious charge stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta alluded to the prospect of Rhodes receiving a presidential pardon as he sentenced William Todd Wilson, a former Oath Keepers member from North Carolina who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"The notion that Stewart Rhodes could be absolved of his actions is frightening and ought to be frightening to anyone who cares about democracy in this country,\" Mehta said.\n\nMehta isn't the first judge at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., to criticize the possibility that Trump could pardon hundreds of Capitol rioters when he returns to the White House next month.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump nominee, said during a hearing last month that it would be \" beyond frustrating and disappointing \" if the Republican president-elect issues blanket pardons to Capitol rioters.\n\nOn the campaign trial this year, Trump repeatedly referred to Jan. 6 rioters as \"hostages\" and \"patriots\" and said he \"absolutely\" would pardon rioters who assaulted police \"if they're innocent.\"\n\nTrump also has suggested that he would consider pardoning former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a separate plot to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power from Trump to President Joe Biden.\n\nOver 20 judges have presided over more than 1,500 cases against people charged in the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nMany Capitol riot defendants have asked for post-election delays in their cases, but judges largely have denied their requests and forged ahead with sentencings, guilty pleas and other hearings.\n\nWilson, 48, of Newton Grove, North Carolina, was one of several Oath Keepers who cooperated with the Justice Department's investigation of the far-right extremist group - one of the most consequential prosecutions arising from the Jan. 6 siege.\n\nMehta sentenced Wilson to one year of home detention and three years of probation instead of prison. Prosecutors had recommended one year of incarceration for Wilson, a U.S. Army veteran and former firefighter.\n\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nThe judge praised Wilson's courage for acknowledging his guilt while many of his co-conspirators have not.\n\n\"Setting the history books straight came at a great price to you,\" Mehta told Wilson, who lost his military benefits after his guilty plea in May 2022.\n\nRhodes and his followers amassed weapons and set up \"quick reaction force\" teams at a Virginia hotel that could ferry guns into the nation's capital if they were needed to support their plot.\n\nThe guns stayed at the hotel, but Mehta said it is chilling to think that \"one order from a madman\" could have led to weapons deployed during a riot.\n\n\"Just to speak those words out loud ought to be shocking to anyone,\" the judge added.\n\nWilson didn't testify at any of the trials for Oath Keepers leaders, members and associates charged in the Jan. 6 attack. Prosecutors said he harmed his credibility by making contradictory statements to investigators about his criminal conduct.\n\n\"What we want to hear from witnesses is the truth, unvarnished and without an attempt to curry favor with the government,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy.\n\nWilson expressed remorse and shame for his role in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"I have lost a lot of things since then,\" he said. \"The mental burden that this has had on me has been almost unbearable.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

He was acquitted of two other conspiracy charges.\n\nProsecutors said Rhodes began planning an armed insurrection shortly after President Joe Biden won the election to stop the transfer of power and keep former President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\nRhodes, once a promising Yale Law School graduate , planned to bring ammunition and firearms to Washington and organized training for fellow rioters to learn \"paramilitary combat tactics,\" according to the Justice Department.\n\nRhodes called on his followers to fight to defend Trump, discussed the possibility of a \"bloody\" civil war and warned the Oath Keepers may have to \"rise up in insurrection\" to defeat Biden if Trump didn't act, according to testimony.\n\nFellow Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs, who leads the Florida chapter of the extremist group, was also convicted of sedition while three other co-defendants were cleared of the charge.\n\nAll five defendants were found guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding - Congress' certification of Biden's election victory.\n\nRhodes and Meggs are the first people in nearly 30 years to be convicted of a seditious conspiracy charge, which calls for up to 20 years in prison.\n\nOn trial alongside Rhodes were Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy intelligence officer from Virginia; and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group.\n\nDefense attorneys argued that their clients were only in the capital on Jan. 6 to protect Trump allies like Roger Stone and others. They claimed that Rhodes' rhetoric was nothing but bravado and that the Oath Keepers had no plan to attack the Capitol.\n\nRhodes, who took the stand in his own defense, said that was upset when the mob stormed the Capitol, calling his followers \"stupid\" for going inside.\n\nRhodes spent thousands of dollars on an AR-platform rifle, magazines, mounts, sights and other equipment on his way to Washington ahead of the riot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJurors watched surveillance footage from the Virginia hotel where some Oath Keepers stashed weapons for \"quick reaction force\" teams prosecutors said were ready to get weapons into the city quickly if they were needed. The weapons were ultimately never used.\n\nOn the day of the riot, Oath Keepers were seen wearing combat gear and forcing their way into the Capitol. Prosecutors said Rhodes stayed back like a \"general surveying his troops on the battlefield.\"\n\nAfter the riot, Oath Keepers celebrated at a local Olive Garden.\n\nRhodes pressured Trump to fight to stay in the White House in the weeks ahead of Jan. 6, the trial revealed.\n\nShortly after the election, Rhodes texted a group chat that included Stone called \"FOS\" - or \"Friends of Stone\" - \"So will you step up and push Trump to FINALLY take decisive action?\"\n\nAnother man who told jurors he had an indirect way to contact Trump testified that Rhodes tried to persuade him to pass the ex-president a message urging him not to give up the presidency. The man recorded the meeting and went to the FBI instead of giving the message to Trump.\n\n\"If he's not going to do the right thing and he's just gonna let himself be removed illegally then we should have brought rifles,\" Rhodes said during that meeting, according to a recording played for jurors. \"We should have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang (expletive) Pelosi from the lamppost,\" Rhodes said, referring to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThree other Oath Keepers previously pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy. The last time the Justice Department had secured such a conviction at trial was in the 1995 prosecution of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb New York City landmarks.\n\nWith Post Wires"

U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly agreed to release Bertino pending a sentencing hearing that wasn't immediately scheduled.\n\nBertino also pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawfully possessing firearms in March 2022 in Belmont, North Carolina. Kelly accepted his guilty plea to both charges during a brief hearing after the case against Bertino was filed Thursday.\n\nJustice Department prosecutor Erik Kenerson said estimated sentencing guidelines for Bertino's case recommend a prison sentence ranging from four years and three months to five years and three months.

Two of them - Matthew Greene and Charles Donohoe - pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying the Electoral College vote.\n\nProud Boys members describe the group as a politically incorrect men's club for \"Western chauvinists.\" They have brawled with antifascist activists at rallies and protests. Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, who founded the Proud Boys in 2016, sued the Southern Poverty Law Center for labeling it as a hate group.\n\nNordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter president and a member of the group's national \"Elders Council.\" Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, is a self-described Proud Boys organizer.

      "text": "Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes' path: From Yale to jail\n\nPHOENIX - Long before he assembled one of the largest far-right anti-government militia groups in U.S. history, before his Oath Keepers stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 , Stewart Rhodes was a promising Yale Law School graduate.\n\nHe secured a clerkship on the Arizona Supreme Court, in part thanks to his unusual life story: a stint as an Army paratrooper cut short by a training accident, followed by marriage, college and an Ivy League law degree.\n\nThe clerkship was one more rung up from a hardscrabble beginning. But rather than fitting in, Rhodes came across as angry and aggrieved.\n\nHe railed to colleagues about how the Patriot Act, which gave the government greater surveillance powers after the Sept. 11 attacks, would erase civil liberties. He referred to Vice President Dick Cheney as a fascist for supporting the Bush administration's use of \"enemy combatant\" status to indefinitely detain prisoners.\n\n\"He saw this titanic struggle between people like him who wanted individual liberty and the government that would try to take away that liberty,\" said Matt Parry, who worked with Rhodes as a clerk for Arizona Supreme Court Justice Mike Ryan.\n\nRhodes alienated his moderate Republican boss and eventually left the steppingstone job. Since then he has ordered his life around a thirst for greatness and deep distrust of government.\n\nHe turned to forming a group rooted in anti-government sentiment, and his message resonated. He gained followers as he went down an increasingly extremist path that would lead to armed standoffs, including with federal authorities at Nevada's Bundy Ranch . It culminated last year, prosecutors say, with Rhodes engineering a plot to violently stop Democrat Joe Biden from becoming president.\n\nRhodes, 57, will be back in court Tuesday, but not as a lawyer. He and four others tied to the Oath Keepers are being tried on charges of seditious conspiracy , the most serious criminal allegation leveled by the Justice Department in its far-reaching prosecution of rioters who attacked the Capitol. The charge carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison upon conviction.\n\nRhodes, Jessica Watkins, Thomas Caldwell, Kenneth Harrelson and Kelly Meggs are the first Jan. 6 defendants to stand trial under a rarely used, Civil War-era law against attempting to overthrow the government or, in this case, block the transfer of presidential power.\n\nThe trial will put a spotlight on the secretive group Rhodes founded in 2009 that has grown to include thousands of claimed members and loosely organized chapters across the country, according to Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim deputy director of research with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project.\n\nFor Rhodes, it will be a position at odds with the role of greatness that he has long envisioned for himself, said his estranged wife, Tasha Adams.\n\n\"He was going to achieve something amazing,\" Adams said. \"He didn't know what it was, but he was going to achieve something incredible and earth shattering.\"\n\nRhodes was born in Fresno, California. He shuttled between there and Nevada, sometimes living with his mother and other times with grandparents who were migrant farm workers, part of a multicultural extended family that included Mexican and Filipino relatives. His mother was a minister who had her own radio show in Las Vegas and went by the name Dusty Buckle, Adams said.\n\nRhodes joined the Army fresh out of high school and served nearly three years before he was honorably discharged in January 1986 after breaking his back in a parachuting accident.\n\nHe recovered and was working as a valet in Las Vegas when he met Adams in 1991. He was 25, she was 18.\n\nHe had a sense of adventure that was attractive to a young woman brought up in a middle-class, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints family. A few months after the couple started dating, Rhodes accidentally dropped a gun and shot out his eye. He now wears an eye patch.\n\nAdams' family had set aside money for her to go to college, but after their wedding Rhodes decided he should be the first to attend school. He told her she would need to quit her job teaching ballroom and country dancing and instead support them both by working full time as a stripper so he could focus on doing an excellent job in school, according to Adams. They married, but she found stripping degrading and it clashed with her conservative Mormon upbringing, she said.\n\n\"Every night the drive was just so bad. I would just throw up every single night before I went in, it was just so awful,\" Adams said. Rhodes would pressure her to go further, increase her exposure or contact with men to make more money, she said. \"It was never enough ... I felt like I had given up my soul.\"\n\nShe quit when she got pregnant with their first child, and the couple moved back in with her family. They worried about her but didn't want to push too far for fear of losing her altogether. By then, Rhodes was the center of her orbit.\n\nRhodes' lawyer declined to make him available for an interview and Rhodes declined to answer a list of questions sent by The Associated Press.\n\nAfter finishing college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Rhodes went to work in Washington as a staffer for Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican congressman, and later attended Yale, with stints in between as an artist and sculptor. Paul did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRhodes' college transcripts earned him entry to several top schools, Adams said. While at Yale, Adams took care of their growing family in a small apartment while he distinguished himself with an award for a paper arguing that the George W. Bush administration's use of enemy combatant status to hold people suspected of supporting terrorism indefinitely without charge was unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the Arizona clerkship, the family bounced to Montana and back to Nevada, where he worked on Paul's presidential campaign in 2008. That's when Rhodes also began to formulate his idea of starting the Oath Keepers. He put a short video and blog post on Blogspot and \"it went viral overnight,\" Adams said. Rhodes was interviewed by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, but also more mainstream media figures such as Chris Matthews and Bill O'Reilly.\n\nHe formally launched the Oath Keepers in Lexington, Massachusetts, on April 19, 2009, where the first shot in the American Revolution was fired.\n\n\"We know that if a day should come in this country when a full-blown dictatorship would come or tyranny, from the left or from the right, we know that it can only happen if those men, our brothers in arms, go along and comply with unconstitutional, unlawful orders,\" Rhodes said in his Lexington speech, which didn't garner any news coverage.\n\nThe group's stated goal was to get past and present members of the military, first responders and police officers to honor the promise they made to defend the Constitution against enemies. The Oath Keepers issued a list of orders that its members wouldn't obey, such as disarming citizens, carrying out warrantless searches and detaining Americans as enemy combatants in violation of their right to jury trials.\n\nRhodes was a compelling speaker and especially in the early years framed the group as \"just a pro-Constitution group made up of patriots,\" said Sam Jackson, author of the book \"Oath Keepers\" about the group.\n\nWith that benign-sounding framing and his political connections, Rhodes harnessed the growing power of social media to fuel the Oath Keepers' growth during the presidency of Barack Obama. Membership rolls leaked last year included some 38,000 names, though many people on the list have said they are no longer members or were never active participants. One expert last year estimated membership to be a few thousand.\n\nThe internal dialogue was much darker and more violent about what members perceived as imminent threats, especially to the Second Amendment, and the idea that members should be prepared to fight back and recruit their neighbors to fight back, too.\n\n\"Time and time again, Oath Keepers lays the groundwork for individuals to decide for themselves, violent or otherwise criminal activity is warranted,\" said Jackson, an assistant professor at the University at Albany.\n\nA membership fee was a requirement to access the website, where people could join discussion forums, read Rhodes' writing and hear pitches to join militaristic trainings. Members willing to go armed to a standoff numbered in the low dozens, though, said Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesman for the group.\n\nShowdowns with the government began in 2011 in the small western Arizona desert town of Quartzsite, where local government was in turmoil as officials feuded among themselves, the police chief was accused of misconduct and several police employees had been suspended. A couple years later, Rhodes started calling on members to form \"community preparedness teams,\" which included military-style training.\n\nThe Oath Keepers also showed up at a watershed event in anti-government circles: the standoff with federal agents at Nevada's Bundy Ranch in 2014. Later that year, members stationed themselves along rooftops in Ferguson, Missouri, armed with AR-15-style weapons, to protect businesses from rioting after a grand jury declined to charge a police officer in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.\n\nThe following year Oath Keepers guarded a southern Oregon gold mine whose mining claim owners were in a dispute with the government. Still, Rhodes was never arrested.\n\nAs the Oath Keepers escalated their public profile and confrontations with the government, Rhodes was leaving behind some of those he once championed. Jennifer Esposito hired him as her lawyer after the group's early outing in Quartzsite, but he missed a hearing in her case because he was at the Bundy Ranch standoff. A judge kicked Rhodes off the case, and no lawyer would represent her.\n\nShe has no hard feelings, but Michael Roth, also represented by Rhodes in Quartzsite lawsuits, is less forgiving. He compared Rhodes's handling of his case to a doctor walking out of an operating room in the middle of surgery.\n\n\"He clearly just used us for publicity to gain membership in the Oath Keepers,\" Roth said.\n\nThe neglect culminated in a disbarment case eventually brought against Rhodes. He ignored the allegations, missed a hearing and wasn't even represented by a lawyer. The commission examining the case in 2015 found his conduct as an attorney wouldn't normally get someone disbarred, but his refusal to cooperate did.\n\nMeanwhile, on the national stage, Donald Trump's political star was taking off. His grievances about things such as the \"deep state\" aligned with the Oath Keeper's anti-governmental stance. While Rhodes didn't agree with Trump on everything, the group's rhetoric began to shift.\n\n\"With the election of Trump, now the Oath Keepers have an ally in the White House,\" Jackson said.\n\nFor much of the the Oath Keepers' history, the federal government was the enemy, but gradually the enemy became left-leaning people in the United States and antifa, or anti-fascist groups, became the primary menace, he said.\n\nRhodes wanted Oath Keepers to go to Cleveland to provide security for Trump - then set to be the GOP presidential nominee - at the 2016 Republican National Convention, even though no one had asked the group for protection, said Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff who served on the Oath Keepers' board for about six years.\n\n\"I said, 'Why are we going - so we can say we protected Trump? We are not going to get anywhere near Trump,'\" Mack said. \"I said, 'This was crazy.' All the other board members voted with me, and Stewart was mad.\"\n\nThat was a breaking point last straw for Mack.\n\nHe wasn't the only board member to walk away as they saw the direction of the group close up, Van Tatenhove said.\n\n\"Once they saw where he was going, they were a lot less comfortable,\" he said. But Rhodes always managed to weather the disagreements and hold onto power. \"He was always going to be the start and finish of the Oath Keepers.\"\n\nA voracious reader and charismatic speaker, Rhodes drew people in and had a talent for molding his message to his audience and holding onto power. He warmed to the \"alt-right\" movement as its profile rose. Van Tatenhove knew he had to leave when in 2017 he overheard a group of Oath Keepers, in a discussion in a grocery store, denying that the Holocaust happened.\n\nIn 2018, Rhodes went too far for Jim Arroyo, a former Army Ranger who serves as president of an Oath Keepers chapter in Yavapai County, Arizona. He rejected a push to send group members to the U.S.-Mexico border for an armed operation to support the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nArroyo said that hadn't been approved by any authority and argued that pointing a gun in the wrong direction along the border could stir an international problem. He refused to go.\n\n\"That's when he pretty much didn't want anything to do with us,\" said Arroyo, who eventually broke away from the national Oath Keepers and hasn't had contact with Rhodes in over four years.\n\nWhen Biden won the 2020 election, prosecutors say, Rhodes started preparing for battle. Rhodes and the Oath Keepers spent weeks plotting to block the transfer of power, amassing weapons and setting up \"quick reaction force\" teams with weapons to be on standby outside the nation's capital, prosecutors say.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, authorities say, two teams of Oath Keepers stormed the Capitol alongside hundreds of other angry Trump supporters.\n\nRhodes is not accused of going inside, but he was seen gathered outside the Capitol after the riot with several members who did, prosecutors have said.\n\nDefense lawyers have accused prosecutors of twisting their clients' words. They have argued that the militia group went to Washington only to provide security at events before the riot for right-wing figures such as Trump confidant Roger Stone and that there was never a plan to attack the Capitol.\n\nThe case has dealt a major blow to the Oath Keepers, in part because many people associated with it want to be considered respectable in their communities, said Carroll Rivas of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Of the approximately 30 Capitol riot defendants affiliated with the Oath Keepers, nine have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the attack, including three who have pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the ideas that Rhodes promoted have faded away.\n\n\"He came up with a blueprint that is going to be used in the future by people we don't even know about,\" Van Tatenhove said. \"I think it's very important for us to pay attention.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Justice Department seeks 33 years in prison for ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio in Jan. 6 case\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking 33 years in prison for Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy in one of the most serious cases to emerge from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, according to court documents filed Thursday.\n\nThe sentence, if imposed, would be by far the longest punishment that has been handed down in the massive Jan. 6 prosecution.\n\nOath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy in a separate case, has received the longest sentence to date - 18 years.\n\nTarrio, who once served as national chairman of the far-right extremist group, and three lieutenants were convicted by a Washington jury in May of conspiring to block the transfer of presidential power in the hopes of keeping Republican Donald Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 election.\n\nTarrio, who was not at the Capitol riot itself, was a top target of what has become the largest Justice Department investigation in American history.\n\nHe led the neo-fascist group - known for street fights with left-wing activists - when Trump infamously told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" during his first debate with Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nDuring the months-long trial, prosecutors argued that the Proud Boys viewed themselves as foot soldiers fighting for Trump as the Republican spread lies that Democrats stole the election from him, and were prepared to go to war to keep their preferred leader in power.\n\n\"They unleashed a force on the Capitol that was calculated to exert their political will on elected officials by force and to undo the results of a democratic election,\" prosecutors wrote in their filing. \"The foot soldiers of the right aimed to keep their leader in power. They failed. They are not heroes; they are criminals.\"\n\nProsecutors are also asking for a 33-year-sentence for one of Tarrio's co-defendants, Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach, Florida, a self-described Proud Boys organizer.\n\nThey are asking the judge to impose a 30-year prison term for Zachary Rehl, who was president of the Proud Boys chapter in Philadelphia; 27 years in prison for Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Washington, who was a Proud Boys chapter president; and 20 years for Dominic Pezzola, a Proud Boys member from Rochester, New York.\n\nPezzola was acquitted of seditious conspiracy but convicted of other serious charges.\n\nTarrio wasn't in Washington on Jan. 6, because he had been arrested two days earlier in a separate case and ordered out of the capital city.\n\nBut prosecutors alleged he organized and directed the attack by Proud Boys who stormed the Capitol that day.\n\nDefense attorneys argued there was no conspiracy and no plan to attack the Capitol, and sought to portray the Proud Boys as an unorganized drinking club whose members' participation in the riot was a spontaneous act fueled by Trump's election rage.\n\nTarrio's lawyers tried to argue that Trump was the one to blame for exhorting a crowd outside the White House to \" fight like hell.\"\n\nAttorneys for the Proud Boys say prosecutors' proposed sentences are extreme.\n\nNoting that the chaos on Jan. 6 was fueled by Trump's false election claims, a lawyer for Biggs and Rehl told the judge that \"believing the commander in chief and heeding his call should yield some measure of mitigation.\"\n\n\"The defendants are not terrorists. Whatever excesses of zeal they demonstrated on January 6, 2021, and no matter how grave the potential interference with the orderly transfer of power due to the events of that day, a decade or more behind bars is an excessive punishment,\" attorney Norm Pattis wrote.\n\nLike in the case of Rhodes and other Oath Keepers, prosecutors are urging the judge to apply a so-called \"terrorism enhancement\" - which can lead to a longer prison term - under the argument that the Proud Boys sought to influence the government through \"intimidation or coercion.\"\n\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta agreed with prosecutors that the Oath Keepers' crimes could be punished as \"terrorism,\" but still sentenced Rhodes and the others to prison terms shorter than what prosecutors were seeking.\n\nProsecutors had asked Mehta to sentence Rhodes to 25 years behind bars.\n\nTarrio, of Miami, and his co-defendants will be sentenced before US District Judge Timothy Kelly in a string of hearings starting later this month in Washington's federal court.\n\nIt's the same courthouse where Trump pleaded not guilty this month in the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith accusing the Republican of illegally scheming to subvert the will of voters and overturn his loss to Biden.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTarrio and three of his lieutenants were also convicted of two of the same charges Trump faces: obstruction of Congress' certification of Biden's victory, and conspiracy to obstruct Congress.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Using sedition and domestic terrorism laws against rioters is overkill\n\nW hen pundits first suggested bringing \"sedition\" charges against the Jan. 6 defendants, I predicted some likely adverse long-term consequences:\n\n\"The history of sedition prosecutions is rife with injustices, and the precedent, once established, becomes a grotesque Frankenstein monster. In many cases, the same people demanding prosecutions end up, when political fashions change, facing prosecution for the same offense.\"\n\nUltimately, the federal government chose to ignore civil liberty fears, and several defendants were tried and convicted under a rarely used 1861 seditious conspiracy law making it a crime \"to conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government ... or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States.\"\n\nRecent arrests of 35 individuals in Atlanta after an attack on a police training center on state charges of \"domestic terrorism\" show the continuing pertinence of civil liberty concerns.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia are following the same troubling and politically opportunistic approach as their counterparts in Washington, D.C. In each case, instead of limiting themselves to clearly defined, albeit more mundane, prosecutable offenses - such as property destruction, trespass, vandalism, and assault - they have ambitiously and needlessly piled on additional layers of crimes against public order such as \"seditious conspiracy\" and \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nEnacted in 2017, Georgia's law follows the sweeping verbiage of earlier state and federal sedition laws. It lists a grab bag of offenses - some familiar, some new - and clumsily attempts to graft them together with the all-purpose crime of domestic terrorism. These include disabling or destroying \"critical infrastructure,\" crimes resulting in \"major economic loss,\" intimidation of \"the civilian population,\" or attempts to \"alter, change, or coerce the policy of the government.\"\n\nWith good reason, those who fought the enactment of the law in 2017 sounded an alarm about the potential threat to constitutional rights.\n\nIn his critique of Georgia's law, Michael German, a former FBI agent and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, points out that terms such as \"domestic terrorism\" usually have \"politicized applications.\" Other critics note that historically the chief victims of laws of this type are civil rights and labor activists. Federal sedition laws have a similarly unsavory past, including prosecutions of anti-war activists, such as Eugene Debs, one of the founders of the Industrial Workers of the World and five-time Socialist Party of America presidential candidate.\n\nAs is often true in history, the events in Atlanta come laden with ample helpings of irony.\n\nMost notably, the most prominent of those charged is a lawyer from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that urged the broadest and most reckless application of sedition law after Jan. 6. According to an SPLC statement , the lawyer \"was performing a public service, documenting potential violations of protesters' rights. We are outraged that police officers present at the protest refused to acknowledge [his] role as a legal observer and instead chose to arrest him.\"\n\nThere is a valuable lesson here if people of goodwill on both the Left and the Right will act upon it.\n\nThey have an ideal opening to reach across the ideological divide and form coalitions to protect civil liberties. In doing so, they can draw inspiration from such historical examples as the pro-free speech alliance in the 1930s between Republican Alfred Landon, the GOP's 1936 presidential nominee, and socialist Norman Thomas, a six-time Socialist Party presidential candidate.\n\nA worthy item on the agenda of any modern coalition in defense of the Bill of Rights is to launch a full-frontal attack on the existence of these \"sedition\" and \"domestic terrorism\" laws and to emphasize that current laws protecting life, property, and person are more than sufficient to punish the offenders, whether in Washington or Atlanta.\n\nDavid T.

For a year, prosecutors repeatedly referred to \"Person One,\" easily identifiable as Rhodes, in their cases against Oath Keepers members.\n\nThe other alleged Oath Keepers on trial with Rhodes had all pleaded not guilty, including by arguing that they had no advance plan to storm the Capitol.\n\nThree members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges this year but were not called to the stand by the prosecution at this trial.\n\nProsecutors had charged Rhodes and the other defendants with crimes \"related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, which disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress that was in the process of ascertaining and counting the electoral votes related to the presidential election .\" The DOJ said the conspiracy involved a plan \"to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power.\"\n\nBiden defeated Trump in the Electoral College 306-232 in November 2020, and the riot occurred as Congress was certifying the results.\n\nFBI SAYS \"SIGNIFICANT\" PART OF RISE IN DOMESTIC TERROR INVESTIGATIONS IS DUE TO CAPITOL RIOT\n\n\"These defendants think that they are self-anointed to stand up for what they think is the real version of the law,\" DOJ prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy reportedly said during closing arguments last week, adding, \"They saw the riot unfolding at the Capitol, they threw their bodies at the cause, and they took it.\"\n\nOath Keepers defense lawyer Lee Bright reportedly contended that the DOJ had not proven its \"big three\" crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, arguing there was \"no plan to storm the Capitol ... no plan to breach the rotunda ... no plan to stop the certification of the electors.\"\n\nRhodes, who was arrested in January, was not accused of entering the Capitol but did allegedly enter a restricted area around it. The Oath Keepers leader is a former U.S. Army paratrooper who later graduated from Yale Law School. He founded the right-wing group in 2009.\n\nThe DOJ said Rhodes and his alleged co-conspirators used encrypted messaging in a conspiracy that began in late December 2020 to coordinate and make plans to meet in Washington. Prosecutors say that after the Capitol riot, he deleted information from his cellphone related to the allegations in the indictment.\n\nA seven-count superseding indictment was handed down against Rhodes and eight others in June, charging them with seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging duties, destruction of government property, civil disorder, and tampering with documents or proceedings.\n\nThe DOJ has described the Oath Keepers as \"a large but loosely organized collection of individuals, some of whom are associated with militias\" and said that the group had a specific focus on \"recruiting current and former military, law enforcement, and first-responder personnel.\"\n\nDuring the trial, former Oath Keepers Vice President Greg McWhirter, whom lawyers for Rhodes sought to call as a witness, was revealed this month to be a confidential informant for the FBI against the group in the lead-up to the Capitol riot.\n\nAnother former Oath Keeper, Abdullah Rasheed, also became an FBI informant against the group by providing the bureau with a recording of a video conference Rhodes had with Oath Keepers in November 2020, days after Biden had defeated Trump.\n\n\"The more I listened to the call, it sounded like we were going to war against the United States government,\" Rasheed reportedly said of Rhodes in court in October.\n\nThe New York Times reported this month that redacted court filings suggested \"the FBI had as many as eight informants\" inside the Proud Boys \"in the months surrounding the storming of the Capitol.\"\n\n\"The Government has paid individuals to gather information and evidence about the Oath Keepers and the Defendants. The Government has made use of some of that information and evidence in building its case for trial,\" defense lawyers for the Oath Keepers said in September, adding, \"What the Government knew - but only recently disclosed to the Defendants - was that none of the confidential human sources provided evidence of guilt on the part of the Oath Keepers as an organization, or the individual Defendants in this case.\"\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Capitol riot subpoenaed Rhodes in November 2021.\n\nLawyers for the Oath Keepers repeatedly and unsuccessfully sought to delay or change the venue of the jury trial in the nation's capital, citing the \"highly inflammatory and prejudicial hearings\" conducted by the Capitol riot committee and arguing that the District of Columbia is \"heavily-biased\" and \"anti-Trump\" and that this would create a prejudiced jury pool.\n\nThe DOJ argued, \"The defendants' litany of complaints about the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol's hearings do not justify a continuance in this case.\"\n\nThe department said earlier this month that roughly 900 people have been arrested related to the Capitol riot, including 278 defendants charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Members of the Proud Boys have also been hit with seditious conspiracy charges."

The men are facing charges for a coordinated attack on the Capitol that aimed to stop President Joe Biden from taking office in 2020.\n\nJAN. 6 FOOTAGE IN PROUD BOYS TRIAL SHOWS RAY TESTIFIES IN HIS OWN DEFENSED RIOTERS\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's words,\" said Nayib Hassan, Tarrio's lawyer, during closing remarks. \"It was his anger that caused what occurred on Jan. 6 in your amazing and beautiful city.\"\n\nProsecutors agreed that Trump was partly to blame for the insurrection on Jan. 6, but they said the Proud Boys were motivated by Trump's words to enact violence.\n\n\"These defendants saw themselves as Donald Trump's army, fighting to keep their preferred leader in power no matter what the law or the courts had to say about it,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Conor Mulroe said on Monday.\n\nAs of March, prosecutors have charged over 1,000 people in connection to the riot. The trial of Tarrio and former Proud Boys Ethan Nordean, Joe Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola is in the spotlight. The men face more than 20 years in prison.\n\nThe Justice Department has also secured convictions of 14 Oath Keepers members and affiliates, another far-right extremist group, for various felonies occurring on Jan. 6.\n\nSince the trial began in January, the jury has heard testimony from over 50 people, including two of the defendants, Rehl and Pezzola. The trial has shed light on previously unknown information about the insurrection, including new video footage of Ray Epps, a fellow rioter who became the center of right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nText messages were revealed in court that showed exchanges between Tarrio and Shane Lamond, a Washington police officer. The two were exchanging information in the weeks leading up to the attack.\n\n\"It was not Enrique Tarrio. They want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald Trump and those in power,\" Hassan said ."

Gus Bilirakis (R-FL). Rhodes was serving out an 18-year prison sentence when he was released this week because of Trump's commutation.\n\nOthers under Mehta's modified prison release conditions included Kelly Meggs, Roberto Minuta, Edward Vallejo, David Moerschel, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, and Joseph Hackett. Rhodes and five others were convicted of a rare seditious conspiracy charge for their outsize roles in organizing the riot as an answer to Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump commuted the sentences of 14 defendants and pardoned all of the more than 1,200 violent and nonviolent defendants who had been convicted over the riot. He also ordered his Department of Justice to dismiss all pending Jan. 6 cases, and his newly appointed interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., Ed Martin, has been filing those dismissal motions all week.\n\nRhodes, who helped organize the riot in encrypted chats and urged militia-style fighting at it, has remained remorseless over his actions despite the incident leaving dozens of police officers injured and Capitol property damaged.\n\n\"My only regret is that they should have brought rifles. ... We should have brought rifles. We could have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang f***ing Pelosi from the lamppost,\" he said days after the event.\n\nWilliam Shipley, a longtime lawyer who has defended some of the rioters who received commutations, questioned the judge's authority over the defendants, saying he was unsure if they were subjected to a supervised release period after leaving prison.\n\n\"Work is currently underway among the attorneys for those 14 - I'm one of them - to address the issue of whether/if the Supervised Release term must still be served,\" Shipley wrote on X."

Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and 10 others were charged with seditious conspiracy related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot .\n\nThe defense attorney said the defendants want to be able to question confidential human sources used by the DOJ or FBI to look into the Oath Keepers, but prosecutors are seeking strict limits from the presiding judge related to what the defense lawyers can ask the witnesses.\n\nJANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE SET TO TAKE CENTER STAGE AGAIN\n\n\"The Defendants are before this Court with their liberty interests at stake.

's, top federal prosecutor came as part of the monthly updates his office has been providing related to the Capitol breach and signals that Graves has not relented on seeking out alleged culprits more than 3 1/2 years after the incident.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office said 1,488 people faced charges, most of whom were accused of entering or remaining on restricted federal property. A large fraction of those charged were accused of assaulting a police officer or resisting law enforcement. A smaller portion faced charges of damaging or stealing federal property, having a deadly weapon with them, or, in rare instances, seditious conspiracy.\n\nNearly a thousand defendants have been convicted or pleaded guilty to charges and have received sentences, and more than half of them, 562, were sentenced to prison, according to Graves's office.\n\nSince last month, Graves has also been monitoring the defendants affected by the Supreme Court's decision in June to narrow the scope of an obstruction charge brought against 259 people.\n\nThe decision came in response to a challenge from one of the defendants, former police officer Joseph Fischer of Pennsylvania, who argued government prosecutors had wrongly applied the charge in his case.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not opine on the merits of Fischer's case, but it did deal a blow to the Department of Justice by ruling that the charge of obstructing an official proceeding requires some element of tampering with physical evidence.\n\nDozens of defendants could benefit from the ruling and have begun bringing challenges to their charges and sentences.\n\nOther defendants, such as those whose cases have been fully adjudicated and their sentences already served, may not see a benefit to diving back into the legal \"meat grinder,\" as defense attorney Bill Shipley described it.\n\nOne such defendant is Jacob Chansley, better known as the horned helmet-wearing \"QAnon Shaman.\" Chansley pleaded guilty to one charge of obstructing an official proceeding and has completed his 41-month prison sentence. Chansley did see a small victory Monday when a judge granted the return of his infamous helmet and spear despite objections from prosecutors.\n\nGraves's office has emphasized in its recent press statements that every person charged with obstructing an official proceeding also faced at least one other felony or misdemeanor charge and that prosecutors will be reviewing whether they need to forgo obstruction charges for defendants on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"The government will be reviewing individual cases against the standards articulated in Fischer, as well as the anticipated ongoing proceedings related to Fischer in the D.C. Circuit, to determine whether the government will proceed with the charge,\" the U.S. attorney's office wrote."

      "text": "Oath Keepers trial: Opening day brings vastly different views in high-profile Jan. 6 case\n\nT he prosecution and defense painted very different pictures in the joint trial of a group of Jan. 6 defendants, including members of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia, when opening arguments and testimony started on Monday.\n\nAt Washington, D.C.'s federal courthouse, prosecutors are working to try the defendants jointly with a rare Civil War -era \"seditious conspiracy\" charge, which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. They allege that the group meticulously planned for months to use Jan. 6 as a springboard to start an armed insurrection to overthrow U.S. democracy .\n\nThe defendants, who have pleaded not guilty to the charge of seditious conspiracy and other charges, claim that the members of the Oath Keepers present were only attempting to provide security to the Jan. 6 demonstration legally and were not involved in the bulk of the violence at the Capitol that day in 2021. One defendant, retired Navy Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Caldwell, 68, claims he was never even a member of the Oath Keepers, despite being lumped in with them, and never entered the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Notice the role these five defendants played: leaders,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler said in the government's opening remarks, according to CNN. He described the role of Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers who is one of the people on trial, as being \"like a general overlooking a battlefield while his troops stormed inside.\"\n\nNEW DATE EMERGES FOR CLIMACTIC JAN. 6 HEARING POSTPONED DUE TO HURRICANE\n\n\"Their goal was to stop by whatever means necessary the lawful transfer of presidential power, including by taking up arms against the United States government,\" Nestler proclaimed. \"They concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy.\"\n\nThe prosecution made extensive use of posters and screens to detail the activities of the group on that day, as well as displaying seized group messages and audio clips between each other. They made particular use of violent rhetoric used by the defendants, which they pointed to as proving intricate planning to overthrow the government.\n\nThe wife of one defendant, retired Army Sgt. Kenneth Harrelson, said this is a \"repeat\" of what has been said for nearly two years.\n\n\"It feels to me like a joke, a show. That's all it feels like to me is a show. And a show to which you just want to fall to sleep to,\" she told the Washington Examiner .\n\nAngel Harrelson and Sharon Caldwell, wife of Thomas Caldwell, both laughed off the arguments of prosecutors, calling them absurd. They particularly found humor in Nestler's argument that Caldwell aimed to use his experience in the Navy to \"use boats to get across the Potomac\" as part of a grand plan to seize the Capitol.\n\n\"Like George Washington crossing the Delaware,\" Sharon Caldwell joked.\n\nThe two dismissed the violent rhetoric seen in private messages as simple banter.\n\nSharon Caldwell told the Washington Examiner that she was with her husband the whole day on Jan. 6 outside the Capitol and that the two of them never went inside. She maintained that the two of them hardly knew the Oath Keepers as an organization, only befriending a few members independent of their group affiliation previously. Several Oath Keepers had Caldwell in their contacts on their phones as \"Commander Tom,\" not because he was their literal commander, but because it is customary for veterans to refer to each other by their former rank, she said, and the group didn't know his last name.\n\nSharon herself is going to take the stand at some point in the trial.\n\n\"I am optimistic. It is very nice to finally be on the offense instead of on the defense. I'll be taking the stand. ... We finally get to speak the truth,\" she told the Washington Examiner . \"I am fully optimistic he will be acquitted.\"\n\nThe high-profile trial is expected to take a minimum of five weeks, with the true length likely to go over that."

The boys and girls in the agencies have behaved more than just a little badly, and they know it. They committed serious crimes against our country and its citizens under color-of-law since 2015, ranging from seditious conspiracy clear up to treason (say, just for instance, the case of Col. Alexander Vindman using his Ukraine connections to lever Mr. Trump out of the Oval Office in the 2019 impeachment scam.)\n\nYou have whole C-suites of agencies teed-up on RussiaGate for felonies, misprision of felonies, abuse of power, deprivation of rights, lying under oath, conspiracy to commit fraud, and much more. You have Judge James Boasberg playing games in the FISA Court he presided over; Robert Mueller and Andrew Weissmann running a two-and-a-half-year Chinese fire drill to cover-up years preceding of FBI / DOJ misconduct; John Brennan, James Clapper, and Gina Haspel abusing the \"Five Eyes\" intel arrangements to turn the CIA on innocent citizens at home; the fifty-one current and former intel agents colluding to bury Hunter's Laptop to sway the 2020 election; the antics of Judge Emmet Sullivan in the Flynn case. . . .\n\nAnd then on to a whole new round of frolics under \"Joe Biden\" including the malicious prosecutions of J-6 protesters; the pipe-bomb caper at the DNC; the use of several agencies to censor speech and manage the news media; the treasonous negligence of Alejandro Mayorkas on the nation's borders; the DOJ-coordinated lawfare hounding of Mr. Trump and his adjacent lawyers; the Ukraine War project ginned up by the State Department's Victoria Nuland and cohorts; and the sinkhole of greed, malice, and medical homicide that was the Covid-19 operation, millions killed and disabled, and likely more of that yet to come from the vaccines, trillions in wealth purloined or just plain lost, and businesses destroyed in lockdowns. It's not a mere \"swamp,\" it's a whole forbidden planet of turpitude.\n\nThen there are the floaters and freelancers who move from one blob venue to the next, like lawfare artists Mary McCord, Norm Eisen, Marc Elias, David J. Kramer, or the girl-band of Lisa Monaco, Fiona Hill, Kathryn Ruemmler, Susan Rice, Samantha Power, Nellie Ohr. And finally, there are the real big fishes: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, Chris Wray, Merrick Garland, General Milley, and \"Joe Biden.\"\n\nAdd William Barr to that list for failing to reveal that he was in possession of Hunter's laptop as early as the fall of 2019. Of course, it was crammed with exculpatory evidence that could have ended impeachment No. 1 on day one of the initial hearings, yet he never alerted President's lawyers to its existence. Weird, a little bit. And also, for the effrontery of allowing Jeffrey Epstein to be killed in his Manhattan jail, and never offering the public a coherent account of how the cameras on the cellblock failed, or why the guards who fell asleep on-duty were disciplined with only 100 hours of \"community service.\"\n\nMy Gawd, they must be eating Xanax like tic-tacs in their drawing rooms and boudoirs as the name Kash Patel floats across their social media screens. Kash Patel, a real-live exterminating angel, will finally step in to the FBI Director's office and turn the investigative powers of the FBI on. . . the FBI! And its parent, the DOJ. The poetic justice is sublime. You must wonder: how does Mr. Patel get through the RINO-infested Senate confirmation process? Start with: what have they got him? Answer: probably not a goshdarn thing, not a hair out of place. More to the point: what has Mr. Patel got on them? (Especially Messers Thune, Barrasso, Cornyn, and let's just throw in the Democrat Mark Warner, VA, who was up to his eyeballs in RussiaGate as chair of the Senate Intel Committee.)\n\nAnd were Mr. Patel to land in the FBI Director's office 49 days from now, what additional info might he uncover about years of weaponized government with assistance from John Ratcliffe at the CIA and Tulsi Gabbard as DNI - who will access a pipeline to the vast national security server farm out in Bluffdale, Utah. So, in case you think that the document-shredding party currently underway in DC will conceal all that criminality, consider what lives forever in the alternate universe of cyberspace. There are additional NSA intel server farms in Fort Meade, MD, Augusta, GA, and San Antonio, TX, all with troves of agency emails and cell phone texts. Not to mention what whistleblowers-to-come might have saved on their thumb drives. And you may be sure that the whistles will be blowing, even while the culpable rat each other out. Remember too: there is the document dossier of FBI crimes that Mr. Trump had in his personal possession after leaving office- the reason for the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago, August, 2022, and Jack Smith's bullshit court case to justify it.\n\nIn a new wrinkle to things transitional, you have the news late Sunday that \"Joe Biden\" issued a blanket pardon to \"the smartest person I know,\" Hunter Biden, that covers every last criminal act he committed from January 1, 2014, to present, including bribery, wire fraud, money-laundering, trafficking minors for sex, handgun violations, tax evasion, crack-cocaine parties, and probably more.\n\n\"JB\" assured America more than once that he would never pardon Hunter. Turned out to be the joke that all his utterances were supposedly not. But, really, did you expect anything else? Do you see now, also, why Hunter pled guilty to those tax charges in the LA federal court? I'll tell you why: because in a trial all the mechanisms of the money transfers through a myriad of bank accounts would have been disclosed. And the money trail leads from the multiple accounts of Hunter's Rosemont Seneca operation to the personal bank accounts of Biden family members, brother Jim and wife Sara, possibly Hunter's half-sister Ashley, and, of course, \"the Big Guy.\" Where are their pardons? And where is \"Joe Biden's\" pardon for Joe Biden?\n\nIt is unfortunate that the way forward (to a national government different in scale, scope, and disposition toward its citizens) will require so much consorting with what is past.\n\nBut it must be if consequence is to be restored as a basic element in our constitutional arrangements.

If simply bounced off their benches, they could just take up new careers as NPR legal commentators or transsexual pole-dancers. Rather, what you've got here is an obvious seditious conspiracy, plain for all to see, orchestrated by the same legal Nosferatus as RussiaGate, the 2020 election, and the J-6 witch hunt.\n\nThe catch is, this time it is discoverable and subject to prosecution because the party running this legal insurrection no longer has its hands on the levers of power in the DOJ and the FBI as it did when they ran the aforementioned ops. And so, the mighty silence emanating from those two agencies just now should tell you something: namely, that cases are being carefully constructed to finally bring these despicable caitiffs to real and chastening law.\n\nIf you want to know one paramount reason for institutional failure in our country, look to the evil enterprise that calls itself \"Lawfare.\" It originated as a blog launched on September 1, 2010, founded by three key figures: Benjamin Wittes, Jack Goldsmith, and Robert Chesney. Over time it evolved into an activist operation, The Lawfare Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to (cough cough) \"Hard National Security Choices,\" and run under the shady umbrella of the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe point of Lawfare is self-evident in its name: it is an instrument of warfare against a perceived enemy which, for the past decade, has been the political faction led by Mr. Trump, the once-and-current chief executive of the federal government. Mr. Trump is a danger to the bureaucratic arm of the federal government because he has defined it as a racketeering operation and moved decisively to end its depredations.\n\nLawfare is the praetorian guard of the permanent DC bureaucracy, including especially its rogue intel actors, who function as enforcers for the Democratic party that largely staffs the bureaucracy.\n\nNorm Eisen, a Brookings senior fellow, is the chief operational strategist for the Lawfare enterprise. He has been active in all its ops, capers, and mind-fucks since Mr. Trump came on the scene in 2015 vowing to \"drain the swamp\" (i.e., end the racketeering). Norm Eisen holds leadership roles in two subsidiary Lawfare orgs: States United Democracy Center and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Eisen's broader connection stems from his history of orchestrating legal challenges against Mr. Trump - advising the Mueller investigation, drafting impeachment articles, and leading CREW's 200-plus lawsuits in Mr. Trump's first term.\n\nNow, following the Biden interregnum, Norm Eisen leverages a network of nonprofits (ACLU, Public Citizen, etc.) and left-leaning judges to file hundreds of new lawsuits to thwart the MAGA clean-up effort under Elon Musk's DOGE. Tax filings show that CREW's funding, in part, comes from George Soros's Open Society Foundations. Item: during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, CREW received $432,000 in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans from Newtek Small Business, which evolved into a financial holding company after acquiring National Bank of New York City in January 2023, rebranded as Newtek Bank.\n\nThe money-laundering through multitudinous foundations, NGOs, and \"non-profits\" is the essence of the Democratic Party's racketeering mode in league with federal bureaucracies such as USAID that dispensed billions of dollars to a vast network of activist recipients. Translation: it provides salaries (often six-figures) to party foot-soldiers whose only duties are to move the money through the organizational layers and to be available for such party tasks as ballot harvesting, vote-counting, and organizing riots.\n\nThis is the mischief that Mr. Trump seeks to put an end to, and so he must be thwarted at all costs by those whose lifeblood depends on the ongoing rackets. The so-called \"Resistance\" alliance between the Democratic Party and the bureaucracy seeks to prevent reform by any means necessary. Since they no longer control potent executive agencies such as the DOJ and the FBI for intimidating and punishing their enemies, their only recourse is the federal judiciary and its officers of the courts , that is, lawyers and judges practicing Lawfare.\n\nThe federal judges are political appointees, such as John J. McConnell from the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, who was a personal injury lawyer (i.e., \"ambulance chaser\") and major Democratic Party donor, giving nearly $700,000 to party causes, and serving as Rhode Island Democratic State Committee treasurer. Judge McConnell issued a wide-ranging restraining order against the DOGE-advised freeze of federal funding launched in February of this year. McConnell's daughter, Catherine, is a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Education, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022. See how that works?\n\nSimilarly, James Boasberg, a RussiaGate cast member, and as a presiding judge in the DC federal court in sixty J-6 cases. Independent journalist Laura Loomer alleges that Judge Boasberg's daughter, Katherine, works for Partners for Justice (PFJ), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is dedicated to defending \"criminal illegal aliens and gang members,\" including opposing their deportation, and that it receives significant funding from U.S. government grants, such as those from USAID. Judge Boasberg notoriously issued a restraining order last week against the deportation of Tren de Aragua gang members labeled by the DOJ as a terrorist organization. See how that works?\n\nNow, the difference between Lawfare and the practice of law is that Lawfare trafficks lavishly in lies to do its business in the courts and actual law practice is supposed to be dedicated to ascertaining the truth in matters that come before the courts. Lawfare is grounded in dishonesty - as is its main client, the Democratic Party. That is exactly why Judge James Boasberg went along with FBI Director James Comey's false warrant applications in the FISA court that enabled the RussiaGate operation to do its dirty business. Thus, the grand orchestrator of the Lawfare enterprise as a whole, Norm Eisen, is a sort of Father-of-Lies.\n\nRemember beyond all this sturm and drang stands an essential principle: the truth is sturdy and untruth is fragile.\n\nLike you, I am standing by to see what eventually comes out of the Trump DOJ in the way of cases that might definitively settle this mighty battle between Lawfare and the law.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Vance Says Trump Won't Issue Pardons For Violent Jan. 6 Defendants\n\nAuthored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance said on Jan. 12 that individuals who were violent during the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6, 2021, \"obviously\" should not be pardoned. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to use his clemency power for people who have been charged in connection to the incident over the past four years.\n\nThose who \"protested peacefully\" on Jan. 6 should receive a pardon, Vance told Fox News. He added that there is also a \"little bit of a gray area\" in some of those cases.\n\n\"I think it's very simple,\" Vance elaborated.\n\n\"If you protested peacefully on Jan. 6 and you've had [Attorney General] Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned .\"\n\nMore than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes in connection to the Capitol breach, according to records from the Department of Justice. A number of people were charged with misdemeanor offenses for entering the Capitol in an unauthorized manner, while some were charged with felonies.\n\nLeaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys groups were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to then-President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nVance said on Jan. 12 that he believes that \"a lot of people\" have been \"prosecuted unfairly\" over the past several years.\n\n\"We need to rectify that,\" Vance said. \"We're very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.\"\n\nAlso on the morning of Jan. 12, Vance responded to critics on social media who said that his comments to Fox News didn't go far enough, with some saying that all Jan. 6 defendants should be pardoned.\n\n\"I've been defending these guys for years,\" Vance wrote on social media platform X .\n\n\"The president saying he'll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback ... I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial.\"\n\nThat comment came in response to a prominent conservative social media account's statement on Jan. 12 that new footage has shown \"cops shooting innocent J6 protesters and [Vance] goes on Fox News and tells the world that only non violent protesters should get pardoned ... better rethink what you just said JD.\"\n\nVance noted that he donated to a Jan. 6 \"political prisoner fund\" and was criticized over it during his run for Ohio's Senate seat.\n\nIn a wide-ranging news conference last week at his Florida Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump suggested he would initiate \"major pardons\" for individuals arrested in the aftermath of Jan. 6.\n\nA reporter asked him, \"You said on your first day of office you were going to pardon Jan. 6 defendants. Are you planning to pardon those who were charged with violent offenses?\"\n\n\"Well, we're looking at it, and we have other people in there,\" Trump said , adding that \"people that didn't even walk into the building are in jail right now.\"\n\n\"We'll be looking at the whole thing. But I'll be making major pardons, yes,\" he added.\n\nThe president-elect has said on multiple occasions that he would carry out the pardons quickly after he is sworn into office on Jan. 20.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Freed Jan. 6 Prisoners Speak Out As They Begin To Rebuild Their Lives\n\nAuthored by Janice Hisle via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nProsecutors acted with \"unrelenting integrity,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said , as the Justice Department pursued cases against 1,583 people for events on Jan. 6, 2021 -a date etched into the American psyche with unforgettable images of vandalism and violence at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who had attracted a massive crowd to Washington that day amid a dispute over his 2020 election loss , decried these cases as \"political persecutions.\" He tossed out the prosecutions upon his return for a second presidential term on Jan. 20.\n\nSaying he was ending \" a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years, \" Trump commuted sentences for 14 serious Jan. 6 offenders and issued full pardons to all remaining defendants-1,569 people, based on federal data .\n\nTrump showed mercy even to those convicted of assaulting officers-a controversial move. He previously stated that only peaceful, nonviolent offenders deserved consideration.\n\nBut he justified that decision by pointing out that the convicted Jan. 6 defendants had already been locked up for years, often in \"inhumane\" conditions. They were targeted for political reasons and were punished more harshly than many people who committed worse offenses, including killings, he said.\n\nA half-dozen of the former Jan. 6 prisoners told The Epoch Times their side. The publication also reviewed Justice Department statements about each interviewee and dozens of other resources for this story.\n\nThe interviewees, ranging from a 25-year-old entrepreneur to a 55-year-old former New York police officer, say much information has been suppressed and distorted.\n\nThey, like many Americans, continue to question why security in and around the Capitol was clearly insufficient on Jan. 6.\n\nThey also suspect a government setup-and a coverup.\n\nAlthough officials have rejected such claims, a government watchdog's recent report reignited questions over the actions of \"confidential human sources.\" Twenty-six of these informants were present on Jan. 6, the Inspector General's report said.\n\nFour of the informants entered the Capitol; 13 others entered restricted areas on the grounds-without FBI permission. The FBI didn't authorize the informants to encourage violence, either. But the report left it unclear whether informants obeyed that order.\n\nThe interviewed Jan. 6 defendants say many Americans still incorrectly believe that police officers were killed in the melee; 140 officers were hurt, none fatally, despite initial reports.\n\nIt's unclear how many civilians were injured, but Trump supporters were the only people who died that day. Police fatally shot Ashli Babbitt, 35, and beat Roseanne Boyland, 34, who was knocked unconscious in a stampede; her cause of death remains in dispute. Investigators cleared officers of wrongdoing in both cases.\n\nThe Jan. 6 interviewees agreed that, as more videos surfaced, the American public has begun to see a wider, clearer picture of the day's events.\n\nBefore violence broke out, many thousands of people listened to Trump's speech at The Ellipse, a park about 2 miles from the Capitol, where Congress was preparing to certify the 2020 election results.\n\nTrump said the group should march to the Capitol \"peacefully and patriotically.\" But before his speech ended, protesters-possibly mingled with provocateurs-had already clashed with police at the Capitol.\n\nVideos show some people walking into the building through already-open doors-past police who made no attempt to halt them. Some of those nonviolent people faced criminal trespassing charges.\n\nOthers violently tangled with police, smashed windows, and forcibly entered the building. Nearly 200 people pleaded guilty to assaulting officers. Officials set property damage at $1.5 million.\n\nSeveral Jan. 6 interviewees say they regretted reacting badly amid the mayhem as police fired munitions and chemicals.\n\nSome people accused police of excessive, unprovoked force. Those accusers include a retired New York police officer. However, a Capitol Police report found all 293 reported uses of force were justified-and a survey found some officers complained they were discouraged from using sufficient force to repel aggressors.\n\nTwo of the six interviewees were convicted of assaulting officers-the offense that sparked much criticism of the Trump pardons. Both of those defendants' alleged assaults were tied to retaliating against police with pepper spray or pushing against barricades.\n\nAll six interviewees allege they were subject to constitutional rights violations, harassment, and other maltreatment because of their status as Jan. 6 defendants.\n\nNone of those interviewees was convicted of seditious conspiracy; one was acquitted.\n\nThey consistently stated that it was preposterous to call them \"insurrectionists\" and rejected prosecutors' assertions that they tried to halt the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAt most, the interviewees said they expected Congress to pause the election certification to allow further exploration of election irregularities in a half-dozen states. Some said they didn't even intend to protest; they just wanted to hear Trump speak and show support for him.\n\nAll expressed gratitude to Trump for acting on their behalf.\n\nAnd all are hopeful that a new congressional probe will \"uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people,\" as House Speaker Mike Johnson ((R-La.) stated on Jan. 22.\n\nSeveral Jan. 6 defendants said that now that they have regained their freedom, revealing the truth about Jan. 6 is their most fervent wish.\n\nAlexander Sheppard recalls that, as a schoolboy in Worthington, a historic central Ohio community of 15,000 people, he learned about Americans' constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nBut he says being prosecuted for Jan. 6 shattered his \"naïve\" notions about exercising his rights to free speech and protest.\n\nJust before Jan. 6, Sheppard was a 21-year-old marketing entrepreneur. He made a last-minute decision to make a six-hour drive from Ohio to Washington for Trump's \"Save America\" or \"Stop the Steal\" rally.\n\nHe arrived at 6 a.m., early enough to score a close spot at the Ellipse. He stood in a massive crowd, about a half-dozen rows away from the stage, as Trump delivered his speech that afternoon.\n\n\" It was an atmosphere of love and patriotism and love for our country, \" Sheppard said.\n\nBut after marching to the Capitol, he saw officers firing tear gas into the crowd. At times, he and others got \"riled up\" over police \"using unnecessary force on people.\"\n\nAmid the chaos, \"I made the dumb decision to go inside the building,\" he said. \"I didn't think I was breaking any laws. Like I said, I thought we had a First Amendment right to protest.\"\n\nUpon entering the Capitol, he and others were mesmerized by its grandeur. He took many videos and pictures that were later used against him.\n\n\"If I thought I were committing a crime, I wouldn't have recorded so much of it,\" he said, adding that he remained nonviolent and committed no vandalism.\n\nFatefully, Sheppard was nearby when Babbitt was shot; he drew his hands to his head in disbelief as she fell to the floor. His proximity to that much-scrutinized event probably made him more high-profile, he said. The officers escorted him and others out of the area.\n\nNearly two months later, just after Sheppard set foot inside the airport in Columbus, Ohio, for a business trip, about 10 federal agents swooped in.\n\nHe was stunned to be arrested. He was even more shocked to be facing a felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding, plus five misdemeanors for being disorderly and protesting inside the Capitol.\n\nSheppard was released to await trial . Two years later, in January 2023, jurors convicted him of five charges. His sole acquittal: a misdemeanor for entering a room where he photographed a portrait of America's first president, George Washington.\n\nA judge sentenced Sheppard to 19 months in prison, half the time prosecutors had sought.\n\nIn prison, Sheppard learned he was labeled a \"terrorist,\" which disqualified him from certain privileges.\n\nHe asks, \"How could I be labeled a 'terrorist' when I was charged with nothing violent?\"\n\nEven before the Supreme Court issued its June ruling , a judge agreed with Sheppard's attorney's contention that the Fischer case raised a \"substantial question\" about the validity of his sole felony conviction.\n\nSheppard's lawyer claimed \"that question will not be decided until after he has served more time in prison than is warranted by his misdemeanor convictions,\" a judge wrote in January 2024. \"Accordingly, he asks the Court to release him from prison at the end of his likely misdemeanor sentence.\"\n\nThe judge cut Sheppard's prison term to six months; he was released in May 2024.\n\nHe said he still benefited \"in a big way\" from Trump's pardon. It wiped his criminal convictions-but not charges-from his record. And it lifted his post-release requirements, such as obtaining permission to travel outside of southern Ohio, submitting to urinalysis, and reporting to a court official.\n\nNow 25, Sheppard has been doing menial labor but hopes to land a better job; he mourns the loss of his solid reputation and unblemished record.\n\nBut he sees public and media perceptions shifting.\n\n\"When I was facing more than 20 years in prison, I was a 'January 6 Insurrectionist.' Later on, I was referred to as a 'Capitol Rioter.' Now that I WON in the Supreme Court, was PARDONED by the President, and will have ALL charges dismissed, I am called a 'January 6 Participant,' he wrote in a Jan. 29 social media post.\n\nHe wants people to know: \"We were all denied constitutional due process, and that is why it made sense for President Trump to pardon basically everyone.\"\n\n\"This pardon, it really gives to all of us a new lease on life,\" he said. \"We get to start fresh.\"\n\nRachel Powell says she went to Washington on Jan. 6 to protect America's future for her eight children and seven grandchildren-but ended up being separated from them for many months because of it.\n\nNow 44, Powell said she had harbored concerns-which grew after the 2020 election-about election integrity in her home state of Pennsylvania. She wanted her children to inherit \"a fair and free vote.\"\n\n\" Everything in America depends on that ,\" she said.\n\nBut Powell admits regretting some of her actions on Jan. 6. Outrage over officers' seemingly unprovoked use of force hijacked her better judgment, she said.\n\nAccused of pushing barricades, Powell said that was a misperception. \"The police were moving the barricades towards us,\" she said.\n\n\" And people like me, I wasn't going to move ,\" Powell said. \"I was going to stand there and hold the line-because I had the right to.\"\n\nShe entered several locations in and around the Capitol. People were jammed into the West Terrace tunnel and falling on top of each other.\n\n\" I could hear a woman screaming for help at the bottom of that pile, \" near the tunnel entrance, Powell said.\n\nPowell helped other people to pull fallen protesters out of the way. \"By [the] time we got to the bottom of that pile ... there was Roseanne Boyland, clearly dead at my feet,\" she said.\n\nHorrified and fearful for her safety, Powell retreated to the other side of the building.\n\nIn an act she now sees as irrational, she decided to break a window. Powell thought that creating a new ingress point for protesters would prevent other deaths. \"And I know that that sounds crazy, but that's what it was,\" she said.\n\nPowell said people in the crowd passed implements to her, which she used to strike the window frame, including an object that prosecutors called \"an ice axe.\"\n\n\"And from using that tool for probably 60 seconds, they gave me a deadly weapons charge,\" she said, adding that the axe \"disappeared back into the crowd\" and she \"never saw it again.\"\n\nShortly after that, police fired exploding canisters of noxious gas, and she couldn't see or breathe. \"It's like, all of a sudden, it just snapped me out of it. And I was like, 'What are you doing?'\" she said.\n\nPowell struggled her way out and left.\n\nIn a little more than a week, the FBI circulated a \"wanted\" poster showing pictures of her in a pink knit hat and sunglasses.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2021, police raided her home in Mercer County, Pennsylvania; they broke through the door as a helicopter hovered overhead. Powell, who wasn't home then, turned herself in. She was freed under strict home confinement rules.\n\nAfterward, a court ordered Powell's minor children to remain in the custody of another relative. The separation was particularly gut-wrenching because Powell enjoyed more togetherness with her children than many moms. She became a single mother after her 17-year marriage disintegrated and was also a homeschooler and homesteader.\n\nHer case finally went to a bench trial in mid-2023. She denied leading any organized effort to overtake the Capitol despite using a bullhorn to direct other protesters. Powell told The Epoch Times that she borrowed the bullhorn from another protester, and she was relaying information about the Capitol's layout based solely on her observations that day-her first visit to the Capitol.\n\n\" I did not know the layout of the whole Capitol, \" she said, alleging that prosecutors \"tried to paint me as a ringleader.\"\n\nIn late 2023, a judge convicted Powell of nine charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding, destruction of government property, civil disorder, and \"physical violence ... with a deadly or dangerous weapon.\"\n\nIn early 2024, she began serving a prison term of 57 months-nearly five years-with no credit for three years of house arrest.\n\n\" I don't understand how that's happening in America, that American citizens can be detained in their homes for undetermined amounts of time ,\" she said, calling that practice an injustice that should end.\n\nPowell's experiences at a West Virginia prison caused her even more concern.\n\nShe was housed at the Federal Correctional Complex Hazelton-a facility where whistleblowers alleged \"a rampant culture of abuse and misconduct,\" several senators wrote in September 2023.\n\nThey called on the Attorney General and Bureau of Prisons to investigate. The Epoch Times was unable to determine the results of that probe by publication time.\n\nPowell alleges she witnessed deplorable conditions and medical neglect of inmates, echoing the whistleblowers' complaints.\n\nNow, Powell said she is on a mission to reform conditions at that prison \"because once you see it, you can't unsee it, and it would be wrong not to do something about it and to leave those women in there, suffering.\"\n\n\"It's the right thing to do,\" she said-the same phrase she used to describe her motivation for participating in the Jan. 6 protest.\n\nBut if she could do it over again, Powell said she would have just sat down in protest, \" and I would have never left that public sidewalk-ever.\"\n\nAfter being pardoned, Powell sees a bright future-for America and her family.\n\n\"I love our president. I think he's a good man. I think the next four years are going to be fantastic ... and I think that the time is ripe for these changes,\" she said.\n\nBeing away from her loved ones made her value them more.\n\n\"We're all gonna be stronger because of this, and we're all more loving ... we want more unity in our family,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like a phoenix rising from the ashes ... I really think it's going to be beautiful.\"\n\nBarry Ramey, then a 38-year-old aircraft mechanic, was living a good life in sunny Florida and was engaged to be married.\n\nBut around 5:30 a.m. on April 21, 2022, as he left his apartment to go to work, a tactical team rushed him in the parking lot, \"flashbangs thrown at me, and guns pointed at me,\" Ramey said. That was nearly 16 months after Jan. 6, 2021-and two months before his planned wedding date.\n\nAfterward, Ramey said he accepted responsibility for his actions, which included discharging pepper spray at police on Jan. 6. But he said the accusations and punishment he faced as a result were \"over-the-top.\"\n\n\" I know I committed a criminal act, but I'm not a criminal ... I don't live a life of crime, \" Ramey, now 41, told The Epoch Times after Trump pardoned him. He had no prior criminal history , court records confirm.\n\nAs Ramey awaited word on a possible pardon, \"it was definitely a nail-biting situation,\" he said. Ramey thought that he might only get his sentence commuted because his assault conviction classified him as a violent offender.\n\nHe also was connected to the Proud Boys, one of the most controversial groups of Jan. 6 defendants.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Ramey gathered with the Proud Boys group, although he did not know who they were at that time, his attorney said in a court record. Since then, Ramey said he and other Jan. 6 defendants started a Proud Boys chapter \"to look out for one another in very dangerous situations\" while incarcerated.\n\nFive Proud Boys were among the 14 offenders whose sentences Trump commuted; they were freed from prison, but their convictions remain in their records.\n\nRamey received a \"full and unconditional\" pardon.\n\n\"It feels good to know I don't have to live my life as a convicted felon,\" he said. \"I can go back to being a productive member of society and trying to leave the world a better place than I found it.\"\n\nIn March 2023, Ramey was sentenced to five years in prison for felony charges of civil disorder and \"assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers,\" a Justice Department statement noted, along with misdemeanors for disorderly conduct and \"physical violence\" on the Capitol grounds; he did not enter the building, his attorney said .\n\nProsecutors argued he deserved a harsher prison term because he attacked police with a \"deadly and dangerous weapon\"-the pepper spray.\n\nRamey countered: \"The police use it all the time. They even get pepper-sprayed in their training. So [if] it wasn't deadly and dangerous then, is it deadly and dangerous now?\"\n\nRead the rest here...\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "\"Blood, Feces, & Terror\": The Trump Pardons Trigger Judicial Rage\n\nAuthored by Jonathan Turley,\n\nEven though President Trump had made it a campaign pledge to pardon those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, the roughly 1,500 pardons Trump issued on his first day produced familiar reactions from politicians and pundits.\n\nIn Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner pledged to pursue those pardoned or commuted with new charges on the state level - eclipsing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in repackaging federal crimes as state offenses.\n\nOthers cited the pardons as evidence of an even greater plot or purpose. On MSNBC, former NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund head Sherrilyn Ifill declared that the pardons were all part of a plan to build an army of \"brownshirts.\"\n\nNot to be outdone, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) warned that Trump was issuing pardons to create a \"reserve army of political foot soldiers to act on behalf of MAGA and Donald Trump.\"\n\nSuch hyperbole, particularly the Nazi references, is now commonplace. Indeed, the left jumped the shark on the Nazi-mania and death-of-democracy mantra months ago. This week, however, some of the most strident comments seem to be coming from the federal bench itself.\n\nIndeed, some judges used dismissal hearings to launch into what seemed at points like cable-ready commentary. Take District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, an Obama appointee who had previously presided over Trump's election interference case.\n\nChutkan had been criticized for failing to recuse herself from that case after she made highly controversial statements about Trump from the bench. In a sentencing hearing of a Jan. 6 rioter in 2022, Chutkan said that the rioters \"were there in fealty, in loyalty, to one man - not to the Constitution.\" She added then, \"[i]t's a blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this day.\" That \"one person\" was still under investigation at the time and, when Trump was charged, Chutkan refused to let the case go.\n\nShe then pursued Trump with a vigor second only to Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nIn the latest hearing, Chutkan again decided to use the bench to amplify her own views of the pardons and Jan. 6. She proclaimed that the pardons could not change the \"tragic truth\" and \"cannot whitewash the blood, feces and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"\n\nIn fairness, judges often express the gravity of offenses at sentencing, and most of us certainly share the strong revulsion over what occurred on Jan. 6. However, these cases are being dismissed after an election whose winner explicitly pledged to close the prosecutions through executive clemency.\n\nThe defendant in her courtroom was there to have a required dismissal entered in his case, not to hear Judge Chutkan speaking truth to power. In this case, she is the power. It is the power to rule dispassionately on the specific case before her. It is not the power to hold court on the merits of presidential decisions.\n\nDown the hall, Chutkan's colleague Judge Beryl Howell, also an Obama appointee, lashed out at Trump's actions, writing, \"[T]his Court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement.\"\n\nYet, all of that paled in comparison to what their colleague U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, also an Obama appointee, did with his Jan. 6 cases.\n\nHe ordered J6 defendants to seek prior approval before going to Capitol Hill or even coming within any of the 69 square miles of the nation's Capitol. Thus Mehta practically banished Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and seven other defendants.\n\nIt does not appear that the Trump Justice Department requested such restrictions, but Mehta was able to impose them because those defendants had received commutations rather than pardons. A commutation does not require the dismissal of a case, and courts are generally allowed to set conditions for released defendants.\n\nHowever, these are new conditions imposed after presidential commutations. More importantly, they could affect the exercise of First Amendment rights from free speech to free association to the right to petition the government. For example, Rhodes and others would have to disclose intended meetings with members of Congress or participation in political events.\n\nRhodes previously asked to speak to the House committee that investigated the riot, but the Democrat-controlled committee refused to allow it. (A Yale law graduate, Rhodes insisted that the hearing be conducted in public, the very condition Hunter Biden made with the support of some of these same members.)\n\nWhat if Rhodes now wants to meet privately with members to supply his testimony? He would need Mehta to approve it and potentially make such plans public.\n\nIn my book, \" The Indispensable Right ,\" I discuss the J6 cases and serious concerns over what a top Justice Department official called the \"shock and awe\" campaign to make an example of the defendants by throwing the book at them.\n\nNevertheless, even though I opposed the seditious conspiracy charges on legal grounds, I did not support the pardoning of violent offenders who attacked police officers.\n\nThe court system plays a key role in either tamping down or fueling rage in society. The book details how \"rage rhetoric\" often became state rage during periods of crackdowns on free speech. Over the last two centuries, some judges used their courtrooms to lash out at political opponents, anarchists, unionists or communists.\n\nI was particularly concerned in these cases with sentences that seemed visceral, even gratuitous, in denying free speech rights.\n\nIn Washington, judges imposed limits on what political views defendants could read or share.\n\nFor example, Judge Reggie B. Walton, a Bush appointee who had previously called Trump a \"charlatan,\" had before him a typical Jan. 6 case - that of Daniel Goodwyn, 35, of Corinth, Texas. Goodwyn pleaded guilty on Jan. 31, 2023, to one misdemeanor count of entering and remaining in a restricted building. It is a minor offense that generated little jail time.\n\nHowever, Walton faulted Goodwyn for appearing on Fox News and spreading \"disinformation,\" and so he ordered the government to monitor what he was viewing and discussing. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rebuked Walton for that surveillance order, but he doubled down. On remand, the Biden Justice Department insisted that Goodwyn was unrepentant and still viewing \"extremist media.\"\n\nWalton, therefore, determined that the risk was too great in Goodwyn spreading \"false narratives\" when we are \"on the heels of another election.\"\n\nNow, his colleague is similarly ordering that those freed under Trump's commutations will disclose and seek approval to go to the Capitol to speak with members or other citizens.\n\nMany of us have long viewed the Jan. 6 riot as a desecration of our constitutional process. Few people want to defend Rhodes or either the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys. However, the First Amendment was not written to protect popular speech or popular individuals.\n\nThe Mehta order should not push President Trump toward converting these commutations into pardons. It should also not prevent us from questioning the court's authority to regulate the exercise of First Amendment rights.\n\n*  *  *\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and the author of \" The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage .\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Guilty as Hell, Free as a Bird\n\nI t is fitting that Barack Obama, who launched his political career in the living room of unrepentant domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, would conclude it by commuting another one, Oscar Lopez Rivera. After hearing the news, Ayers, on a plane coming back from Havana (where he celebrated his wife's birthday), said that he was \"dancing in the aisles.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was also a \"community organizer\" from Chicago, ran the terror operation for FALN, a Marxist organization that routinely bombed American cities in the name of Puerto Rican independence. To read about him today, one would think he was imprisoned for scribbling out revolutionary tracts. In fact, he was imprisoned for setting up \"bomb factories across the country,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nThe New York Times editorial praising Obama's decision omits any mention of that fact. It casts Lopez Rivera as a harmless political prisoner:\n\nMr. Obama also commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, a 74-year-old Puerto Rican nationalist serving 70 years for convictions including seditious conspiracy, a crime that punishes attempts to overthrow the American government. That charge vastly overstated Mr. Lopez Rivera's role in a Marxist group that carried out attacks in American cities in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe paper also omits any mention of his convictions for a planned prison break, which, if carried out, would have cost the lives of guards and other prisoners. It then, for good measure, omits his refusal to apologize for his terrorism, saying that he denied Bill Clinton's previous offer of clemency, because \"he did not want to be released unless all of his fellow defendants were freed.\"\n\nWith Ayers, Lopez Rivera can now say, \"guilty as hell, free as a bird.\" And like Ayers, his only regret is that he didn't set off more bombs. That a long line of liberal luminaries - from Pope Francis to Desmond Tutu to Jimmy Carter - lobbied for the release of a terrorist who remains proud of his terrorism tells the public all they need to know about the left's moral bankruptcy.\n\nIn commuting his sentence, Obama was tossing a parting gift to his fellow Chicago radicals, for whom the release of Lopez Rivera has long been a burning cause. Anyone wondering how Chicago became such a liberal dystopia need look no further than this priority of the Chicago political class. As the city's murder toll mounted, its pols were spending their days marching to spring a terrorist from prison.\n\nIn commuting his sentence, Obama was also fulfilling the anticolonial dreams of his father. According to that vision, minorities are entitled to use violence against the perceived inheritors of colonial powers or whomever the left deems the \"majority.\" That is the key to understanding almost every response and policy of the Obama administration, from its refusal to label jihadist terrorists to its flirtations with cop-killing militancy to its commutation of an \"anticolonial\" terrorist it now presents as an oppressed activist.\n\nOnly a president operating under that perverse moral calculus and loyal to that power politics could yawn at the bombings orchestrated by Lopez Rivera while professing shock at the \"violence\" of Trump rallies. Naturally, Obama is receiving praise for releasing a terrorist from the same leftists who claim \"fear\" at the Trump administration. They can excuse an actual bomb-maker but not the figurative ones they feverishly envision in the days ahead. One of Lopez Rivera's chief backers was Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose colleague lectured Mike Pence at a Hamilton showing:\n\n\"We, sir - we - are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.\"\n\nFor a movement that keeps such casual company with terrorists, it is easily frightened. Andrew Cuomo, New York's governor, can't wrap his mind around Trump's tweets, but he can understand Judith Clark's terrorism. At the end of 2016, he commuted her sentence, saying that the former Weather Underground domestic terrorist had exhibited \"exceptional strides in self-development.\"\n\nOne can imagine Obama blurbing (as he did one of Ayers's books) Clark's post-prison memoirs on those exceptional strides. In the radical milieu that he inhabited and to which he now returns, no one is irredeemable except conservatives.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Kinzinger, Cheney Stand Up for Stolen Elections The upside-down and backwards world of two Never Trumpers.\n\nT here they go again.\n\nRepublican Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, the two Pelosi-picked GOP members of the January 6 lynch mob committee, now have their knickers in a knot because former President Donald Trump said in a statement that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the power to \"have overturned the Election!\"\n\nKinzinger and Cheney quickly underlined - again - their opposition to investigating voter fraud in the 2020 election. Said Kinzinger :\n\n\"He could have overturned the election.\" This is an admission, and a massively un-American statement. It is time for every Republican leader to pick a side.... Trump or the Constitution, there is no middle on defending our nation anymore.\n\nCheney chimed in:\n\nTrump uses language he knows caused the Jan 6 violence; suggests he'd pardon the Jan 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election.\n\nHe'd do it all again if given the chance.\n\nThis absolute refusal by Kinzinger and Cheney to stand up for election integrity never ceases to amaze.\n\nMeanwhile, here in my home state of Pennsylvania, the state's Commonwealth Court ruled on Friday that, as reported here by the Philadelphia Inquirer , \"the state constitution requires voters to cast ballots in person unless they meet specific requirements.\"\n\nWhich is to say, many of those Pennsylvania mail-in votes cast in 2020 were, yes, illegal and unconstitutional. Yes, there is more to be heard on this, and presumably the Democratic-run State Supreme Court will overrule, doubtless setting up an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But without question, the ruling highlights that yes, indeed, Pennsylvania, a key state in 2020, had serious problems conducting an honest election.\n\nIn fact, this problem appeared yet again in a 2021 Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, judicial election, with the county refusing to certify the results as of this writing. The Blaze reported the story this way:\n\nA court ruling that undated mail-in ballots should not be counted in a local judiciary election was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Thursday, in a decision that may change the result of the race.\n\nAnd as I have documented repeatedly in this space, as here , Pennsylvania has a long history of voter fraud and corrupt elections.\n\nHad Kinzinger and Cheney been a certain federal judge in Philadelphia in 1994, there is no way this story would have made the New York Times , which headlined that, exactly as Kinzinger and Cheney flatly oppose, a Pennsylvania election was in fact overturned because of corruption. Again, the Times story begins this way:\n\nSaying Philadelphia's election system had collapsed under \"a massive scheme\" by Democrats to steal a State Senate election in November, a Federal judge today took the rare step of invalidating the vote and ordered the seat filled by the Republican candidate.\n\nIn making such a sweeping move, the judge, Clarence C. Newcomer of Federal District Court here, did for the Republicans what the election had not: enable them to regain control of the State Senate, which they lost two years ago.\n\nJudge Newcomer ruled that the Democratic campaign of William G. Stinson had stolen the election from Bruce S. Marks in North Philadelphia's Second Senatorial District through an elaborate fraud in which hundreds of residents were encouraged to vote by absentee ballot even though they had no legal reason - like a physical disability or a scheduled trip outside the city - to do so.\n\nApparently, had the judge been named not Clarence C. Newcomer but Adam Kinzinger, a Judge Kinzinger would have simply closed his eyes to what Judge Newcomer called a \"'a massive scheme' by Democrats to steal a State Senate election\" and instead would have issued an opinion that said that the call by Philadelphia State Senate candidate Bruce Marks to invalidate the vote and overturn the election was \"an admission, and a massively un-American statement. It is time for every Republican leader to pick a side.... Bruce Marks or the Constitution, there is no middle on defending our nation anymore.\"\n\nWhen you add this to the reporting of my colleague Melissa Mackenzie that the January 6 committee, as here , has subpoenaed over 100-plus American citizens, scooping up the records of \"tens of thousands of moms, children, clergy, reporters, and Republican and conservative influencers who were in touch with everyone from White House aides to prominent activists\" - all of this done with the consent of Kinzinger and Cheney - it is perfectly crystal clear who is on the side of voter integrity and the Constitution - and who is not. Additionally, Cheney has even released the private correspondence of members of the media - Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham - in a flagrant violation of the First Amendment.\n\nWhat amazes here is the chutzpah of both Kinzinger and Cheney. Turning facts upside down and inside out. Ignoring the most flagrant of examples of voter fraud right here in my own state of Pennsylvania and, in essence, saying that if you, at a minimum, have serious problems in an election, then the answer is to do nothing, deny the problem, and accuse the opponents of voter fraud who insist on respect for the Constitution of being opponents of the Constitution and voting integrity.\n\nYa can't make this stuff up.\n\nBut Kinzinger and Cheney and their fellow January 6 Committee members are trying to do just that. So let's end with an edit to the Kinzinger tweet above:\n\nIt is time for every Republican leader to pick a side.... Kinzinger and Cheney or the Constitution. There is no middle on defending our nation anymore.\n\nExactly right.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

A co-defendant - Kelly Meggs, who led the antigovernment group's Florida chapter - was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, while three other associates were cleared of that charge. Jurors found all five defendants guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding: Congress' certification of Biden's electoral victory.\n\nThe verdict, while mixed, marks a significant milestone for the Justice Department and is likely to clear the path for prosecutors to move ahead at full steam in upcoming trials of other extremists accused of sedition.\n\nRhodes and Meggs are the first people in nearly three decades to be found guilty at trial of seditious conspiracy - a rarely used Civil War-era charge that can be difficult to prove. The offense calls for up to 20 years behind bars.\n\nIt could embolden investigators, whose work has expanded beyond those who attacked the Capitol to focus on others linked to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland recently named a veteran prosecutor, Jack Smith, to serve as special counsel to oversee key aspects of a probe into efforts to subvert the election as well as a separate investigation into the retention of classified documents at Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nGarland said after the verdict that the Justice Department \"is committed to holding accountable those criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"Democracy depends on the peaceful transfer of power. By attempting to block the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, the defendants flouted and trampled the rule of law,\" Steven M. D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington Field Office, said in an emailed statement. \"This case shows that force and violence are no match for our country's justice system.\"\n\nUsing dozens of encrypted messages, recordings and surveillance video, prosecutors made the case that Rhodes began shortly after the 2020 election to prepare an armed rebellion to stop the transfer of presidential power.\n\nOver seven weeks of testimony, jurors heard how Rhodes rallied his followers to fight to defend Trump, discussed the prospect of a \"bloody\" civil war and warned the Oath Keepers may have to \"rise up in insurrection\" to defeat Biden if Trump didn't act.\n\nDefense attorneys accused prosecutors of twisting their clients' words and insisted the Oath Keepers came to Washington only to provide security for figures such as Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally. The defense focused heavily on seeking to show that Rhodes' rhetoric was just bluster and that the Oath Keepers had no plan before Jan. 6 to attack the Capitol.\n\nRhodes intends to appeal, defense attorney James Lee Bright told reporters. Another Rhodes lawyer, Ed Tarpley, described the verdict as a \"mixed bag,\" adding, \"This is not a total victory for the government in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n\"We feel like we presented a case that showed through evidence and testimony that Mr. Rhodes did not commit the crime of seditious conspiracy,\" Tarpley said.\n\nOn trial alongside Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, and Meggs, were Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy intelligence officer from Virginia; and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group.\n\nCaldwell was convicted on two counts and acquitted on three others, including seditious conspiracy. His attorney, David Fischer, called the verdict \"major victory\" for his client and a \"major defeat\" for the Justice Department. He also said he would appeal the two convictions.\n\nJury selection for a second group of Oath Keepers facing seditious conspiracy charges is scheduled to begin next week. Several members of the Proud Boys, including the former national chairman Enrique Tarrio, are also scheduled to go to trial on the sedition charge in December.\n\nIn an extraordinary move, Rhodes took the stand to tell jurors there was no plan to attack the Capitol and insist that his followers who went inside the building went rogue.\n\nRhodes testified that he had no idea that his followers were going to join the mob and storm the Capitol and said he was upset after he found out that some did. Rhodes said they were acting \"stupid\" and outside their mission for the day.\n\nProsecutors said the Oath Keepers saw an opportunity to advance their plot to stop the transfer of power and sprang into action when the mob started storming the Capitol. The Capitol attack was a \"means to an end\" for the Oath Keepers, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy told jurors in her closing argument.\n\nJurors heard how Rhodes spent thousands of dollars on an AR-platform rifle, magazines, mounts, sights and other equipment on his way to Washington ahead of the riot. They watched surveillance footage from the Virginia hotel where some Oath Keepers stashed weapons for \"quick reaction force\" teams prosecutors said were ready to get weapons into the city quickly if they were needed. The weapons were never deployed.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Oath Keepers wearing combat gear were seen on camera shouldering their way through the crowd and into the Capitol. Rhodes remained outside like a \"general surveying his troops on the battlefield,\" a prosecutor said. After the riot, Rhodes and other Oath Keepers went to an Olive Garden restaurant to celebrate, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe trial revealed new details about Rhodes' efforts to pressure Trump to fight to stay in White House in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. Shortly after the election, in a group chat that included Stone called \"FOS\" or \"Friends of Stone,\" Rhodes wrote, \"So will you step up and push Trump to FINALLY take decisive action?\"\n\nAnother man testified that after the riot, Rhodes tried to persuade him to pass along a message to Trump that urged the president not to give up his fight to hold onto power. The intermediary - a man who told jurors he had an indirect way to reach the president - recorded his meeting with Rhodes and went to the FBI instead of giving the message to Trump.\n\n\"If he's not going to do the right thing and he's just gonna let himself be removed illegally then we should have brought rifles,\" Rhodes said during that meeting, according to a recording played for jurors. \"We should have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang (expletive) Pelosi from the lamppost,\" Rhodes said, referring to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThree other Oath Keepers previously pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy. The last time the Justice Department had secured such a conviction at trial, though, was in the 1995 prosecution of Islamic militants who plotted to bomb New York City landmarks.\n\n___\n\nRicher reported from Boston.

But prosecutors say Tarrio organized and led the group's assault from afar, inspiring followers with his charisma and penchant for propaganda.\n\nTarrio was a top target in one of the most important Capitol riot cases prosecuted by the Justice Department. He and three lieutenants were convicted in May of charges including seditious conspiracy - a rarely brought Civil War-era offense that the Justice Department levied against members of far-right groups who played a key role in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"Using his powerful platform, Tarrio has repeatedly and publicly indicated that he has no regrets about what he helped make happen on January 6,\" prosecutors wrote in a court filing.\n\nThe Justice Department has also recently charged Trump with conspiring to subvert American democracy, accusing the Republican of plotting in the days before the attack to overturn the results of the election that he lost . The Tarrio case - and hundreds of others like it - function as a vivid reminder of the violent chaos fueled by Trump's lies around the election and the extent to which his false claims helped inspire right-wing extremists who ultimately stormed the Capitol to thwart the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\nTrump, who is the early front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, insists he did nothing wrong. His trial is set for March 4.\n\nThe 33-year prison sentence that prosecutors have recommended for Tarrio, 39, of Miami, is nearly twice as long as the harshest punishment that has been handed down so far in the Justice Department's massive Jan. 6 prosecution. The longest prison sentence so far went to Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes , who got 18 years for seditious conspiracy and his conviction on other charges.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly isn't bound by prosecutors' recommendation when he sentences Tarrio and separately sentences former Proud Boys chapter leader Ethan Nordean on Wednesday in Washington's federal courthouse, which sits within view of the Capitol. Later this week, Kelly is scheduled to sentence three other Proud Boys members who were convicted by a jury in May after a trial alongside Tarrio and Nordean.\n\nTarrio, Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl were convicted of seditious conspiracy. A fifth Proud Boys member, Dominic Pezzola, was acquitted of seditious conspiracy but convicted of other serious charges.\n\nProsecutors also recommended prison sentences of 33 years for Biggs, 30 years for Rehl, 27 years for Nordean and 20 years for Pezzola. Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, and Rehl, of Philadelphia, led local Proud Boys chapters. Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, was a self-described Proud Boys organizer. Pezzola was a group member from Rochester, New York.\n\nTarrio's lawyers denied the Proud Boys had any plan to attack the Capitol. They argued that prosecutors used Tarrio as a scapegoat for Trump, who spoke at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally near the White House on Jan. 6 and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\nIn urging the judge for a lenient sentence, Tarrio's lawyers noted in court papers that he has a history of cooperating with law enforcement. Court records uncovered in 2021 showed that Tarrio previously worked undercover and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012.\n\nTarrio's lawyers urged the judge \"to see another side of him - one that is benevolent, cooperative with law enforcement, useful in the community, hardworking and with a tight-knit family unit and community support.\"\n\nPolice arrested Tarrio in Washington two days before the riot on charges that he defaced a Black Lives Matter banner during an earlier rally in the nation's capital, but law enforcement officials later said he was arrested in part over concerns about the potential for unrest during the certification. He complied with a judge's order to leave the city after his arrest.\n\nOn Jan. 6, dozens of Proud Boys leaders, members and associates were among the first rioters to breach the Capitol. The mob's assault overwhelmed police, forced lawmakers to flee the House and Senate floors and disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Biden's victory.\n\nTarrio picked Nordean and Biggs to be his top lieutenants on Jan. 6 and created an encrypted Telegram group chat for group leaders to communicate, according to prosecutors. The backbone of the case against Tarrio and other Proud Boys leaders was messages that they privately exchanged before, during and after the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"Make no mistake ... we did this,\" Tarrio wrote to other group leaders.\n\nTarrio also posted encouraging messages on social media during the riot, expressing pride for what he saw unfold at the Capitol and urging his followers to stay there. He also posted a picture of rioters in the Senate chamber with the caption \"1776.\"\n\nSeveral days before the riot, a girlfriend sent Tarrio a document entitled \"1776 Returns.\" It called for storming and occupying government buildings in Washington \"for the purpose of getting the government to overturn the election results,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nMore than 1,100 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol attack. More than 600 of them have been sentenced, with over half receiving terms of imprisonment.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

While pardons were expected, the speed and the scope of the clemency amounted to a stunning dismantling of the Justice Department's effort to hold participants accountable over what has been described as one of the darkest days in the country's history.\n\nTrump also ordered the attorney general to seek the dismissal of roughly 450 cases that are still pending before judges stemming from the largest investigation in Justice Department history.\n\nCasting the rioters as \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" Trump has claimed they were unfairly treated by the Justice Department that also charged him with federal crimes in two cases he contends were politically motivated. Trump said the pardons will end \"a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years\" and begin \"a process of national reconciliation.\"\n\nThe pardons were met with elation from Trump supporters and lawyers for the Jan. 6 defendants. Trump supporters gathered late Monday in the cold outside the Washington jail, where more than a dozen defendants were being held before the pardons.\n\n\"We are deeply thankful for President Trump for his actions today,\" said James Lee Bright, an attorney who represented Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes , who was serving an 18-year prison sentence after being convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes.\n\nIt's unclear how quickly the defendants may be released from prison. An attorney for Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys national chairman who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy, said he expected his client to be released from prison Monday night.\n\n\"This marks a pivotal moment in our client's life, and it symbolizes a turning point for our nation,\" attorney Nayib Hassan said in a statement. \"We are optimistic for the future, as we now turn the page on this chapter, embracing new possibilities and opportunities.\"\n\nDemocrats slammed the move to extend the pardons to violent rioters, many of whose crimes were captured on camera and broadcast on live TV. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it \"an outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is ushering in a Golden Age for people that break the law and attempt to overthrow the government,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in an emailed statement.\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone , who lost consciousness and suffered a heart attack after a rioter shocked him with a stun gun , appeared taken aback to learn from an Associated Press reporter that those who assaulted police officers are among the pardon recipients.\n\n\"This is what the American people voted for,\" he said. \"How do you react to something like that?\"\n\nFanone said he has spent the past four years worried about his safety and the well-being of his family. Pardoning his assailants only compounds his fears, he said.\n\n\"I think they're cowards,\" he said. \"Their strength was in their numbers and the mob mentality. And as individuals, they are who they are.\"\n\nTrump had suggested in the weeks leading up to his return to the White House that instead of blanket pardons, he would look at the Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. And Vice President JD Vance had said just days ago that people responsible for the violence during the Capitol riot \"obviously\" should not be pardoned .\n\nFourteen defendants, including several convicted of seditious conspiracy, had their sentences commuted, while the rest of those found guilty of Jan. 6 crimes were granted \"full, complete and unconditional\" pardons.\n\nThe pardons come weeks after the Justice Department abandoned its two federal criminal cases against Trump, citing its policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Had Trump lost the 2024 election, he may have ultimately stood trial on charges in the same federal courthouse in Washington in the case that had accused him of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss in a desperate bid to cling to power.\n\nMore than 1,200 people across the U.S. had been convicted of Jan. 6 crimes over the last four years, including roughly 200 people who pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement.\n\nHundreds of Jan. 6 defendants who didn't engage in any of the violence and destruction were charged with misdemeanor trespassing offenses, and many of those served little to no time behind bars.\n\nBut the violence that day has been documented extensively through videos, testimony and other evidence seen by judges and jurors in the courthouse that its within view of the Capitol.\n\nPolice were dragged into the crowd and beaten. Rioters used makeshift weapons to attack police, including flagpoles, a crutch and a hockey stick. Investigators documented a number of firearms in the crowd, along with knives, a pitchfork, a tomahawk ax, brass knuckle gloves and other weapons. Officers have described in testimony fearing for their lives as members of the mob hurled insults and obscenities at them.\n\nOf the more than 1,500 people charged, about 250 people were convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial, while more than 1,000 others had pleaded guilty to offenses. Only two people were acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully acquitted a Capitol riot defendant.\n\nMore than 1,000 rioters had been sentenced, with over 700 receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some combination of probation, community service, home detention or fines.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that not all of the defendants who had sentences commuted were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "WSJ Editorial Board Shoots Down Legal Theory to Keep Donald Trump off Ballot\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Editorial Board has come out in opposition to the growing Never Trump legal theory that secretaries of state and other state officials could block former President Donald Trump from their states' presidential ballots using Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAt the crux of the anti-Trump legal scholars' argument is their claim that Trump partook in an insurrection on January 6, 2021. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment outlines that one who incites an insurrection is barred from holding office, though there is debate about whether the statute applies to the president and vice president, as Breitbart News Senior Editor Joel Pollak and the Washington Examiner's Byron York have pointed out.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal describes the events of January 6 as a \"riot\" and an \"obstruction of a federal proceeding\" and noted the \"1970s were rife\" with political riots, \"including bombings of government buildings.\" However, January 6 did not rise to an insurrection or a rebellion in the WSJ board's view, and a major weakness in the argument is that none of the federal charges levied against Trump allege an insurrection or seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"Does anyone think special prosecutor Jack Smith would have refrained from charging that crime if he believed he could prove it in court?\" The board wondered. \"Instead he has charged a conspiracy to overturn the election, but that is not a rebellion.\"\n\nWhile New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan (R) and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) have indicated they are weighing arguments Trump should be disqualified, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin called on other secretaries of state to do the same last week:\n\nThe first step must be a recognition that the 14th Amendment is relevant and demands fidelity from all officials who take an oath to defend the Constitution. As Luttig and Tribe wrote , \"Section 3 is no anachronism or relic from the past; rather, it applies with the same force and effect today as it did the day it was ratified - as does every other provision, clause, and word of the Constitution that has not been repealed or revised by amendment.\"\n\nNow, secretaries of state and other officials must grapple with how to make the determination. Does state law require they obtain a ruling from the state attorney general or other legal official? Do they conduct open hearings to provide transparency and educate voters? There are no easy answers because we have never witnessed the accused instigator of an attempted insurrection run for president. And though Trump is not yet the nominee, it would be reckless not to prepare for the strong likelihood that Republican primary voters will nominate their cult leader.\n\nAlthough Benson acknowledged listening to arguments for using the Fourteenth Amendment while appearing on MSNBC's Deadline: White House in August, she brought up concerns surrounding due process, considering Trump has not been convicted of a crime.\n\n\"If we're not going to predicate this on conviction under the law, then what and how do we ensure due process? How do we define insurrection or rebellion? Who makes that determination?\" asked Benson. She added state officials must be \"very careful in making decisions not from a political standpoint but from a legal standpoint.\"\n\nThe Journal's editorial board emphasized that removing Trump without a conviction would violate his rights to due process and open the door to allegations against those who take him off the ballot of a conspiracy against rights:\n\nThis would seem to violate the due-process protections that are explicit elsewhere in the Constitution. Removing Mr. Trump by fiat would also deny voters the constitutional right to vote for the candidate of their choice. See Reynolds v. Sims (1964), among other precedents. This is precisely the right that Mr. Smith, the special prosecutor, accuses Mr. Trump of violating. Democrats would arguably be committing the same offense.\n\nMoreover, some courts have ruled that this Disqualifications Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not self-executing, meaning that Congress must enact a law setting up the process to disqualify citizens under Section 3. Congress has never passed such a law.\n\nElection law expert Hans von Spakovsky at the Heritage Foundation, who formerly served as a member of the Federal Elections Commission, and before that as a lawyer in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, raises yet another objection. He explains that Congress passed two amnesty acts for citizens who would have been disqualified under Section 3, one in 1872 and another broader amnesty in 1898, and argues that these two federal laws have completely nullified what would otherwise be the force of the Disqualifications Clause.\n\nRemoving Trump from the ballot would further fan the flames of political divide among Americans, in the Journal's view. A CNN poll last month found that 69 percent of Republicans do not think Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, and removing the leading Republican presidential candidate would likely further tarnish GOP voters' faith in the electoral system.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Joshua James, a 34-year-old military veteran who led the group's Alabama chapter, pleaded guilty to the same charges last month.\n\nBoth Ulrich and James - from of Arab, Ala. - have agreed to cooperate with the government's ongoing investigation as part of their plea agreements.\n\nThe nine remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nUlrich admitted as part of his guilty plea that he conspired for months with other Oath Keepers to obstruct \"the transfer of presidential power,\" and they \"were prepared to use force to stop the transfer of power,\" the Justice Department statement said.\n\nThe plotting included \"encrypted and private communications,\" and gathering weapons, including \"combat and tactical gear,\" according to the Justice Department statement.\n\nThe statement added that Ulrich and other Oath Keepers used a group chat application called \"Signal\" where he encouraged others in his chapter to join him in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I seriously wonder what it would take just to get every patriot marching around the capital armed?\" Ulrich questioned in \"Signal\" chat on Dec. 5, 2020, the statement noted.\n\nUlrich added that the point was \"to show our government how powerless they are!\"\n\nIn another chat, Ulrich messaged the group that a \"Civil War\" may be necessary if Biden became president.\n\n\"And if there's a Civil War then there's a Civil War,\" Ulrich added.\n\nUlrich breached a restricted area in military \"stack\" formation with hands on shoulders and tactical gear, and entered the Capital building at 3:22 p.m., the Justice Department statement said.\n\nHe was arrested on Aug. 9, 2021, in Guyton, Ga, and faces up to 20 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and up to 20 years for obstruction of an official proceeding, along with potential financial penalties. A sentencing date has not been scheduled yet.\n\nSince Jan. 6, 2021, nearly 800 individuals have been arrested nationwide for crimes related to the Capitol breach, including over 250 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.\n\nInvestigation remains ongoing.\n\nJon Schaffer, a founding lifetime member of the Oath Keepers, was not charged with seditious conspiracy, but pleaded guilty last spring to breaching the Capitol in a tactical vest armed with bear repellant, to obstruct Congress' certification of Biden's election win.

Rhodes has yet to get into the details of Jan. 6, when his followers pushed through a mob of Trump supporters to storm the Capitol in military-style stack formation.\n\nRhodes, wearing a dark suit and tie, faced jurors as he described his military experience and decision to start the Oath Keepers in 2009. Rhodes, whose stint as an Army paratrooper was cut short by a training accident, said he considers himself a patriotic person.\n\n\"You love your country?\" Rhodes' attorney asked him.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Rhodes responded.\n\nRhodes portrayed the Oath Keepers as peaceful and disciplined despite a mountain of evidence showing him rallying his band of extremists to prepare for violence and discussing the prospect of a \"bloody\" civil war ahead of Jan. 6. Asked whether he believed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, Rhodes falsely described Biden's victory as \"unconstitutional\" and \"invalid.\"\n\n\"You really can't have a winner of an unconstitutional election,\" Rhodes said.\n\nRhodes' trial is the biggest test so far for the Justice Department's efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the attack on the Capitol, a violent assault that challenged the foundations of American democracy.\n\nRhodes, of Granbury, Texas, and his co-defendants are the first people arrested in the Jan. 6 attack to stand trial on the charge of seditious conspiracy. The Civil War-era charge, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years behind bars upon conviction, is rarely brought and can be hard to prove.\n\nThe others on trial are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia; and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group.\n\nOver a month of testimony, prosecutors sought to show that the riot for the Oath Keepers was not a spur-of-the-moment protest but part of a serious, weekslong plot to stop the transfer of power.\n\nRhodes' attorneys have signaled they will mount a novel defense with Trump at the center. Rhodes is expected to argue that his actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, were in anticipation of orders he expected from Trump. Those orders never came.\n\nJurors have heard that Rhodes spent thousands of dollars on guns, ammunition and other equipment before Jan. 6, and that Oath Keepers stashed a massive cache of weapons referred to as a \"quick reaction force\" at a Virginia hotel.\n\nThe weapons were never deployed. In a meeting with another man days after the riot, Rhodes was secretly recorded saying the Oath Keepers \" should have brought rifles \" on Jan. 6.\n\n\"We should have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang (expletive) Pelosi from the lamppost,\" Rhodes said, referring to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOn the stand Friday, Rhodes described Oath Keepers' events in the fall of 2020 before the election. After the election, he issued a \"call to action\" for the \"Million MAGA March\" in Washington on Nov. 14. Oath Keepers provided security for event speakers and Trump supporters who asked for their help, Rhodes said.\n\nRhodes said the Oath Keepers provided security at Trump rallies, with unarmed members inside the security perimeter and armed members on standby outside to escort Trump supporters and protect them from possible attacks from antifa activists.\n\nHe tripped up at one point when discussing protests, some which turned violent, after George Floyd's 2020 killing. Rhodes said he supports \"their right to riot\" before quickly correcting himself to say he supports their right to protest, not riot.\n\nRhodes got emotional at times during his testimony. He appeared to choke up as he recalled watching the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack unfold on TV while he was a student at Yale Law School, and as he talked about how military veterans often come home and struggle to find a new purpose for their lives.\n\nThe portrayal of the Oath Keepers as disciplined contrasts with testimony on Thursday about Rhodes' leadership during the Million MAGA March in November of 2020. Watkins' fiancé, Montana Siniff, described it as \"very disorganized\" and told jurors he did not himself return to Washington on Jan. 6 in part because he did not want to \"repeat that experience.\"\n\nProsecutors say Rhodes began plotting to overturn Biden's victory as early as November 2020. Messages shown to jurors show him calling on his followers to fight to defend Trump and keep Biden out of the White House at all costs.\n\nHowever, defense attorneys say there was no plan to attack the Capitol. The Oath Keepers say they were in Washington on Jan. 6 not to stop the certification of Biden's win but to provide security for right-wing figures such as Roger Stone. Their attorneys argue the Oath Keepers regularly had a \"quick reaction force\" for events but the weapons were meant to be used only to defend against attacks or if Trump invoked the Insurrection Act.\n\nRhodes' attorneys have said that his defense will focus on his belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act to call up a militia and put down what the extremist group leader viewed as a coup by Democrats.\n\nRhodes repeatedly called on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, but Trump never did. Rhodes' lawyers say he cannot be found guilty of seditious conspiracy because he was merely lobbying Trump to invoke the law, which gives the president wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary and what qualifies as military force.\n\nProsecutors are expected to highlight messages they say show that Rhodes was using the Insurrection Act as legal cover and was prepared to act regardless of what Trump did. In one message in December 2020, Rhodes wrote that Trump \"needs to know that if he fails to act, then we will.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage related to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"
