      "text": "By asking if Biden is responsible for Roe's fall, the Times misinforms the public\n\nAll right. I'm sorry. I have to say that in advance. I'm going to write about the Times again . What it did is too important to overlook.\n\nWhat did the Times do? One of the questions in that recent Times poll I was telling you about yesterday , the one about Donald Trump being ahead of Joe Biden in five critical swing states, was about abortion.\n\nSpecifically, the question was about who's more responsible for the end of Roe and national abortion rights: Is it Trump or Biden?\n\nIt's a trick question, and the pollster asking that trick question should have told the person on the phone just kidding just kidding - Biden had nothing to do with it. It was all Trump. It was he who appointed the justices who struck down Roe . Indeed, he's taken responsibility for it.\n\nIt's not an open question. It's not a debate. Who's responsible is settled . Trumps says he did it. Joe Biden says he did. Anti-abortionists credit Trump. Abortion-rights defenders credit Trump. Everyone who's participated in abortion discourse knows who did what to whom.\n\nIt may be the closest we'll get to a national consensus on anything.\n\nYet the Times decided to wonder and the results are as expected.\n\nImportantly, the Times knows the answer to the question. The Times knows the answer is black-and-white, conclusive, falsifiable, not a matter of argument or interpretation. The Times knows there are not two sides to this story. Yet in asking the question, it invented sides.\n\nWhat happens when people who know better pretend they don't know better by asking whether an actual closed question is actually open?\n\nPeople who really don't know better come to the mistaken belief that it's open. The result, in this case, is that 12 percent of Democrats believe Joe Biden is responsible for the end of national abortion rights.\n\nShould these Democrats know better? Yes! But that's not the point.\n\nThe point is they don't. They don't pay attention. The most attention they have given to any politics of any kind was when the Times called that morning to ask who's more responsible for the end of Roe .\n\nAnd because they don't pay attention to politics of any kind, they probably figure it must be an open question, otherwise the Times wouldn't be asking. And in that moment, instead of informing citizens on important public affairs, the Times ends up misinforming them.\n\nWould 12 percent of Democrats, most of them supporters of abortion rights, say Biden is more responsible than Trump for the end of Roe if the Times stopped pretending it didn't know what it actually knows?\n\nI doubt it.\n\nYou could say people who are not paying attention to politics merely believe Biden is responsible because it happened on his watch. That may be true but, again, that's beside the point. The point isn't whether citizens should know things. They should! But they often don't! And that ignorance is why we need a free press - to educate the public.\n\nThe Times could have relieved these Democrats of their ignorance. Instead, it deepened it by validating it. Moreover, it humiliated them for it. For instance, instead of telling a 62-year-old abortion-rights supporter in Las Vegas that she was mistaken, it let her say that Biden \"had the ability to fight\" the Supreme Court. Then it named her .\n\nJust to be clear: the president could do nothing to stop a rightwing supermajority determined to cut the social standing of half the country in half. But, again, the point isn't that lots of people don't know how government works. The point is that the most influential news organization in the country does know but pretends not to, and in the process of pretending humiliates citizens whom it's failing to educate.\n\n(These are not just pollsters making contact. Times reporters later reached out to poll respondents for interviews. Those would have been ideal moments for civic edification, but evidently, they were wasted.)\n\nThis isn't just some academic beef. When the news organizations like the Times pretend they don't know better, the consequences can be dire. The 62-year-old abortion-rights supporter in Las Vegas, the one who thought Biden could have fought the Supreme Court, said that now, because Biden didn't defend abortion rights, she might not vote.\n\nOthers quoted in the Times story were similarly affected by the Times ' makebelieve. One of them thought Biden could have done more to stop states from passing anti-abortion laws. (He couldn't.). One thought Biden \"made empty promises.\" (He didn't.) One said Biden's age \"prevented him from closely tracking\" state-level anti-abortion laws. (Laughable.) Another said \"Biden did not fully criticize or condemn the taking away of people's rights.\" (Ha!) Another said \"he doesn't say much about it anymore.\" (It's central to his campaign.)\n\nPerhaps most troubling is that the Times does not correct these misconceptions even for the sake of its own readers. The report just lets them slide, as if they were true, potentially compounding the public's ignorance of the president's record as well as his capacities.\n\nThere's a reason why some say the Times has contempt for ordinary people. It's because the Times has contempt for ordinary people."

      "text": "'There's very few people that are celebrating': Joe Rogan shuts down JD Vance's Roe claim\n\nSen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) recently sat down with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, and one particular exchange is turning heads on social media.\n\nWhile Rogan and Vance were discussing how the Supreme Court's 2022 overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision could impact next week's presidential election, the comedian and Ultimate Fighting Championship commentator observed that the \"concept and the zeitgeist is that abortion had always been, you know, Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, and then all of a sudden that was taken away and you have these religious men trying to dictate what women can and can't do with their bodies.\"\n\nVance responded that he understood \"the pushback against that,\" but countered that \"you could go with so many other issues.\" He opined that \"you can go way too far about it.\"\n\n\"It becomes trying to celebrate something that at the very best, if you grant, I think, every argument of the pro-choice side, it is a neutral thing, not something to be celebrated,\" Vance added.\n\n\"I think there's very few people that are celebrating, though,\" Rogan responded.\n\nThe exchange is somewhat surprising, given that Rogan's podcast is known for its long-winded, hours-long episodes in which Rogan allows his guests to speak at length and rarely challenges them. He's also a political wild card, having voted for neither former President Donald Trump nor President Joe Biden in 2020. Newsweek reported that Rogan voted for libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen, though he admitted she \"didn't have a shot\" of winning in California, where he was registered at the time (Rogan now lives in Austin, Texas).\n\nDespite his popularity among young men who are predominantly supporters of Trump and Vance, Rogan wasn't shy about expressing his admiration for Vice President Kamala Harris in a September episode of his podcast that aired after Harris and Trump's ABC News debate in September. While talking to comedian Tom Segura, Rogan opined that Harris was \" nailing it .\"\n\n\"They did an amazing job from the moment Biden drops out, forcing Biden to drop out, whatever they're doing, whoever's writing those speeches, getting her to deliver them, coaching her, she's nailing it,\" Rogan said. \"The difference in that debate was not a difference in who's going to have better policies, who's going to be better for the country. The difference in the debate, in my opinion, was who was better prepared.\"\n\nWatch the video of Rogan's exchange with Vance below, or by clicking this link ."

      "text": "'A climate of fear': Roe's fall has triggered bipartisan radicalization\n\nOn Monday, I recommended putting \"democracy is on the ballot\" in the background of the 2024 election and putting in the foreground concrete objectives - namely, abortion rights - that can only be achieved via democratic politics. My point was about campaign messaging by Democratic candidates, as if the choice were theirs.\n\nBut circumstances have a way of changing things.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court ruled last week that a pregnant woman, whose baby had virtually no chance of surviving due to a genetic disorder, did not qualify for an exception to the state's abortion ban. (She fled the state to get the procedure.) Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court accepted a case that could restrict access to mifepristone , the so-called abortion pill. And next year, voters in nearly a dozen states could enshrine abortion rights through constitutional amendments. These include states that will be pivotal to the presidential election.\n\nGiven this, my recommendation to put abortion rights in the foreground, and \"democracy is on the ballot\" in the background, seems shortsighted. The wheels are already in motion. Whether Joe Biden and the Democrats insist that \"democracy is on the ballot\" is probably beside the point, because you know what? Abortion rights sure are.\n\nThe ruling by the high court of Texas exposed a major weakness in antiabortion politics - that there was never a genuine intention of allowing for medical exceptions to total or near-total abortion bans. \"The main takeaway here is that these exceptions are really meaningless in practice, especially when you have political actors who are dedicated to going after abortion,\" said Cathren Cohen, an attorney with the UCLA Law Center on Reproductive Health, Law and Policy.\n\nThe Texas case is certainly the first of many. Pregnant women across antiabortion states are going to challenge medical exceptions in increasing numbers. The buildup will probably spill over into the Supreme Court's ruling in the mifepristone case, which is expected in June of next year, right when the presidential election is getting hot.\n\nBeneath it all is a groundswell of activity to put abortion rights in front of voters in ballot initiatives. The objective is protecting access by way of state constitutional amendments. Proponents beat attempts to strip abortions rights in Kansas and Kentucky. They succeeded in passing constitutional amendments in Michigan, California, Vermont and Ohio. Next up in abortion-rights protections are Maryland and New York with the possible inclusion of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Florida, Missouri, Arkansas and South Dakota.\n\nDonald Trump and the Republicans should be worried. The thing about these ballot initiatives is that they motivate people to get educated, participate, contribute and vote - ultimately to the benefit of the presidential candidate who is most aligned with the cause.\n\nIn 2004, when more than a dozen states asked voters to approve laws banning same-sex marriage, turn out was huge compared to states that did not offer referendums. According to numerous studies, these ballot measures helped George W. Bush get reelected, because they mobilized voters in ways that ordinary campaign politics didn't.\n\nI might be right in saying that \"democracy is on the ballot\" should be put in the background of the 2024 presidential election. But it's already in the background, and effective messaging had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe fall of Roe has radicalized people who would not normally act radically. It has mobilized them in ways unseen in decades. And it is a bipartisan radicalization . As Laura Chapin , a Democratic strategist who specializes in abortion, told me, the antiabortionists in the Republican Party are far behind their own supporters on this.\n\n\"Republican and independent voters have always been ahead of Republican politicians on this, because it fundamentally comes down to the value of keeping government and politicians out of your private business, something most people support regardless of party ID.\"\n\nJS: Can you explain, in legal and political terms, why exceptions to abortion bans, like the one in Texas, don't seem to allow for exceptions?\n\nLC: Because, as the folks at Patient Forward put it, you can't legislate away bad pregnancy outcomes. Medical science doesn't work that way, and no doctor is going to take the risk of jail time in the hopes the courts will look benevolently upon their providing an abortion.\n\nA 13-year-old girl in Mississippi gave birth, because even though that state's ban had a rape exception, there were no providers left in the state and no legal means for her to obtain an exception in any event.\n\nExceptions to abortion bans are predicated on the political judgment that an abortion has to be earned - that if the person has been traumatized enough, then they have earned the right to an abortion. If they haven't, however, they should be forced to give birth.\n\nJS: I find it stunning when antiabortionists say they don't want abortion to be adjudicated democratically. One of them told Politico : \"We don't believe those rights should be subjected to majority vote.\" Is it just me?\n\nLC: Abortion rights and voting rights are inherently tied together. It's inherently undemocratic to block a vote on an issue that you know you're probably going to lose. Gerrymandering is how red states pass unpopular abortion bans, and the Supreme Court itself overturned Roe thanks in part to a seat Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell stole.\n\nJS: Some antiabortion states are talking about preventing people from leaving to have abortions. Does the abortion crackdown trend have the potential of becoming a freedom of movement controversy?\n\nLC: Whether or not they're broadly legal, the point of these state laws is to intimidate people who already face barriers to abortion care from seeking help. It's to create a climate of fear - literally to scare someone into thinking that if they get in a car and drive to New Mexico or Colorado, they'll have a trooper following them.\n\nJS: SCOTUS has accepted the mifepristone case. Any predictions?\n\nLC: At this point, they're looking at the expansion of mifepristone access, not the approval itself. As Jessica Valenti put it , \"the legality of mifepristone shouldn't be at risk, but access and availability of the medication is.\" But any restrictions on access make it harder for people in abortion ban states to access care, which again is the point of the antiabortion movement - to create a climate of fear and intimidation.\n\nJS: I have a pet theory. It's that swing voters switched from lean-R to lean-D after SCOTUS struck down Roe . Is there anything to that?\n\nLC: I have some insight into this as a veteran of abortion ban ballot measures in Colorado dating back to 2008 - and we've won every time thanks not just to Democrats but to \"unaffiliateds\" (the largest voting bloc here) and Republicans voting in support of keeping access.\n\nRepublican and Independent voters have always been ahead of Republican politicians on this, because it fundamentally comes down to the value of keeping government and politicians out of your private business, something most people support regardless of party ID.\n\nAnd as Republican politicians are now finding out, you can absolutely have an abortion for a wanted pregnancy and being denied one for politics has horrifying and heartbreaking consequences."

      "text": "How overturning Roe v. Wade led to the Supreme Court's 'obvious departure from collegiality of years past'\n\nOver the years, for the most part, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) have maintained amicable interpersonal relationships with one another. But after the reign of former president Donald Trump, and with an increasingly conservative Supreme Court panel of judges, that has changed.\n\nSteven Mazie, SCOTUS correspondent at The Economist , recently reflected on his last ten years of covering Supreme Court cases in an op-ed for The Atlantic , in which he highlights the drastic shift in the working relationship between the justices.\n\nHaving observed oral arguments since 2013, Mazie has gained an understanding of the outward appearance of the justices' dynamics over time. From the sustained camaraderie between former Justice Stephen Breyer and current Justice Clarence Thomas despite their moral differences, to the assistance Justice Thomas would offer to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her declining health, the justices always remained on good terms.\n\nEven through disagreements over a church-state case, same-sex marriage, the Affordable Care Act, voting rights, labor unions and abortion, it became clear to Mazie that, no matter the circumstances or differences of opinion, \"peace prevailed\" and \"civility reigned.\"\n\nHowever, that seemed to change once Roe v. Wade was overturned following the leak of Justice Alito's opinion in June 2022. Not only has the friendly relationship between the justices become noticeable for onlookers, but according to Mazie, the justices are \"sometimes bordering on disrespect.\"\n\nAlthough not apparent every day, the panel of justices have developed a tension that was not there before Trump tipped the court further right.\n\n\"The Supreme Court that Donald Trump reshaped isn't simply more conservative; it's also much more strained,\" Mazie wrote, adding that the nine justices are now charged with navigating a relationship of which any \"manager would be concerned.\"\n\nThe tension on the Court continued past the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June and carried on throughout the summer and fall. The Court is currently facing charges that question its legitimacy following the Roe v. Wade opinion leak . And, as the court becomes more \"partisan\" in its rulings, Justice Elena Kagan recently said \"Americans are bound to lose confidence in a Court that looks 'like an extension of the political process.'\" In staunch disagreement of questions surroudning the Court's legitimacy, Justice Samuel Alito has claimed that anyone who says SCOTUS is \"becoming an illegitimate institution\" is questioning the justices' \"integrity\".\n\nAs the justices reckon with their relationship in the courtroom, the \"worry\" around their \"fractured relationships\" remains pressing. Afterall,  the rights of millions of Americans are at stake."

      "text": "New Biden campaign ad puts focus on Trump's role in overturning Roe v. Wade\n\nAs part of its $50 million July ad push, President Joe Biden's reelection campaign is releasing a new ad Monday that focuses on former President Donald Trump's role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade.\n\nViewed by the Capital-Star ahead of its wider release, the 30-second spo t, titled \"Her Own,\" uses Trump's comments from the June 27 presidential debate, where he called appointing the justices who helped \"kill\" Roe v. Wade \"a great thing.\" It will run on digital TV in battleground states.\n\nHer Own | Biden-Harris 2024 www.youtube.com\n\n\"Ask yourself, who do you want in the White House: The man proud to overturn Roe v. Wade, or the President fighting for your rights?\" the voiceover asks.\n\nA screen capture from the new Biden campaign ad \"Her Own.\"\n\nThe issue of abortion access has been energizing for the Democratic base, but Biden gave somewhat confusing answers to questions about abortion and Roe v. Wade during the debate . The campaign has tried to demonstrate the consequences of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision for women who have had to navigate the new patchwork of state abortion laws to receive care.\n\n\"If Trump is reelected, he will go even further - punishing women who receive an abortion, banning abortion nationwide, and carrying out the rest of the extreme Project 2025 agenda,\" campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement Monday. \"The only thing standing between American women and Trump's cruel attacks on reproductive health care is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"\n\nWhile he has boasted about appointing the three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, Trump said during the debate he believes in abortion ban exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But in February he reportedly expressed support for a nationwide abortion ban, and during an interview with a Pittsburgh TV news station in May, Trump hinted that he might be open to states limiting or banning access to contraception, though he walked back his remarks the same day in a social media post.\n\nThe new Biden campaign ad also seeks to continue its focus on linking Trump to Project 2025 , , a conservative policy proposal that would, among other things, hinder abortion and contraception access . Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 in a social media post last week.\n\nThe ad comes as Biden brushes aside suggestions he should step aside as Democrats' presumptive 2024 nominee, after his shaky debate performance. The president campaigned in Pennsylvania on Sunday , speaking at a church in Philadelphia and a union gathering in Harrisburg as he tried to reassure voters he was up to the job.\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak in Pennsylvania on Saturday at a rally in Butler, north of Pittsburgh, two days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nPennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "The Roe backlash is real. And, as they say, it is spectacular\n\nPeople are pissed about the Supreme Court unceremoniously overturning Roe . Now we're seeing just how pissed they are.\n\nOrganizers behind Michigan's Reproductive Freedom for All proposal report that they've already collected over 800,000 signatures, nearly double the 425,059 needed by July 15 to get the measure on the ballot - a Michigan record for a ballot initiative .\n\nIf approved, this proposal would amend that state's Constitution to sup1931 law that banned abortion until Roe came along.\n\nAnd more importantly, it would send a message to the enemies of reproductive rights everywhere - be afraid. Right now, you're looking upon your works. You should despair.\n\nA ten-year-old rape victim forced to flee her home . Doctors fearing prison if they decide to save a patient from an ectopic pregnancy. Red state politicians salivating at being able to hunt anyone seeking an abortion by preventing them from crossing state lines .\n\nFor now, you're getting exactly what you wanted.\n\nBut voters won't rest until the rights Roe guaranteed are restored.\n\nThe popularity of this measure also confirms something that should be obvious to anyone who pays attention to politics - Michigan is the model for resisting autocracy.\n\nYou may say that I'm a little too proud of my adopted home state. You might also say I'm overcompensating for the shame of my state of having helped elect Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nYou would be right. But so am I.\n\nLike Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Michigan responded to the realization that they'd put a Putinist in the White House by electing Democrats to key statewide offices, including governor, in 2018.\n\nBut the Mitten took the extra step of passing two ballot measures that helped undo some of the damage done to voting rights.\n\nProposal 2 gave the state one of the best approaches to ending gerrymandering in the nation. Proposal 3 expanded ballot access dramatically by, among many other things, giving every Michigander the option to vote by mail.\n\nBoth proposals passed with more than 61 percent support. Both were more popular than the measure legalizing weed, which also passed.\n\nMaking it easier to vote helped Michigan reject Trump in 2020 by 146,000 votes, more than 10-times his margin of victory in 2016.\n\nThanks to our new fair maps, Democrats have a chance to win back the state Senate for the first time since 1984 along with the state House, which has been in GOP hands most of the last decade.\n\nThis would not only give Governor Gretchen Whitmer a chance to actually govern in 2023, it would prevent what is shaping up as the GOP's plan to steal key swing states in 2024 by using gerrymandered legislatures to overrule voters.\n\nIncreased voting rights and fair maps are the simplest way to fight back at the attrition of democracy that made Trump possible. And to be fair, I have to note that Michigan has a huge advantage in achieving these goals over many states, including our fellow bricks in the Blue Wall - Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nPennsylvanians need the state legislature to approve a measure before it can go on their ballot. And the GOP-controlled, gerrymandered-for-their-pleasure state House in the Keystone State will never do anything like that to risk their power or ability to help elect Trump or a Trump impersonator.\n\nIn Wisconsin, you need the measure to pass two consecutive legislatures to pass a ballot measure that would modify the state Constitution. Something that will never happen because the state is, at this point, barely a democracy .\n\nBut Michigan's unique ability to fight for democracy makes it more important to the rest of the nation, not less.\n\nIf Michigan's Reproductive Freedom for All passes in the nation's third most important swing state with nearly two-thirds of voters supporting it, as I imagine it will, this will send a message to the rest of the nation.\n\nThat message will be loud and it will resonate much in the same way that Mallory McMorrow's righteous speech calling out Republican BS did. And hopefully it will embolden weak-kneed Democrats to stand up on an issue where voters overwhelmingly and clearly oppose Republican BS.\n\nIt will say, we're sick of your shit and we're not going to take it anymore. Yes, this isn't enough, given the depths and depravity of the threats to our rights and democracy we face.\n\nBut it's definitely a start."

      "text": "If the Supreme Court shoots down Roe v. Wade, there could be an all-out assault on gay rights\n\nAfter decades of longing for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973, anti-abortion zealots may finally get their wish. The High Court, on December 1, began hearing oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - a case that is examining the constitutionality of a highly restrictive anti-abortion law in Mississippi. If the Court upholds the Mississippi law, overturns Roe and assaults abortion rights, there is every reason to believe that gay rights won't be far behind.\n\nThat is not to say that Dobbs deals with gay rights per se. Dobbs is about abortion specifically, and defenders of the Mississippi law are arguing that the Roe decision was an attack on states' rights - that the state government in Mississippi, not the federal government, should be able to decide how it governs and regulates abortion. But legal experts, including Laurence Tribe , have pointed out that if the High Court doesn't respect abortion as a national right, it won't respect gay liberties as a national right either.\n\nAlthough Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the United States' last eight presidential elections, the Supreme Court now has six justices appointed by Republican presidents and only three justices nominated by Democratic presidents. This is the most hard-right Supreme Court in generations, and the Dobbs case is almost certain to end with Roe being overturned - or at the very least, gutted. Even if Chief Justice John Roberts votes with the three Democratic nominees, the end of Roe appears likely.\n\nOverturning Roe will not amount to a national abortion ban, but rather, would allow abortion rights to be decided on a state-by-state basis. So post- Roe , abortion would likely be banned in a long list of red states while remaining legal in blue states like California, Oregon and Massachusetts. And that would affect gay rights because the Christian Right and its lawyers would argue that if a 48-year-old precedent like Roe can be overturned, there is no reason why gay rights rulings should not be overturned as well.\n\nIn fact, Tribe, co-founder of the American Constitution Society, specifically discussed gay rights during a December 1 appearance on Lawrence O'Donnell's MSNBC show, explaining why the end of Roe will lead to a variety of assaults on civil liberties.\n\nTribe - whose students, over the years, have ranged from President Barack Obama to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to Chief Justice Roberts - told O'Donnell, \"All along, we have expanded rights. Brown v. Broad expanded rights beyond what Plessy had said. Lawrence v. Texas expanded rights for LGBT people. We've expanded. But if we do now what the Court is poised to do, it will be the first turnaround. We will have lost our virginity basically. And once we do it this time, it's going to be a lot easier to do it next time with contraception , with same-sex marriage, with gun rights, for example. Rights that conservatives like, rights that liberals like. It's always been a matter of expanding rights; this will be the first reversal of that trend.\"\n\nLawrence v. Texas , a 2003 Supreme Court ruling, was a major victory for gay rights because it struck down a sodomy law in Texas as unconstitutional - and by doing so, the Court struck down sodomy laws in other states as well. Hated by the Christian Right, Lawrence was, like Roe , what legal scholars call a right-to-privacy decision . Far-right social conservatives believe there is no right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution, while liberal and progressive groups like the ACLU and People for the American Way - as well as some right-wing libertarians such as former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy - believe that there is.\n\nThe right-to-privacy argument also prevailed in Obergefell v. Hodges , the 2015 High Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Just as Roe established a national standard for abortion rights, Lawrence and Obergefell set national standards with gay rights - Lawrence for sexual activities, Obergefell for the right of same-sex couples to get married.\n\nIf Roe falls, it will give the Christian Right hope that Lawrence and Obergefell can be overturned as well. Post- Roe , the Christian Right argument for overturning those decisions will be along the lines of: \"the Court has decided that Roe was wrongly decided in 1973, and that individual states must decide for themselves whether or not to have legal abortion - so why should there be a national standard for gay rights? The High Court has struck down Roe as unconstitutional, and applying that standard, Lawrence and Obergefell must be struck down as well.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Justice Samuel Alito and other social conservatives who are likely to vote to overturn Roe would likely vote to overturn Lawrence and Obergefell as well.\n\nRight-wing jurists, in some cases, can turn out to be highly protective of civil liberties. Anthony Kennedy, a right-wing Ronald Reagan appointee, was fiscally conservative during his decades on the High Court, but he often sided with the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when it came to abortion and gay rights. The current leaning of the Court, however, is more in the direction of Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia - that is, Christian Right conservative rather than libertarian/Cato Institute/Reason Magazine conservative.\n\nIf Roe v. Wade is overturned, the Christian Right assault on civil liberties will not end with abortion. And gay rights, from sexual freedom to marital rights, will be a prime candidate for the fundamentalist chopping block."

The Dobbs ruling will also have economic consequences, and according to Axios reporter Emily Peck, economists are \"racing to study\" the \"impact\" that Roe' s demise will have in the United States.\n\nPeck, in an article published by Axios on July 5, reports that economists are \"examining the fallout on women's lives across a range of factors, from health to finances.\"\n\n\"There's a raft of research on the impact of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but the work didn't get seriously underway until the late 1980s,\" Peck explains. \"Now, because of advances in technology and research methods - and because the profession has evolved to study 'women's issues' - researchers will move more quickly. Their studies can help policymakers and healthcare providers adjust to the post- Roe landscape.\"\n\nPeck notes that \"about half the states in the country are expected to ban or heavily restrict abortion,\" while \"the rest won't.\" And economists, according to Peck, will be examining the economic impact in the states that outlaw abortion or greatly restrict abortion compared to the ones that don't.\n\nCaitlin Knowles Myers, an economist at Middlebury College in Vermont, is \"known for her work on abortion,\" according to Peck - and Myers told Axios that her e-mail has been \"absolutely flooded\" with requests from social scientists looking for data.\n\n\"What we're looking at is a natural experiment of a magnitude we haven't seen since the Roe era,\" Myers told Axios.\n\nSimilarly, Kathryn Anne Edwards, an economist for the Rand Corporation, told Axios, \"Everyone under the rainbow is going to be publishing on this.\"\n\nResearchers, according to Peck, will be \"crafting studies\" on \"the health fallout for women\" and what will \"happen\" with \"abortion rates.\"\n\n\"Economists will, of course, also look at economics,\" Peck notes. \"Some household financial impact will happen quickly. For example, pregnancy can force women out of work, and have an immediate effect on families. The (New York Times) profiles a bookkeeper in Texas who was earning $35/hour, but couldn't access an abortion in Texas. Pregnancy complications forced her out of work. She now relies on a charity program for help.\"\n\nPeck adds, \"Other economic outcomes on labor force participation, earnings and career advancements will take longer to unspool, said David Slusky, an economics professor at the University of Kansas, who studied the effects of COVID clinic shutdowns on women and is now using the same methodology to look at Dobbs .\""

      "text": "Biological daughter of 'Jane Roe' torches Court for its overturn of the historical abortion rights precedent\n\nThe woman born of the conception that led to Roe v. Wade back in the 1970s is speaking out to share her reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn the 1973 landmark ruling.\n\nDuring a recent news interview, Shelley Lynn Thornton, the biological daughter of Norma McCorvey, who used the alias \"Jane Roe\" during the court proceedings, expressed her concerns about the latest ruling.\n\n\"Too many times has a woman's choice, voice and individual freedom been decided for her by others. Being that I am bound to the center of Roe v. Wade, I have a unique perspective on this matter specifically,\" Thornton said via a spokesperson.\n\nShe added, \"I believe that the decision to have an abortion is a private, medical choice that should be between a woman, her family, and her doctor. We have lived in times of uncertainty and insecurity before, but to have such a fundamental right taken away and this ruling be overturned concerns me of what lies ahead.\"\n\nUntil last year, Thornton's identity was unknown. But last year, she opted to speak publicly. McCorvey never had a chance to get the abortion she was fighting for due to the amount of time litigation took. After giving birth, she opted to give her baby up for adoption.\n\nIn 2021, Thornton was also featured in a piece published by The Atlantic titled, \" The Family Roe: An American Story .\" She shared details about her life and how she learned that she was the child at the center of the case. Thornton shared her double-sided reaction to learning that her biological mother initially planned to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nPer Business Insider, Thornton revealed the revelation \"had affected her mental health, making her anxious and depressed. But she also said that she didn't want to be used as an anti-abortion symbol.\" While the revelation personally impacted her, she also questioned why it is a \"government concern.\"\n\n\"I guess I don't understand why it's a government concern,\" Thornton told The Atlantic.\n\nThornton echoed remarks similar to McCorvey's oldest daughter, Melissa Mills who recently appeared on CNN's \"New Day\" to share her reaction to the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"I was in disbelief. I was devastated,\" Mills said during the appearance. \"I knew it was coming, but it was just too real that it really happened.\""

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nJudges, state lawmakers and voters are deciding the future of abortion in the U.S. two years after the Supreme Court jolted the legal status quo with a ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe June 24, 2022, ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization sparked legislative action, protest and numerous lawsuits - placing the issue at the center of politics across the country.\n\nAbortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, in 14 Republican-controlled states. In three other states, it's barred after about the first six weeks, which is before many know they are pregnant. Most Democratic-led states have taken actions to protect abortion rights, and become sanctuaries for out-of-state patients seeking care.\n\nThat's changed the landscape of abortion access, making it more of a logistical and financial ordeal for many in conservative states. But it has not reduced the overall number of procedures done each month across the U.S.\n\nHere's what to know about the state of abortion rights in the U.S. now.\n\nBans in Republican-led states have prompted many people seeking abortions to travel to get care.\n\nThat translates into higher costs for gas or plane tickets, hotels and meals; more logistics to figure out, including child care; and more days off work.\n\nA new study by the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for abortion access, found that out of just over a million abortions provided in clinics, hospitals and doctors' offices, more than 161,000 - or 16% - were for people who crossed state lines to get them.\n\nMore than two-thirds of abortions done in Kansas and New Mexico were for out-of-staters, particularly Texans.\n\nSince Florida's six-week abortion ban kicked in in May, many people had to travel farther than before, since throughout the Southeast, most states have bans.\n\nLow-income patients and those lacking legal permission to be in the country are more likely to be unable to travel. There can be lasting costs for those who do.\n\nIn Alabama, the Yellowhammer Fund, which previously helped residents pay for the procedure has paused doing so since facing threats of litigation from the state .\n\nJenice Fountain, Yellowhammer's executive director, said she met a woman recently who traveled from Alabama to neighboring Georgia for an abortion but found she couldn't get one there because she was slightly too far into her pregnancy. So she then went to Virginia. The journey wiped out her rent money and she needed help to remain housed.\n\n\"We're having people use every dime that they have to get out of state, or use every dime they have to have another child,\" Fountain said.\n\nFILE - People march through downtown Amarillo to protest a lawsuit to ban the abortion drug mifepristone, Feb. 11, 2023, in Amarillo, Texas. (AP Photo/Justin Rex, File)\n\nNearly two-thirds of known abortions last year were provided with pills rather than procedures .\n\nOne report found that pills are prescribed via telehealth and mailed to about 6,000 people a month who live in states with abortion bans. They're sent by medical providers in states with laws intended to protect them from prosecution for those prescriptions. The laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington specifically protect medical providers who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans.\n\nThe growing prominence of pills, which were used in about half of all abortions just before the Dobbs ruling, is a frontier in the latest chapter of the legal fight.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court this month unanimously rejected an effort by abortion opponents who were seeking to overturn or roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs usually used together for medication abortions. The issue is likely to return .\n\nIn this presidential election year, abortion is a key issue.\n\nProtecting access has emerged as a key theme in the campaigns of Democrats, including President Joe Biden in his reelection bid . Former President Donald Trump , the presumptive Republican nominee, has said states should decide whether to restrict abortions. He also suggested states could limit contraception use but changed his tune on that.\n\n\"We recognize this could be the last Dobbs anniversary we celebrate,\" Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in an interview, noting that if Democrats win the presidency and regain control of both chambers of Congress, a right to abortion could be enshrined in the law.\n\nThe issue will also be put directly before voters in at least four states. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have ballot measures this year asking voters to approve state constitutional amendments that would protect or expand access to abortion. A New York measure would bar discrimination against someone who has an abortion. There are attempts to put questions about abortion access on the ballots this year in Arkansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and Nevada.\n\nThere's also a push for a ballot measure in Arizona, where the state Supreme Court this year ruled that an 1864 abortion ban could be enforced. With the help of some Republicans - Democrats in the Legislature were able to repeal that law .\n\nGenerally, abortion rights expand when voters are deciding. In the seven statewide abortion policy-related votes since 2022, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates in every case.\n\nFILE - Paul Meacham holds high a sign that reads \"Ohio is pro-life\" as the crowd prays during the Ohio March for Life rally at the Ohio State House in Columbus, Ohio, Friday, Oct. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nThe Dobbs ruling and its aftermath gave rise to a bevy of legal questions and lawsuits challenging nearly every ban and restriction.\n\nMany of those questions deal with how exceptions - which come into play far more often when abortion is barred earlier in pregnancy - should apply. The issue is often raised by those who wanted to be pregnant but who experienced life-threatening complications.\n\nA group of women who had serious pregnancy complications but were denied abortions in Texas sued, claiming the state's ban is vague about which exceptions are allowed. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court disagreed in a May ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court also heard arguments in April on the federal government's lawsuit against Idaho, which says its ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy can extend to women in medical emergencies. The Biden administration says that violates federal law. A ruling on that case could be issued at any time.\n\nMeanwhile, bans have been put on hold by judges in Iowa, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court on Friday stripped away women's constitutional protections for abortion , a fundamental and deeply personal change for Americans' lives after nearly a half-century under Roe v. Wade. The court's overturning of the landmark court ruling is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.\n\nThe ruling, unthinkable just a few years ago, was the culmination of decades of efforts by abortion opponents, made possible by an emboldened right side of the court fortified by three appointees of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth sides predicted the fight over abortion would continue, in state capitals, in Washington and at the ballot box. Justice Clarence Thomas, part of Friday's majority, urged colleagues to overturn other high court rulings protecting same-sex marriage, gay sex and the use of contraceptives.\n\nPregnant women considering abortions already had been dealing with a near-complete ban in Oklahoma and a prohibition after roughly six weeks in Texas. Clinics in at least eight other states - Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, South Dakota, Wisconsin and West Virginia - stopped performing abortions after Friday's decision.\n\nIn Ohio, a ban on most abortions at the first detectable fetal heartbeat became the law when a federal judge dissolved an injunction that had kept the measure on hold for nearly three years. And Utah's law was triggered by the ruling, going into effect with narrow exceptions.\n\nAbortion foes cheered the ruling , but abortion-rights supporters, including President Joe Biden, expressed dismay and pledged to fight to restore the rights.\n\nProtests built into the evening in a number of cities, including thousands demonstrating against the decision outside the barricaded Supreme Court. Thousands more chanted \"We will rise up!\" in New York's Washington Square.\n\nAt the White House, Biden said, \"It's a sad day for the court and for the country.\" He urged voters to make it a defining issue in the November elections, declaring, \"This decision must not be the final word.\"\n\nOutside the White House, Ansley Cole, a college student from Atlanta, said she was \"scared because what are they going to come after next? ... The next election cycle is going to be brutal, like it's terrifying. And if they're going to do this, again, what's next?\"\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, agreed about the political stakes.\n\n\"We are ready to go on offense for life in every single one of those legislative bodies, in each statehouse and the White House,\" Dannenfelser said in a statement.\n\nTrump praised the ruling, telling Fox News that it \"will work out for everybody.\"\n\nThe decision is expected to disproportionately affect minority women who already face limited access to health care, according to statistics analyzed by The Associated Press.\n\nIt also puts the court at odds with a majority of Americans who favored preserving Roe, according to opinion polls.\n\nSurveys conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and others have shown a majority in favor of abortion being legal in all or most circumstances. But many also support restrictions especially later in pregnancy. Surveys consistently show that about 1 in 10 Americans want abortion to be illegal in all cases.\n\nThe ruling came more than a month after the stunning leak of a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito indicating the court was prepared to take this momentous step.\n\nAlito, in the final opinion issued Friday , wrote that Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to abortion, were wrong had and to be be overturned.\n\n\"We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives,\" Alito wrote, in an opinion that was very similar to the leaked draft.\n\nJoining Alito were Thomas and Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett. The last three justices are Trump appointees. Thomas first voted to overrule Roe 30 years ago.\n\nFour justices would have left Roe and Casey in place.\n\nThe vote was 6-3 to uphold Mississippi's law banning most abortions after 15 weeks, but Chief Justice John Roberts didn't join his conservative colleagues in overturning Roe. He wrote that there was no need to overturn the broad precedents to rule in Mississippi's favor.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - the diminished liberal wing of the court - were in dissent.\n\n\"With sorrow - for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection - we dissent,\" they wrote, warning that abortion opponents now could pursue a nationwide ban \"from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department will protect providers and those seeking abortions in states where it is legal and \"work with other arms of the federal government that seek to use their lawful authorities to protect and preserve access to reproductive care.\"\n\nIn particular, Garland said the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Mifepristone for medication abortions.\n\nMore than 90% of abortions take place in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, and more than half are now done with pills, not surgery, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\nMississippi's only abortion clinic, which was at the center of Friday's case, continued to see patients Friday. Outside, men used a bullhorn to tell people inside that they would burn in hell. Clinic escorts wearing colorful vests used large speakers to blast Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" at the protesters.\n\nMississippi, Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri are among 13 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, that already have laws on the books to ban abortion in the event Roe was overturned. Another half-dozen states have near-total bans or prohibitions after 6 weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.\n\nIn roughly a half-dozen other states, including West Virginia and Wisconsin, the fight will be over dormant abortion bans that were enacted before Roe was decided in 1973 or new proposals to sharply limit when abortions can be performed, according to Guttmacher.\n\nOutside the barricaded Supreme Court, a crowd of mostly young women grew into the hundreds within hours of the decision. Some shouted, \"The Supreme Court is illegitimate,\" while waves of others, wearing red shirts with \"The Pro-Life Generation Votes,\" celebrated, danced and thrust their arms into the air.\n\nThe Biden administration and other defenders of abortion rights have warned that a decision overturning Roe also would threaten other high court decisions in favor of gay rights and even potentially contraception.\n\nThe liberal justices made the same point in their joint dissent: The majority \"eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women's freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court's legitimacy.\"\n\nAnd Thomas, the member of the court most open to jettisoning prior decisions, wrote a separate opinion in which he explicitly called on his colleagues to put the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage, gay sex and contraception cases on the table.\n\nBut Alito contended that his analysis addresses abortion only. \"Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,\" he wrote.\n\nWhatever the intentions of the person who leaked Alito's draft opinion, the conservatives held firm in overturning Roe and Casey.\n\nIn his opinion, Alito dismissed the arguments in favor of retaining the two decisions, including that multiple generations of American women have partly relied on the right to abortion to gain economic and political power.\n\nChanging the makeup of the court has been central to the anti-abortion side's strategy, as the dissenters archly noted. \"The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed,\" the liberal justices wrote.\n\nMississippi and its allies made increasingly aggressive arguments as the case developed, and two high-court defenders of abortion rights retired or died. The state initially argued that its law could be upheld without overruling the court's abortion precedents.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy retired shortly after the Mississippi law took effect in 2018 and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020. Both had been members of a five-justice majority that was mainly protective of abortion rights.\n\nIn their Senate hearings, Trump's three high-court picks carefully skirted questions about how they would vote in any cases, including about abortion.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jessica Gresko, Fatima Hussein, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist Nathan Ellgren in Washington, Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston, Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, Leah Willingham in Charleston, West Virginia, Michael Hill in New York and Kantele Franko in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.\n\nFor AP's full coverage of the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, go to https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Whatever the outcome, the Politico report represents an extremely rare breach of the court's secretive deliberation process, and on a case of surpassing importance. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nA leaked draft of a U.S. Supreme Court decision suggests the country's highest court could be poised to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, allowing individual states to more heavily regulate or even ban the procedure.\n\nWHAT DOES 'ROE V. WADE' REFER TO?\n\nRoe v. Wade is the name of the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion in the United States. The majority opinion found an absolute right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nWHO WERE ROE AND WADE?\n\nJane Roe was a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey, who was 22, unmarried, unemployed and pregnant for the third time in 1969 when she sought to have an abortion in Texas. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in her favor, McCorvey had given birth to a girl whom she placed for adoption.\n\nHenry Wade was the district attorney of Dallas County, Texas. It was his job to enforce a state law prohibiting abortion except to save a woman's life, so he was the person McCorvey sued when she sought the abortion.\n\nAfter her death, biographer Joshua Prager said McCorvey made her living giving speeches and writing books on both sides of the abortion debate and was coached by both sides. She had conflicted feelings about each, he said, but was consistent on one point: supporting abortion through the first trimester.\n\nWHAT DID THE COURT DECIDE IN 1973?\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that Texas law was unconstitutionally vague and violated her constitutionally protected right to personal privacy. The question before the U.S. Supreme Court was: Does the Constitution recognize a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?\n\nJustice Harry Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 7-2 majority, finding that it did indeed - although that protection had to be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and \"the potentiality of human life.\" The conservative-leaning court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of her pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.\n\nWHAT WAS THE PRE-ROE LANDSCAPE IN THE U.S.?\n\nAt the time of Roe, abortion was broadly legal in just four states and allowed under limited circumstances in 16 others. Constitutional rights trump state laws, so the court's decision nullified the bans in the remaining 30 states. But it did allow states to impose certain regulations during the second trimester to protect the woman's health and take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester.\n\nHOW HAVE LATER DECISIONS ALTERED ABORTION RIGHTS IN AMERICA?\n\nBlackmun was still on the court in 1992, when it heard Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a challenge to Pennsylvania abortion laws that included a 24-hour waiting period. The conservative-leaning court unexpectedly upheld the right to abortion -while also making it easier for states to impose regulations.\n\nThree conservative justices - Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter - co-authored the court's main opinion in the 5-4 decision, writing: \"The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe vs. Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.′′\n\nNeither side on the abortion issue was pleased with the ruling. Since then, conservative states have been chipping away at abortion rights with laws that have engendered many more court challenges, including a recent Texas law that bans most abortions after about six weeks .\n\nWHAT IS THIS NEW CASE THAT'S POISED TO TOPPLE ROE?\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. It challenges Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks .\n\nUpholding that ban would undermine both Roe and Casey, which allow states to regulate - but not ban - abortion up until the point of fetal viability, at roughly 24 weeks. The decision, per the draft, would likely result in a patchwork of abortion laws , with some states protecting abortion and others prohibiting it outright.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Wade ruling on Jan. 22, 1973, the time around the anniversary has always been marked by rallies, protests and political pledges.\n\nThis time, after the 2022 ruling that overturned the nationwide right to abortion that Roe provided, there's a flurry of activity as state policy gets decided by courts, lawmakers and voters.\n\nIt's also giving Democrats, including President Joe Biden's reelection campaign , a chance to rally voters around abortion access.\n\nAbortion opponents also rallied last week in Washington with a context that's different from past editions of the annual March for Life. There's no longer a nationwide right to abortion and 14 states have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. But the political fallout has boosted their opponents more than them.\n\nThere were still some traditional anti-abortion rallies, including one in St. Paul, Minnesota, where an estimated 2,000 people attended, with many placing life-size models of fetuses on the steps of the state Capitol in protest of policies that protect abortion access.\n\nHere's what to know about several developments.\n\nAt least a hundred people gathered on the steps of the Colorado Capitol on Monday to launch a signature campaign for a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. A cardboard sign read, \"Someone you love has had an abortion,\" as state lawmakers and the Colorado attorney general bunched around a microphone and the crowd cheered.\n\nColorado's legislature passed abortion protections last year, but \"if we don't enshrine it in the constitution, we will be at the whim of lawmakers,\" said Nicole Hensel, executive director of New Era Colorado, one of the coalition of groups behind the Coloradans for Protecting Reproductive Freedom campaign.\n\nColorado has become an island of abortion protections as surrounding states installed restrictions after Roe was overturned. The Cobalt Abortion Fund based in Colorado spent six times the amount helping people get abortions in 2023 as they did in 2021.\n\nAdvocates in Maryland also used Monday's Roe v. Wade anniversary to begin their campaign to support the ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution that's already on the ballot there for November.\n\nThe only other state where a statewide vote on abortion rights in 2024 is sure to happen is New York , where the proposed amendment includes protecting reproductive freedom.\n\nBut similar votes are under consideration in more than a dozen states .\n\nSince 2022, abortion rights supporters have prevailed on all seven statewide ballot measures .\n\nLawmakers in two states scheduled hearings for Monday as first steps to ask voters to change abortion policy. Both face uphill battles.\n\nIn Maine, Democrats are pushing for a measure that would protect reproductive autonomy in the state constitution.\n\nDemocrats control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor's office and, under state law, abortion is allowed at any point throughout pregnancy, if it's deemed necessary by a doctor.\n\nBut advancing a measure to voters would require the approval of two-thirds of both legislative chambers. To reach that, several Republicans would have to vote in favor of asking the public to vote.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a GOP proposal would ban abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nRepublicans control the legislature there, but Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, would likely veto the measure if it passed.\n\nCurrently, abortion is available in Wisconsin until fetal viability, but there's litigation over whether an 1849 law that conservatives interpreted as banning abortion should apply.\n\nA coalition of abortion rights supporters in Missouri decided last week which of 11 amendment proposals to support.\n\nThey went with one that would allow lawmakers to restrict abortion access only after viability - generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks gestation age - when a fetus might survive outside the uterus.\n\nThe decision from groups including the state ACLU chapter and Planned Parenthood chapters is one solution to a debate advocates have been having on whether to support measures that allow some abortion restrictions.\n\nThe Missouri measure would allow abortion later in pregnancy to protect the life and physical and mental health of the woman.\n\nSome moderate Republicans are pushing a competing amendment , which would allow abortion up to 12 weeks in most cases, and between then and viability only in pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or in medical emergencies.\n\nUnder Missouri law, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy, with an exception to protect the life of the woman - but not in cases of rape or incest.\n\nIn a decision made in October but not revealed publicly until last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that an Oklahoma hospital did not violate federal law when doctors told a woman with a nonviable pregnancy to wait in a parking lot until her condition declined enough for her to qualify for an abortion under the state's strict ban.\n\nThe ruling was the latest in what's emerged as a major legal question as most Republican-controlled states have imposed abortion bans: When do exceptions apply?\n\nIn other situations, the same federal agency has maintained that hospitals would violate federal law by turning away women seeking an abortion amid medical emergencies.\n\nPending lawsuits from women who assert they were wrongly denied an abortion address the issue.\n\nEven as the Biden administration ruled in favor of the hospital in the Oklahoma case, it's planning to help people file complaints under the law that's intended to ensure emergency health care access.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press/Report for America reporters Trisha Ahmed in Minneapolis and Jesse Bedayn in Denver contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Adam Bettcher, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Kamala Harris is using the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade to argue that Donald Trump is \"guilty\" of rolling back women's freedoms and setting off a nationwide health care crisis.\n\nHarris said Monday that Trump \"intended\" for his three Supreme Court picks to overturn Roe. \"It was premeditated,\" she said. \"Trump has not denied, much less shown remorse, for his actions.\"\n\nThe vice president, in a nod to her background as a California prosecutor, added, \"In the case of the stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America, Donald Trump is guilty.\"\n\nWhile President Joe Biden is sequestered at Camp David preparing for this week's presidential debate with presumptive Republican nominee Trump, the vice president is headlining events on the anniversary of the high court decision, which Democrats hope will be a critical galvanizer for them in the election. She headed to Arizona for a second reproductive rights event later Monday.\n\nThe campaign's push over the past week has featured first lady Jill Biden and a number of women who were motivated to join the 2024 effort after they suffered - or nearly died - in the face of restrictive abortion laws that were, in some cases, applied even though they never intended to end their pregnancies.\n\nThe overturning of federal protections has meant the issue is now mostly in the hands of state legislatures, where the laws wildly vary. At least 25 million women now live in states with abortion restrictions and are facing increasingly dire consequences. And it's changing how and where doctors are choosing to practice medicine.\n\nTrump has repeatedly taken credit for the overturning of a federally guaranteed right to abortion. He nominated three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade but has since resisted supporting a national abortion ban .\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans said abortion should be legal in at least some cases, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted last summer. The survey also found that 6 in 10 U.S. adults thought Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.\n\nSupport for legal abortion was particularly high in situations where the pregnant individual's own health was seriously endangered by the pregnancy. In the poll, more than 8 in 10 Americans said an abortion under those circumstances should be permitted in their state. Support for legal abortion early in pregnancy was also high, with about three-quarters saying it should be allowed in their state at that point.\n\nOther Democratic candidates running for office are also focusing their campaigns around reproductive rights and believe it will motivate voters in key swing states.\n\nJessica Mackler, president of Emily's List, a group that supports Democratic women, referred Monday to the 2023 election win by Janet Protasiewicz, a liberal candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court who made abortion rights a focus of her campaign, as an example of how the issue can be used to win.\n\n\"I know when we do this work we can win,\" Mackler said at an event with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection.\n\n\"This isn't a branding problem for Republicans. It's an agenda problem. We can't let them get away with it,\" she said.\n\nDr. Kristin Lyerly, an obstetrician and gynecologist running for an open congressional seat in Wisconsin, said Monday that it's an issue of freedom.\n\n\"People are concerned about the cost of gas and groceries,\" Lyerly said on a conference call with reporters. \"They do talk about the border, but the fundamental thing that they are concerned about is the ability to make their own personal health care decisions. This is an issue of freedom. It's not a political issue for them. It's existential.\"\n\nLyerly performed abortions across Wisconsin but temporarily moved her practice to Minnesota after the Supreme Court's ruling. She was among those who brought a successful lawsuit challenging the state's abortion ban.\n\nThe White House is also detailing its policy efforts to protect access to abortion, contraception access and the right to travel for medical care, as it awaits another high-court decision expected sometime this month that will affect how women receive emergency medical care .\n\n\"The overturning of Roe has been devastating for women across the country,\" said Jennifer Klein, a White House adviser on reproductive health.\n\nKlein said the administration is already working to implement three executive orders by Biden aimed at protecting access where able, guarding contraceptive care and privacy rights, and expanding health care. That push will continue if the president is reelected.\n\nThe high court earlier this month preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year, in the court's first abortion decision since the case that overturned Roe.\n\nBut there's one more case, related to a federal law, called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act , or EMTALA, The law requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room and applies to nearly all emergency rooms - any that accept Medicare funding.\n\nThe Justice Department has sued Idaho over its abortion law, which allows a woman to get an abortion only when her life - not her health - is at risk. The state law has raised questions about when a doctor is able to provide the stabilizing treatment that federal law requires.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisc. and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

A new report shows the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen since the Supreme Court's ruling that opened the door for state bans. The #WeCount report says a major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states have laws to protect prescribers who use telemedicine to see patients in places with abortion bans. (AP Digital Embed)\n\nThe number of women getting abortions in the U.S. actually went up in the first three months of 2024 compared with before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a report released Wednesday found, reflecting the lengths that Democratic-controlled states went to expand access.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nAP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports on new research that finds abortion numbers have increased in the United States.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy - and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nThe report estimates that if not for the post-Dobbs bans, there would have been about 9,900 more abortions per month - and 208,000 total since - in those states. The numbers were up by more than 2,600 per month in Illinois, about 1,300 in Virginia, 1,200 in Kansas and more than 500 in New Mexico.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth - accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year, when it counted an average of just under 99,000 abortions per month, compared with 84,000 in the two months before Dobbs. January was the first time since the survey began that it has counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nThe tracking effort collects monthly data from providers across the country, creating a snapshot of abortion trends. In some states, a portion of the data is estimated. The effort makes data public with less than a six-month lag, giving a picture of trends far faster than annual reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where the most recent report covers abortion in 2021.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April , when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It needs at least 60% approval to be added to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current ban on most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy - and access - since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to vote for the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is on the ballot, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nAnti-abortion groups hoped and strategized for decades for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that was delivered in June, ending a court-protected right to abortion after nearly 50 years.\n\nThe fallout was immediate and far-reaching - and it's not over yet.\n\nThe midyear ruling overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established the right to abortion, shaped the national political agenda for the rest of the year and put abortion access in flux. The shifts are expected to keep coming as lawmakers, voters and judges weigh in.\n\nAfter the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling that left abortion up to the states , bans went into effect in some states. Elsewhere, officials enacted new protections for abortion.\n\nWith the bans, a generation of court battles has emerged over whether they square with state constitutions.\n\nIn a half-dozen statewide ballot measures this year, voters sided with abortion rights.\n\nHere's a look at what has changed, what hasn't and what remains unclear six months after the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson decision.\n\nTHE BANS\n\nAbortion is currently considered illegal at all stages of pregnancy, with various exceptions, in 13 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nIn Georgia, it's banned once cardiac activity can be detected - around six weeks, which is before women often realize they're pregnant.\n\nSome of the bans are in \"trigger laws\" that were passed years ago in anticipation of a ruling like Dobbs. Some are in laws that predate Roe v. Wade.\n\nLawmakers in Indiana and West Virginia adopted new bans after this year's ruling. Enforcement of Indiana's is on hold because of a legal challenge.\n\nIn both states, there was little question about whether bans would be adopted, but there were emotional debates over whether to include exceptions in the cases of rape and incest. Both states ultimately included those exceptions - and for abortions in the case of medical emergencies.\n\nBans in Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming are also not in effect, at least for now, as courts decide whether they can be enforced in the future.\n\nEven in places where lawmakers favor bans, debates remain about which exceptions should be included. So far, states have been allowing later abortions to protect the woman's physical health but not always her mental health .\n\nTHE PROTECTIONS\n\nBefore and soon after the Supreme Court ruling, Democratic-controlled state and local governments took steps to protect abortion access.\n\nThey have enacted laws and signed executive orders to protect those who provide abortions for out-of-state patients from extradition, bar state employees from helping abortion-related investigations from other states, pay for more security at abortion clinics and provide funding for abortion.\n\nIn November, voters in California, Michigan and Vermont approved ballot measures to declare that the right to abortion is protected by the state constitutions. Voters in Kansas - who went to the polls in August - and Kentucky rejected measures that would have done the opposite and found that the state constitutions did not ensure abortion rights. Montana voters rejected a ballot measure that would have forced medical workers to intercede in the rare case of a baby born after an attempted abortion.\n\nIn December, New Jersey officials announced a grant to train more medical professionals to provide abortions.\n\nTHE IMPACT\n\nIt will take time to assess the full impact of the Dobbs ruling through data, including the number of abortions and births.\n\nThe number of abortions has dropped nearly to zero in states with bans and risen in neighboring states, according to a survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning. Overall, the study found, the number of abortions fell.\n\nBut the survey does not include self-managed abortions received outside of clinics, medical offices, hospitals and virtual providers.\n\nDoctors and researchers say that the number of requests for medication abortion pills increased dramatically after a draft version of the Dobbs ruling was leaked in May.\n\nIt won't be clear for at least several months, though, whether the number of births has changed since the ruling.\n\nGetting abortions has become increasingly difficult for women who live in states with bans, in some cases resulting in increased medical complications and in others forcing residents to travel for hours or even days to reach a facility that can provide abortions legally.\n\nThe ruling also sparked other changes to life in the U.S.: For some medical students, it meant that residencies in liberal states became a priority. Teens and parents considered birth control anew. Democrats intent on protecting abortion rights fared better than expected in elections across the U.S. in November, even retaining control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nAnd concerns that Supreme Court rulings could undo other court-mandated protections regarding marriage, sex and contraception and led to passage of a new federal law further protecting same-sex and interracial marriages .\n\nTHE ENFORCEMENT\n\nThere have been no well-publicized criminal charges alleging violations of abortion bans since they were put into place - and maybe none at all.\n\n\"It could be a situation where the fear of being prosecuted is going to be the bigger impact than actual prosecutions,\" said Mon Sahaf, a deputy director of Vera Institute of Justice.\n\nClinics in states with bans have closed or stopped providing abortions. Some have been extra cautious , halting abortions when the legality in the state in question was uncertain .\n\nSahaf says enforcement of abortion laws is tricky because it requires using medical records and could be seen as unfair in many communities.\n\nProsecutors have expressed reluctance about taking on the cases. Ninety of them across the country pledged as Dobbs was announced that they would not enforce abortion bans. The group includes those in some of the most populous jurisdictions in states with bans or deep restrictions, including the district attorneys who oversee prosecutions in Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Milwaukee; and Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThat doesn't mean there are no legal repercussions for those who seek or provide abortion.\n\nThe attorney general in Indiana last month asked the state's medical licensing board to discipline a doctor who spoke publicly about providing an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim who traveled from Ohio after that state's abortion ban took effect.\n\nTHE ASSISTANCE\n\nAbortion funds have been around for decades, largely as scrappy volunteer-run groups with small budgets trying to help women pay for abortions.\n\nThe Dobbs ruling inspired more contributions to the groups, but also brought them more challenges and a bigger political and legal role, including suing over abortion bans in Texas.\n\nThe groups are now helping women travel to other states for abortions, which increases transportation, lodging, child care and other costs.\n\n\"Rage giving\" after the Supreme Court ruling helped make the groups less underfunded. Oriaku Njoku, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, said an influx of donations this year has allowed some funds to bring on their first paid staff members.\n\nDestini Spaeth, director of the North Dakota WIN Abortion Access Fund, said enough money rolled in at the fund in May, when a version of the Dobbs ruling was leaked, and June, when the final decision was released, to provide a year's worth of services.\n\nThe fund, like others, pays for abortion care and related services such as transportation, lodging, medical testing and birth control.\n\nAt another fund, Atlanta-based ARC Southeast, interim Executive Director Jalessah Jackson said that because of bans in the region, her organization is getting fewer callers after Dobbs. But the costs for travel, child care and other services has risen largely from people needing to go farther for abortion care.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nWith split partisan control in Washington, federal policy changes are unlikely in 2023. Even with Democrats in charge this year, President Joe Biden's administration's efforts to protect abortion hit roadblocks.\n\nStill, state lawmakers are looking to strengthen both abortion bans and protections .\n\nAmong bills already introduced for 2023 state legislative sessions are measures in Texas that would take tax incentives away from businesses that help employees obtain abortions and in Missouri and Montana to ban bringing pills used to induce abortion into the state.\n\nOn the other side, there are pushes in red states including South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas to amend the state constitutions to ensure a right to abortion and plans by Minnesota Democrats, who will control the legislature in January, to codify abortion protections in state law.\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published on December 20, 2022.

(AP) - On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby - their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nA cross hangs in the prayer room at the Paul Stefan Foundation maternity home in Orange, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024.

The couple started the home after losing the last of their six children. (AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThere's been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of them to meet a growing need. But maternity homes have had a traumatic history. (AP Video: Jessie Wardarski)\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nMeryem Bakache, left, a mother at Mary's Shelter maternity home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Jasmine Heriot, right, a former Mary's Shelter resident, hold their children on Friday, January 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh holds her newborn daughter at the Florence Crittenton Maternity Home in Washington D.C. on August 10, 1966.

(Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh via AP)\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nKathleen Wilson, founder of the maternity home organization Mary's Shelter, sits for a portrait at one of the homes in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voiceless birthmother ,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center - often called a crisis pregnancy center - which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter , a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement - and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nJasmine Heriot, right, a former Mary's Shelter resident, talks to the child of Meryem Bakache, a mother at Mary's Shelter maternity home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nAt Paul Stefan , churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDanielle Nicholson, a former maternity home resident of the Paul Stefan Foundation, sits for a portrait on Friday, January 5, 2024, in Orange, Virginia.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski)\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wade decision is unpopular with a majority of Americans - but did that matter?\n\nThe relationship between the public and the judiciary has been studied and debated by legal and political scholars. The short answer: it's complicated. There's evidence that the public has an indirect role in the judiciary, but that might be changing.\n\nIn the final opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the court \"cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction to our work.\"\n\nPolls following the leaked draft of the opinion show approval of the Supreme Court - which was already suffering - slumped even further , driven by those who supported keeping Roe.\n\nThe court and public opinion have clashed at times, but they've entered into a \"symbiotic relationship\" over the last 60 years, Barry Friedman suggests in his 2009 book \"The Will of the People.\" The court doesn't stray too far from popular opinion.\n\nHow that happens and whether it remains true are harder to know for certain. \"We don't have a viewfinder that shows us what the justices are doing,\" said Maya Sen, political scientist and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"It's a complicated chicken-and-egg situation where we can try to disentangle these forces, but it's very hard to do.\"\n\nIS PUBLIC OPINION ON ABORTION CLEAR?\n\nPublic opinion on abortion is nuanced, but polling shows broad support for Roe and for abortion rights. Seventy percent of U.S. adults said in a May AP-NORC poll that the Supreme Court should leave Roe as is, not overturn it.\n\nRoe is one of \"a handful of cases\" that people recognize, Sen said, and it's \"recognized as important Supreme Court precedent.\"\n\nOnly 8% in the May poll said abortion should be illegal in all cases, but many Americans support some restrictions. An AP-NORC poll last year showed majorities of adults say abortion in the second and third trimesters should be illegal in all or most cases, and opinions were closely divided over whether a pregnant woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion for any reason.\n\n\"I think many Americans believe that there should be some sort of kind of sliding scale where the right is protected and then as the pregnancy continues, then the interests of the potential life become more significant,\" Sen said, adding that Roe allowed for that nuanced thinking.\n\nDOES PUBLIC OPINION FACTOR DIRECTLY IN COURT DECISION-MAKING?\n\nResearchers have found - and some of the justices themselves have acknowledged - that court decisions and public opinion are often aligned, but some experts say it's probably not a direct link.\n\nThe most important thing in decision-making is justices' \"set of political and judicial philosophies that give them preferences over the outcomes of the cases,\" said Joseph Ura, political science professor at Texas A&M University. \"Everything else is kind of marginal around that.\"\n\nJustices themselves experience the same things that everyday Americans do, which makes it harder to assess causality.\n\n\"It's really hard to decipher: was it public opinion that's driving these decisions or is it just that the justices have preferences and they're exposed to the same thing that most of us are exposed to?\" said Elizabeth Lane, assistant professor of political science at Louisiana State University.\n\nDOES PUBLIC OPINION INDIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE COURT?\n\nScholars point to judicial appointments and court legitimacy as potential ways that the public has indirect influence on the court.\n\nFor one, voters elect a president, who nominates justices, and senators, who confirm them.\n\n\"Over the longer run, assuming there's kind of a reasonable rotation of the justices leaving office for whatever reason that aligns with the party's historical alternation in power, the court can preserve its alignment with public opinion,\" said Ura.\n\nThat's been undermined recently, experts say. By chance and by political maneuvering, a larger number of sitting justices - six of them - were appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nIn their dissent, the court's liberal justices wrote: \"The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed.\"\n\nJustices may also consider how the public will receive a ruling, though the new abortion ruling makes clear some on the court don't believe that's an important consideration.\n\nWhile the court can issue its ruling, it has to rely on other actors - the public, politicians and even lower courts - to accept and implement it, said Charles Franklin, professor of law and public policy and director of the Marquette Law School poll.\n\n\"I doubt that the justices wake up every morning and check the polls to see if people agree, but over the long haul, the court does need a level of public support as a mechanism for their rulings being enforced,\" Franklin said.\n\nThe threshold of support that the court needs might be changing. A reaction from the public or elected officials has \"less currency\" than it used to because of deepening political polarization, Ura said. A controversial or unpopular decision won't necessarily raise the ire of a bipartisan coalition.\n\nDOES IT MATTER IF THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN THE COURT IS LOW?\n\nThe court has historically enjoyed consistently positive views among the public. But polling showed confidence in and approval of the court began to dip last year, and it has worsened since the leaked draft. Does it matter if the public's faith in the court is low?\n\n\"The idea of the legitimacy of the court was a way it could sustain itself when it ruled counter to the majority opinion,\" Franklin said.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor recently emphasized the need for public faith in the court system. Justice Elena Kagan in 2018 spelled out why: \"You know we don't have an army. We don't have any money. The only way we can get people to do what we think they should do is because people respect us.\"\n\nMichael Salamone, political science professor at Washington State University, explained that \"specific support\" for the court - what's measured in polls - can easily fluctuate with reactions to court decisions. But \"diffuse support\" - faith in the institution's role in democracy - is historically resilient. It remains to be seen whether that diffuse support will suffer because of the decision to overturn Roe.\n\n\"Just based on the amount of rhetoric and the high-profile nature of so many of these decisions,\" he said, \"I'm wondering if we've perhaps reached our limit to that resilience.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jessica Gresko contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP's full coverage of the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, go to https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Roe Was Never Roe After All\n\nThe landmark decision never gave women the rights that people wanted to believe it did.\n\nTomorrow will mark 50 years since Roe v. Wade was decided, but the landmark ruling did not make it to its semicentennial, having been overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization last summer. Many people viewed this as the end of abortion rights in America. But that's not what it was. Both practically and theoretically, Roe was never the guarantor of those rights that people believed it to be.\n\nThe \" Roe \" that has occupied the center of the abortion debate for decades bears only a passing resemblance to anything the Supreme Court said in 1973. Roe has become much more than a legal text; it's a cultural symbol created not only by judges but by voters, politicians, and grassroots movements. And the history of America's fixation on Roe is a story not just about the power of the Supreme Court, but about how the Court alone does not-and should not-dictate what the Constitution says.\n\nMary Ziegler: If the Supreme Court can reverse Roe , it can reverse anything\n\nIn 1973, a Supreme Court stacked with Republican nominees handed down a 7-2 decision holding that the constitutional right to privacy was broad enough to protect an abortion choice made by a \" woman and her responsible physician .\" The text of Roe would be deeply foreign to almost anyone who reads it today. Justice Harry Blackmun's majority opinion spoke mostly about the prerogatives of doctors, not women, and breezily dismissed the idea that \"one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases .\" Ultimately, the Court's ruling did not so much embrace a sweeping notion of women's rights as it made regulating abortion harder, at least during the first trimester.\n\nFrom the beginning, many people celebrated Roe as a feminist triumph, especially for women of color, who generally suffered most when abortion was a crime . But life under Roe was in some ways disappointing for those who believed in abortion rights-or, in many cases, for those who sought an abortion. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment , which banned Medicaid reimbursement for abortion, and in 1980, the Supreme Court upheld it . Already, less than a decade after the Court's decision, the right to choose abortion was functionally out of reach for some of the nation's poorest women .\n\nThe gap between the fantasy and the reality of Roe grew wider after 1992, when the Supreme Court functionally overruled key parts of its 1973 decision and made a new precedent, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , the law of the land. Under Casey , states could regulate abortion as long as a law did not have the purpose or effect of creating a substantial obstacle for those seeking abortion-a standard that seemed relatively easy to satisfy (the Court struck down only one of the many restrictions before it in Casey ). After Casey , states passed an ever-growing number of restrictions, some of which the Court upheld. And yet even after the Court had wiped part of Roe away, Americans kept believing that Roe ruled everything, and they kept arguing over it-promising to undo its legacy or codify it .\n\nGrassroots movements developed new ideas about what Roe ought to stand for. The leader of one reproductive-justice group formed by women of color argued that Roe had \"never fully protected Black women- or poor women .\" Anti-abortion activists made Roe a symbol of \" judicial activism \" and jump-started conversations about the legitimacy of the federal courts. Roe may have been on the books, but it never settled debates about abortion-or even its own meaning-in any significant way.\n\nJerusalem Demsas: The fate of states' rights after Roe\n\nThe Dobbs decision echoed common anti-abortion-rights talking points about Roe being an undemocratic decision, and even repeated the argument that Roe resembled Plessy v. Ferguson , the notorious case that upheld racial segregation. In the Court's opinion, Justice Samuel Alito also seemed interested in ending constitutional conversations about abortion once and for all, rejecting not only the arguments raised in Roe and Casey but also a rationale for abortion rights based on sex equality that was neither briefed by the petitioner or respondent nor a part of either Roe or Casey .\n\nSince Dobbs came down, constitutional conflicts about abortion have only multiplied. Abortion-rights supporters have pursued what reporters call \" mini Roe s \" in state supreme courts, asking for the recognition of state constitutional rights. Six ballot initiatives have put the question directly to voters , and many more will likely follow . State lawmakers will have their say on what reproductive rights ought to mean-and whether it's constitutional to apply one state's laws to what happens in another, or to criminalize information about abortion. Maybe (though it's unlikely) Congress will pass a federal bill recognizing either an abortion right or fetal protections. All of these efforts make explicit something that had been clear to anyone looking closely enough while Roe was good law: Americans' rights don't come just from the Supreme Court. Even when the Court intervenes, it often-as in Dobbs -responds to political pressures and decades of fighting between grassroots groups and political parties. And sometimes our rights have nothing to do with the federal courts-they are also the result of state or federal legislation, state constitutional rulings, and ballot-initiative decisions passed by ordinary voters.\n\nRoe 's legacy is complex, and its aftereffects-on partisan politics, on fights about the separation of powers, and on battles about gender-will be felt for years to come. Those who support abortion rights may experience this anniversary as a loss. But they should look to history for the lesson Samuel Alito, the author of Dobbs , will soon learn-the lesson that Harry Blackmun had to learn years ago: The Court does not get the final word, even on the meaning of its own most important decisions.\n\n*Lead image: Illustration by Joanne Imperio.

      "text": "Roe Rage\n\nWho knew losing our rights would feel this bad?\n\nThey overturned Roe v. Wade on a sunny and hot Friday in June. I was taking my daughter for a haircut when the Supreme Court released its ruling declaring that our bodies were no longer ours. Roe had been the crowning achievement of my mother's generation of activism , and it was gone-a right we'd had for 49 years erased in pages of text we saw a draft of last month. And maybe it fit that as I was losing my mother, watching her disappear into dementia, we Americans were losing our rights.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision came down, my mother called me. \"I want to tweet something, but I don't remember how to.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. I sort of wanted to cry, but I was also sort of happy for her, that she didn't have to deal with the exquisite pain that is reality.\n\n\"I want to tweet: Women's rights are human rights .\"\n\n\"Oh, when I come over, I'll show you,\" I said, knowing she'd forget about it by the time I got there. I was angry: at my mom for her drinking, at myself for being angry at my mom, at Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Amy Coney Barrett. I was angry at Ruth Bader Ginsburg for not living longer. I was angry at Democrats for not doing more. I was angry at people for being mean to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Elizabeth Warren, because they were doing more than anyone else. I fought on Twitter with a white guy who wrote for a Never Trump news outlet. I wrote him angry direct messages and then blocked him. The next day I apologized, but I was still too angry to mean it.\n\nI turned on cable news and was told not to worry about my other rights. Birth control was safe, the same people who once told me I was being hysterical about Roe assured me. I wanted to scream. The whole weekend, TV news continued to suggest that I was overreacting, repeating that blue states would always have reproductive freedom. I read think pieces wishcasting a future where Republicans would embrace love and take care of the thousands of teen mothers the Supreme Court had created overnight. The idea that Roe was about anything other than power was so profoundly delusional that I felt like throwing my cellphone in Central Park's Turtle Pond. My inbox was filled with enraged friends. Girls were weeping and holding signs in Washington Square Park. A rock star listed Supreme Court justices at a concert and told them to fuck themselves . This was a seismic loss for women, but much of the media coverage-TV news in particular-was treating it like every other news cycle.\n\nEven more than feeling angry, I felt this loss, this profound loss. It wasn't until I read a tweet from the feminist writer Moira Donegan that I realized where it was coming from. \"Every woman has been deemed lesser. Every woman has had her citizenship degraded,\" she wrote. I was furious because I felt diminished. I was enraged because I knew that all of us had been deemed lesser.\n\nWhen I visited my mom, I didn't even want to bring it up. It would be too depressing. And what would it accomplish? She would just forget it again anyway. Why did I need to remind her about the thing that was wearing at me?\n\nI sat down with my mother and stepfather in her dining room. \"Oh, 1973. You're wearing a hat that says 1973,\" my mom said.\n\n\"Yes, I've been wearing it all weekend since the Dobbs decision came down.\"\n\n\"I graduated from college in 1973.\"\n\n\"No, Mom, you graduated from college in 1963. You wrote Fear of Flying in 1973.\"\n\n\"That's right. Ten years later.\"\n\nI knew Dobbs was coming in May. I'd read practically the whole thing in Politico , and yet I was completely unprepared for how it would feel. Here I am, a middle-aged, affluent white woman in a blue city in a blue state who will likely never need an abortion. I'm 43, probably too old to get pregnant, affluent enough to get on a plane if I did, and yet I can't stop feeling like something has been stripped from me. This ruling will likely have no effect on my day-to-day life, and yet I feel like I've been punched in the stomach. I don't cry. And yet, I'm crying. I'm fighting with people. I'm filled with a blinding rage I can't remember ever having in my life.\n\nI was 24 when I got pregnant by accident. It turns out that believing you can't get pregnant doesn't keep you from getting pregnant. My mom had a lot of trouble having me, and I just sort of assumed that I wouldn't get pregnant. So, of course, I did. Friends told me I didn't have to be a hero. They told me I was nuts to think about having the baby. My mom had me at 36. I didn't know people who had babies at 24. I knew they existed; I just didn't know any of them personally.\n\nBut I wanted to have the baby. I was engaged to someone older who was ready to have kids, and I didn't necessarily want to have a baby, but I also didn't necessarily not want to have a baby.\n\nSo I had that baby, and it was the best decision I've made in my life.\n\nBut having a child completely changed the course of my life. My life immediately stopped looking like that of my peers. I didn't go to clubs or parties. I didn't go get an office job like some of my friends. I didn't do any of the normal things people do in their 20s. I fell off the track that everyone else was on and I never got back on it. I was happy with my choice, but I was also glad that I had a choice.\n\nAfter a weekend of seeing media outlets treat the loss of Roe like everything else, I wanted to write something about how it really feels to watch the rights of my sisters being taken away. I wanted to write something about how it feels to watch the conservative Supreme Court spit on us. I am just one voice, but I want to tell you that I hear you. I understand your rage, and I feel it too."

      "text": "If the Supreme Court Can Reverse Roe , It Can Reverse Anything\n\nNo one should get used to their rights.\n\nFor months and even years I have seen this coming , and yet the reality of the Supreme Court's decision is still a shock. How can it be that people had a constitutional right for nearly half a century, and now no more? How can it not matter that Americans consistently signaled that they did not want this to happen, and even so this has happened?\n\nThe Court's answer is that Roe is different. Roe , the Court suggests, was uniquely, egregiously wrong from the beginning-a badly reasoned decision criticized by even the most ardent supporters of abortion rights, including the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The majority suggests that the best comparison to Roe (and Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the decision that saved abortion rights in 1992) is Plessy v. Ferguson , the 19th-century decision that held racial segregation to be constitutional.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nIf this decision signals anything bigger than its direct consequences, it is this: No one should get used to their rights. Predicting with certainty which ones, if any, will go, or when, is impossible. But Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a stark reminder that this can happen. Rights can vanish. The majority wants us to think otherwise. They tell us that a right to abortion is unlike other privacy rights, such as the right to marry whom you wish or to use whatever contraception you choose. Abortion, in their view, is distinct from these, because it puts someone else's life on the line. And so if we believe the Court's conservative justices, this is a reckoning about abortion and nothing more.\n\nEven if this is the case, the Court's decision is staggering. Emphasizing that no other rights will be lost-convincingly or not-suggests that there is no problem if this right disappears with the stroke of a pen. The majority opinion spends precious little time on the damage that reversing Roe will do.\n\nOften, when the Court considers whether to reverse a past decision, the justices ask whether anyone has relied on the status quo-and whether unsettling it will devastate those people. The majority in Dobbs says almost nothing about the kind of disruption that is likely to come now that Roe is gone-and ignores the possibility that people have thought differently about intimate relationships, career decisions, and even how to make ends meet based partly on the idea that abortion is available. The Court stresses that it does not care about the public's reaction to its opinion-the justices must simply do their jobs and interpret the law. The justices seem to simply not care if this decision breaks the country in two. Wrong is wrong, the justices declare. The rest hardly registers.\n\nMolly Jong-Fast: What my mom told me about America befor e Roe\n\nBut if the Court can so blithely reverse Roe- when all that has changed is that conservatives finally had the votes-we should wonder whether this is just about abortion.\n\nAfter all, this decision did not come about solely because Roe was a weakly reasoned decision. This opinion did not come down because Roe launched our culture wars (a comforting but completely ahistorical lie ). This decision reflects decades of organizing by a passionate and savvy social movement that argues that fetuses have fundamental rights-and that, in fact, the Constitution does have a view on abortion, and that view is that abortion is unconstitutional . This movement has been brilliantly successful in its efforts to control the Supreme Court, influence the rules of campaign spending, and remake the GOP.\n\nAnd America's politics have changed too. Dobbs is a product of a deeply divided country. The laws emerging from conservative states would have once seemed politically toxic, but now the gap between red and blue states has widened to the point that once-unthinkable laws are the new normal. Dobbs shows that the Supreme Court reflects and reinforces the dysfunction and ugliness of our politics-and does so at a time when faith in democratic institutions is already fraying.\n\nIn some ways, this has long been true. Progressive scholars have criticized a system in which five judges can determine which rights we have. Others have written for years that courts are not engines of social change and do not meaningfully protect constitutional values, and that the Court has, throughout its many years, been regularly partisan and out of step with popular opinion.\n\nBut until recently, there were limits on what the Court would do . Historically, the justices seemed reluctant to do anything too radical, lest they cause a backlash that damaged the power and prestige of the institution.\n\nOne might have expected any such guardrails to be particularly effective at protecting Roe , the best-known of any Supreme Court decision, and one that many Americans seem to support . The Dobbs decision makes plain that those limits are gone. In their place is a kind of constitutional partisanship, dictated by the interpretive philosophies and political priors of whoever currently has a majority on the Court and nothing more.\n\nDonald Ayer: Overturning Roe would be just the beginning\n\nThe age of Roe was not a static one. In 1973, the Supreme Court declared a right to abortion-not just for the women who wanted an abortion but also in part for the doctors who performed the procedure. But within a matter of years, that consensus fell apart, and Roe became identified more narrowly with people who have abortions and the broader women's movement. By peeling doctors away from the people Roe protected, lawmakers in red states and in Congress were able to sever abortion rights from access to the procedure, eliminating Medicaid reimbursement and then erecting a seemingly endless number of barriers to exercising the right that people theoretically had. More recently, the conversation about abortion has morphed once again: Reproductive-justice advocates, and especially activists of color, have argued that abortion should be understood neither as a matter of single-issue politics nor as a question of \"freedom of choice\" but as part of a broader social-justice agenda that helps everyone, and especially people of color, decide when to become parents and then receive support after they do.\n\nRoe v. Wade is gone, but Dobbs is not the end of the story of abortion rights in America. If anything, the past five decades have demonstrated that the Supreme Court alone cannot forever put to rest the idea of a constitutional right to abortion. The Court has a lot of power, but so do the American people, and they still have a lot more to say.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "The Conservatives Aren't Just Ending Roe -They're Delighting in It\n\nThis is the work of the Supreme Court's emboldened, radical majority.\n\nSomething fundamental about the Supreme Court has changed in recent months. It is not simply that the Court has a conservative supermajority, although that is true enough . What is really striking is just how emboldened that conservative supermajority is-how willing to take on a number of deeply divisive culture-war issues; how blasé about making major decisions via the Court's shadow docket ; how open to making rapid, profound changes to long-standing precedent. Last night, when Politico released a leaked February draft of an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito that would reverse Roe v. Wade , the landmark decision recognizing the right to choose abortion, the public got its most arresting taste thus far of just what this conservative bloc could do.\n\nThis morning the Supreme Court confirmed the authenticity of Politico 's draft. Even so, there are reasons to proceed with caution: A final decision is still not expected until June, and the language or even the conclusion of the opinion could yet change. But even with that caveat in mind, the draft is evidence of the brazenness of this majority-all in line with what many expected after oral argument in the Dobbs case in December .\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nThis draft reads like the work of a conservative majority driven by an absolute conviction that Roe v. Wade is egregiously, historically wrong-comparable to support for racial segregation. The draft claims that the justices cannot predict the consequences of their actions and, even if such a prediction were possible, shouldn't care what the public thinks anyway. The job of the Supreme Court, Alito suggests in the draft, is to say what the law is, not to care about what the people think, much less what the people think the Constitution means. ( Politico is reporting that four other conservative justices-Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett-are likely to join Alito's opinion, though that may change between now and when the final decision comes down.)\n\nThat the conservative majority could make such an argument-that it could believe such an idea-is a product of America's grievous polarization. This majority knows that it will be celebrated by the conservative legal movement and the leaders of the Republican Party.\n\nThe draft, like generations of anti-abortion-rights advocacy, stresses that Roe distorted much of American jurisprudence, not just the rules on abortion. It rehabilitates the 19th-century physicians who sought to criminalize abortion, suggesting that they were motivated by an interest in protecting innocent fetal life rather than by nativism or racism. One footnote suggests that those who fought for the right to choose abortion were motivated by racism-and argues that Roe produced a world in which fewer children of color were born. It emphasizes that abortion is different from any other constitutional right because it involves the taking of a life. These are arguments that would be made by justices who are not merely assuring the demise of abortion rights but delighting in it.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the unraveling of Roe v. Wade seemed likely. When Kavanaugh replaced Anthony Kennedy, a longtime swing vote in abortion cases, the odds of a reversal seemed even higher. And when Barrett replaced Ruth Bader Ginsburg, creating a bulletproof six-justice conservative majority, the end of abortion rights seemed imminent.\n\nBut even so, the speed with which this conservative majority is moving to reverse Roe is astonishing. The Court did not have to take this case-the lower courts had not split on the constitutionality of 15-week bans. The anti-abortion-rights movement had not invested much in such laws, which did not make for an especially strong case against abortion rights. The conservative majority is not going to sit around and wait; nothing about this seems particularly hard for these justices. No soul-searching was required.\n\nRachel Rebouché and Mary Ziegler: There's no knowing what will happen when Roe falls\n\nThis is the kind of draft that comes from that sense of certainty. It suggests that there can be no right to abortion because states were criminalizing abortion when the relevant constitutional provision, the Fourteenth Amendment, was ratified. Though the draft stresses that other precedents are not on the chopping block, it's unclear why that would be: The same logic applies to same-sex intimacy and contraception, which were being outlawed at roughly the same time.\n\nThe draft concludes that this issue should be decided by voters, not justices, but-and this is subtle but quite significant-it also distinguishes abortion from other rights the Court has protected by stressing the value of fetal life. If this language is in the final opinion, it will be read by anti-abortion-rights leaders as an invitation to return to the Court and ask the conservative justices to hold that the Constitution recognizes the personhood of the fetus-and that abortion is unconstitutional in blue as well as red states. If the Court goes that route, the issue will be far, far out of the hands of voters in all states for a very long time to come.\n\nThis draft accuses the Roe Court not just of being wrong but of lacking empathy-of moving too fast, with too little justification, and further inflaming the nation's abortion politics. This is something said by many who do not understand the nation's conflict on abortion, and in particular by those who do not want to own up to their part in the ugliness of our conflict.\n\nWe should count the Court's majority in this camp. This is more than a little ironic: The Court's conservatives may scold their predecessors for unnecessarily dividing the nation on abortion, but they are not above doing the same thing themselves.\n\nListen to the writers Molly Jong-Fast, Mary Ziegler, and David French on Radio Atlantic :"

      "text": "What Roe Could Take Down With It\n\nThe logic being used against Roe could weaken the legal foundations of many rights Americans value deeply.\n\nThe consensus of Supreme Court watchers after Wednesday's oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is that the demise of Roe v. Wade , or at least its dilution to a point that virtually any government-imposed \"burden\" on abortion would be constitutionally acceptable, is coming. After all, this Court allowed a Texas law effectively banning most abortions after six weeks to stand pending litigation, rejecting multiple pleas for a temporary stay-as clear a signal as any that at least five justices on the current Court have no problem with women's constitutional rights (as currently recognized) being violated in the interim.\n\nMany of the dangers of overruling Roe have been long discussed. If women lose the right to an abortion, pregnancy-related deaths are estimated to rise substantially and suddenly . (Currently, 26 states have so-called trigger laws on the books that would outlaw most abortions the moment the Court reverses Roe .) The impact of Roe 's fall would hit low-income women especially hard, as they're five times as likely as affluent women to experience unplanned childbearing and twice as likely to face sexual violence.\n\nThose are the dangers of restricting access to abortion. The thing is, the dangers of dispensing with Roe go far beyond abortion, because the legal logic that threatens this particular right could quite easily extend to others, inviting states to try out new laws that regulate choices about whom to marry, whom to be intimate with, what contraception to use, and how to rear one's own children.\n\nThe contention that Roe is uniquely built on a foundation of sand ignores the inconvenient fact that lots of other rights are not expressly articulated in the Constitution. The question that a reversal of Roe accordingly poses is whether the \"textualists\" and \"originalists\" on this conservative-heavy Court would allow those implied rights to go by the wayside as well.\n\nDavid H. Gans: No, really, the right to an abortion is supported by the text and history of the Constitution\n\nMost people tether Roe 's legal foundations to the right to privacy identified in Griswold v. Connecticut , a 1965 decision striking down state laws rendering illegal the use of contraceptives by married couples. The Court ultimately identified a constitutional \" right to privacy \" within protective \"penumbras\" that emanate from the Bill of Rights-in particular the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments-and reasoned that these penumbras operate to shield \"an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician's role in one aspect of that relation\" from government intrusion. Picking up on Griswold in 1973, the Court in Roe acknowledged that \"the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right to privacy,\" but seized on the earlier case's recognition of \"a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy\" to strike down a Texas law criminalizing abortion.\n\nBemoaning the analytical shortcomings of Roe , the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of gender equality under the Constitution, noted that critics were \"charging the Court with reading its own values into the due process clause.\" (In her view, \"the Court presented an incomplete justification for its decision\" and should have added \"a distinct sex discrimination theme\" to its balancing of fetal versus maternal interests.) Those charges have endured, culminating in the Dobbs case, which tees up a reversal of Roe , despite the fact that a majority of Americans across the political spectrum favor some measure of safe and legal abortion access.\n\nBut Griswold was not the Court's first word on the scope of \"liberty\" under the Fourteenth Amendment's due-process clause, which protects individuals from arbitrary governmental deprivations of \"life, liberty or property\" without articulating with any precision what the word liberty actually means. In a series of cases beginning in the early 1920s, the Court carved out a protected space for family, marriage, and children that the government is constrained from regulating. A rollback of Roe could split this sphere open if the conservative theory that implied rights are constitutionally invalid takes hold, and states begin passing draconian laws that creep into other areas of intimate personal life.\n\nAs a pro-life obstetric sonographer, Rebecca Shrader saw abortion as a black-and-white issue. But after she became pregnant, she found herself in the gray area. Listen on The Experiment .\n\nConsider the 1923 case Meyer v. Nebraska , in which the Court struck down a law criminalizing the teaching of German in private schools. \"The obvious purpose of this statute,\" the Court wrote, \"was that the English language should be and become the mother tongue of all children reared in this state.\" Although its enactment \"comes reasonably within the police power of the state,\" the Court found that the law \"unreasonably infringes the liberty guaranteed to the plaintiff in error by the Fourteenth Amendment\"-the precise grounding of the now-precarious individual right to decide whether to carry a fetus to term. Two years later, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary , the Court struck down an Oregon criminal law forcing parents to send their children to public school. \"The manifest purpose\" of the law, the Court noted, \"is to compel general attendance at public schools by normal children, between eight and sixteen, who have not completed the eighth grade.\" Citing Meyer , the Court ruled, \"We think it entirely plain that the Act of 1922 unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children.\"\n\nMary Ziegler: The end of Roe\n\nThe Court has construed liberty to safeguard numerous other personal safe spaces: the right to marry regardless of race (1967's Loving v. Virginia ) and sex (2015's Obergefell v. Hodges ). The right to use contraception ( Griswold ). The right to be free from compulsory sterilization by the state (1942's S kinner v. Oklahom a ). The right to be free of government-mandated surgery involving \"a virtually total divestment of respondent's ordinary control over surgical probing beneath his skin\" (1985's Winston v. Lee ). And the right to engage in intimate sexual conduct with a partner of one's choice without fear of criminal prosecution (2003's Lawrence v. Texas ).\n\nIn Dobbs , the state of Mississippi's answer to this line of cases is to suggest that the life of an unborn fetus is especially sacred under the Constitution: \"Nowhere else in the law does a right of privacy or right to make personal decisions provide a right to destroy a human life,\" it claims . But saying so does not mean that critics of other privacy-based rights could not find their own reasons why those rights, too, must be balanced against some other competing interest.\n\nThus, to say that Roe is a one-off constitutional blunder, built on a flimsy foundation, while other rights are grounded in concrete, is a myth-and a dangerous one. Nothing in the Constitution says anything to specifically protect couples' ability to choose to have sex, use contraception, get married, decide how to educate their children, refuse bodily inspection or medical treatments, and, yes, terminate a pregnancy. From a legal perspective, if Roe falls, it's hard to see what else will still stand."

      "text": "The Myth That Roe Broke America\n\nThe debate over abortion is an important part of the story of polarization in American politics, but it is not its genesis.\n\nThe idea that American politics became bitter and divisive because of Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, is a cherished bit of right-wing folk history, akin to the idea that Robert E. Lee opposed slavery or that the purpose of the Electoral College was to protect small states from the tyranny of big states . Like any political use of history, its purpose is to justify the use of power to achieve a desired end-in this case, the overturning of Roe and the elimination of women's right to decide whether and when they have a child.\n\nIn his draft opinion overturning the decision, Justice Samuel Alito laments that Roe \"sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for half a century.\" In classic Alito fashion, the justice contradicts himself later in the opinion, arguing that the justices cannot consider how society would be affected by Roe being overturned, insisting, \"We would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision.\" Alito's defenders and fellow travelers have echoed this reasoning. The New York Times columnist Ross Douthat described the decision as \"an inflection point where the choices of elite liberalism actively pushed the Republic toward our current divisions, our age of chronic strife.\"\n\nRead: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nRoe is an important part of the story of polarization in American politics, but it is not its genesis. \"The idea that Roe kickstarted polarization is a really dramatic oversimplification,\" Mary Ziegler , a law professor at UC Davis and the author of the forthcoming Dollars for Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement and the Fall of the Republican Establishment , told me. \"If people are genuinely upset about polarization, presenting Roe as the source of that denies that a lot of other people had responsibility. There were a lot of politicians, activists, media figures, and lawyers who deepened the divide on abortion and benefited from it.\"\n\nThe notion that Roe is solely or largely responsible for polarization and bitterness in American politics is an ideal just-so story for anti-abortion advocates who wish to celebrate its destruction, but that story bears little resemblance to history as it actually occurred-it is an argument that rests on wiping the 1960s from public memory as easily as you delete a botched photo from an iPhone. The right-wing counter-mobilization against the Supreme Court had already begun as early as the Brown v. Board of Education decision striking down segregated schools, and the parties had begun sorting into more coherent ideological blocs as a result of the realignment of conservative Southern Democrats into the Republican Party. Abortion was already a divisive issue when Roe was decided, but in the immediate aftermath of that decision, activists on each side of the issue cooperated on proposals to support mothers more than they ever have since. The \"bitterness\" of the abortion debate is not a cause of polarization, but its result.\n\n\"At an elite level, the parties remained internally divided on abortion until the early 2000s-30 years after Roe and the emergence of polarization on most other issues,\" Nolan McCarty, a Princeton University political-science professor and a co-author of Polarized America , told me. \"Within Congress, partisan divisions were much clearer on taxes, regulation, and labor policy than on abortion.\"\n\nThe conservative Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan wrote last week that \"other high court decisions that liberalized the social order-desegregation of schools, elimination of prayer in the schools, interracial marriage, gay marriage-were followed by public acceptance, even when the rulings were very unpopular.\" Saying the Supreme Court's decisions on school prayer and integration were followed by \"public acceptance\" is a little like saying that the South welcomed the election of Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\"Ultimately, Roe was used to mobilize evangelical voters who had very conservative ideas about racial and gender equality,\" Lilliana Hall Mason, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the author of Uncivil Agreement , told me. \"When those voters joined the Republican Party, it continued the process of realignment that began after the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s.\"\n\nSouthern politicians infamously responded to the Brown decision with a campaign of \"massive resistance,\" by attempting to thwart integration through violence, by passing laws making desegregation illegal, and by privatizing their school systems-a campaign backed by conservative organs such as National Review . Segregationist Democrats such as George Wallace attacked the justices as \"omnipotent black-robed despots,\" while Republicans such as Richard Nixon refined southern-style criticisms of the Court into more neutral-sounding language. Nixon outmaneuvered his more conservative rival Ronald Reagan for the GOP presidential nomination in 1968 partly by reassuring the segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond that he was the best hope of bringing a \"power-grasping Supreme Court\" to heel. Conservatives turned the Warren Court's decisions on criminal justice into a way to attack the civil-rights movement without defending Jim Crow directly. Nor could anyone seriously describe the politics of the 1960s as tame, with the civil-rights movement and the anti-war movement, and extremism that generated a long list of bombings and assassinations.\n\nMichele Goodwin: The new Jane Crow\n\nIn the 1960s, abortion was a divisive matter but not a partisan one-the ideological valences of the issue were not yet clear. In 1972, a year before Roe , conservatives attacked Nixon's Democratic rival, George McGovern, as the candidate of \"acid, amnesty, and abortion,\" hoping to damage his standing among Catholic voters. Ironically, McGovern's position at the time was Alito's-that abortion was an issue for the states. Nixon, for his part, privately acknowledged there were moments when he believed abortion was \"necessary,\" such as \"when you have a black and a white, or a rape.\" In The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement , Steven Teles quotes a memo written by the Nixon aide Pat Buchanan, in which Buchanan voiced his hope that his boss's appointees to the high court had halted its \"social experimentation.\"\n\n\"There was an intense conflict about abortion before Roe ,\" Ziegler told me. \"This partly reflected a more general, prolonged partisan realignment that began in the 1960s and reshaped party identification in the 1980s, congressional elections in the 1990s, and state legislative races in the 2010s. But the parties' positions on abortion were diverging too. It's not that Roe doesn't matter, but the polarization of the parties is already happening for different reasons.\"\n\nNixon's Supreme Court appointees-three of whom supported Roe -were simply not ideological enough to suit many conservatives. This was one of the catalysts for the modern conservative legal movement, for which the overturning of Roe would be a crowning achievement. But that movement, which emerged in opposition to liberal legal victories on religious freedom, criminal justice, and business regulation, was slow to embrace overturning Roe as a cause, Ziegler said. Some of its members were ambivalent about the issue-many of them were ideologically anti-statist; some were uncomfortable with the state interfering with such personal decisions.\n\n\"The idea that opposition to abortion went together with free markets and anti-communism was not clear in the 1970s,\" Teles told me. \"The kind of decisions Nixon and the people around him thought they were going to change were more like Miranda than Griswold ,\" he said, meaning that they were more frustrated with the Warren Court's criminal-justice jurisprudence than the 1965 decision guaranteeing married couples the right to use contraception.\n\nSimilarly, some Democrats openly expressed their opposition to abortion rights. In 1977, the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson wrote that \"if one accepts the position that life is private, and therefore you have the right to do with it as you please, one must also accept the conclusion of that logic. That was the premise of slavery.\" But by the 1980s, as he prepared to run for the Democratic nomination for president, although Jackson was still expressing his personal opposition to abortion, he was also insisting that the state should not interfere.\n\nIn the aftermath of Roe , Ziegler has written , anti-abortion activists supported legislation barring discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and advocated for state-supported child-care services and sex education. On the other side, she writes, \"members of Congress and some organizations supportive of abortion rights endorsed limited protections for fetuses that did not conflict with a woman's abortion decision. Pro-choice activists debated the propriety of fetal rights in the context of scientific experimentation and late-term abortion.\"\n\nThose early points of convergence became a casualty of the polarization that was already well under way. Republican activists such as Paul Weyrich saw abortion as a promising wedge issue to split the Democratic coalition, which included many working-class Catholics. As the abortion-rights and anti-abortion movements became more aligned with a single party, they adopted the ideological assumptions of their comrades.\n\n\"In forging a working relationship with social conservatives, abortion opponents took more extreme and consistently right-wing positions on a number of gender issues. In response, pro-choice leaders expressed skepticism about any effort to recognize fetal rights,\" Ziegler writes . \"For reasons having little to do with the Court, movement members, politicians, and political operatives deliberately and consistently made decisions that intensified abortion conflict.\" Blaming Roe for \"embittering\" American politics ignores those who profited from that very outcome.\n\nWhen conservatives talk about Roe , a decision they loathe, they engage in the common tic of conflating their own views with those of the public. In this case, because Roe is a decision they find uniquely abhorrent, they assume that same view is shared by the majority of Americans-certainly those they consider \"real\" Americans . But the irony of this argument is that the decision in Roe , by finding a constitutional right to abortion while allowing some restrictions, is far closer to reflecting Americans' ambivalence on the matter than Alito's leaked draft opinion is.\n\nAs my colleague Jerusalem Demsas writes , \"The number of people favoring legal abortion under any circumstance has consistently outstripped the number of those wanting it to be illegal under any circumstance since 1975. But the broad center of public opinion says that abortion should be legal only 'under certain circumstances.'\" Unlike other issues, that divide has remained stable since the 1950s. Only the composition of the Supreme Court has changed.\n\nRead: When a right becomes a privilege\n\nIf the argument is that Roe was the origin of today's partisan polarization by settling a profound moral argument too early, or that it went against the preferences of the majority, then conservatives should be worried. Because if that's true, then the backlash to a decision overturning Roe will ultimately be massive . But perhaps Republican confidence about being able to weather a post- Roe backlash has more to do with GOP success at election-proofing state legislatures through gerrymandering than the delusion that criminalizing abortion is popular. Having limited the ability of voters to throw anti-abortion lawmakers out of office, Republicans may present their continuing majorities as proof of post- Roe harmony. Indeed, the fantasy that Roe sparked polarization, and the implied logic that getting rid of it will heal the divide, can be read less as a hopeful prediction than as a demand for surrender.\n\nSkeptical as I am about the conservative narrative on Roe , however, I do not know if there will be a big backlash. The Democratic Party's politics in the Biden era are of strategic retreat from any controversial matter, ceding the field to a Republican advance, in the hopes that voters will independently decide that the GOP is too extreme to support.\n\nI am more certain that the regime of state surveillance , prosecution , and incarceration that Republicans are planning in the event that Ro e is overturned dwarfs anything that existed before the decision, and seems likely to reach beyond abortion to contraception , especially given that conservatives define some contraceptives as \"abortion-inducing drugs.\" Those with an understandable moral ambivalence about abortion may find themselves nonetheless horrified by grieving mothers being investigated by cops after a miscarriage or state authorities combing through social media for evidence of illegal travel across state lines. Enforcing bans on abortion will require extreme violations of personal freedom that until now have been abstract. Other nations with strict abortion bans have found that those violations were too frequent and too harsh to justify.\n\nAs Jessica Valenti notes, contrary to conservative stereotypes , most women who have an abortion-about a quarter of all women- are already mothers , concerned about being able to care for children they already have. The consistent conservative hostility to expansions of the welfare state suggests that recent claims that Republicans might back state support for such mothers in the aftermath of Roe 's hypothetical demise are just rhetoric meant to shield the party from accusations of callousness. The only states with paid family leave are those with few restrictions on abortion.\n\nPerhaps class divides would soften the potential political repercussions of overturning Roe , with middle- and upper-class women receiving medication in discreet brown packages, while poor women face burdens of access that leave them more vulnerable to prosecution and incarceration. Whatever the outcome, the \"bitterness\" surrounding the issue seems unlikely to subside.\n\n\"People with opposing views on abortion did not have those views because of Roe ; they had them before Roe , and Roe did not convince them they were wrong,\" Ziegler told me. \"Getting rid of Roe isn't going to convince them they were wrong either.\""

      "text": "How Roe Undermined Itself\n\nThoughts after oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health\n\nAs I listened to almost two hours of oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health , a case challenging Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks, I kept returning to a single thought: Ruth Bader Ginsburg was right. She accurately identified the inherent instability of Roe v. Wade . Because of that instability, it is now quite possible that Roe will be overturned and the ultimate legality of abortion rights will be decided by legislatures, not justices.\n\nWhen I say \"Ginsburg was right,\" I'm referring specifically to fascinating comments she made during a Madison Lecture at New York University in 1992, the year before Bill Clinton nominated her to serve on the Supreme Court. In a section of her lecture devoted to \"measured motions in third branch decisionmaking,\" she made two observations of enduring significance.\n\nFirst, she quoted Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who argued that \"judges do and must legislate,\" but they must do so \"only interstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular motions.\" In plain language this means that judges don't merely interpret laws, they write laws, but when they do so, they should do so slowly and cautiously. Otherwise, as Ginsburg argued, \"Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable.\"\n\nSecond, as her prime example of this principle, she chose Roe v. Wade , a precedent she called \"breathtaking\" and contrasted directly with the Court's \"more cautious dispositions\" in cases \"contemporaneous with Roe \" that involved questions of sex discrimination. She noted that the Roe Court did not have to rewrite all of the nation's abortion laws at a stroke. There was a narrower path, and that narrower path may have been more prudent.\n\nShe called the Texas law at issue in Roe the \"most extreme brand\" of anti-abortion law in the nation (it blocked all abortions except those performed as a \"life-saving\" procedure for the mother). \"Suppose the Court had stopped there,\" she mused, and contented itself only with striking down Texas's law and did not \"displace virtually every state law then in force\"? Would we have seen the same level of controversy?\n\nGinsburg's words did not mean that she wished to reverse Roe , and she went on to defend abortion rights at the high court, but in that brief 1992 musing she forecast precisely why Roe had such a rough day today, and why it appears-based on the questions presented at the oral argument-that five justices at least seem open to reversing the case and leaving most abortion decisions to state legislatures and/or Congress. Her two observations about Roe are summed up in two crucial words- legislate and breathtaking .\n\nThe word legislate refers to a key difference between most progressive and most conservative judicial philosophies. Judges steeped in originalism or textualism (philosophies more or less identified with most modern Republican nominees) most definitely do not believe judges should legislate . That is the role of Congress. According to an originalist philosophy, the justices interpret the words of the Constitution and try to resolve ambiguities in their meaning by reference to what's called the \"original public meaning\" of the text-what the text was reasonably perceived to mean at the time it was enacted.\n\nMore progressive constitutional philosophies do also pay attention to text. It's a straw man to argue that the text or the original public meaning doesn't matter at all to a more progressive jurist (Justice Ginsburg herself wrote opinions that read a lot like originalism ).\n\nRather, a better way of describing more progressive judicial philosophies is that the Constitution contains both a textual and a philosophical imperative. For example, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the 1992 case that reaffirmed the most essential holding of Roe , the Court's opinion contained this famous phrase : \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\"\n\nAn originalist recoils at this language and might respond, \"The definition of the heart of liberty is an interesting philosophical question, but it is not a judicial question. The judicial question is whether the text of the Fourteenth Amendment protects a right to an abortion.\" And since the Constitution does not mention abortion at all-and since there is insufficient evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment was understood at the time it was ratified to protect abortion rights-then abortion is a matter left to the democratic process.\n\nSo if Roe is-as Ginsburg noted-more legislative, and a majority of the Court rejects that vision of judicial decision making, then Roe is toast, right?\n\nNot necessarily. This is where stare decisis (the power of previous precedent) comes into play. Stare decisis is the concept that prevents each new justice from using the law as their own personal playpen, voting to overrule every precedent they oppose. A degree of stability is necessary to the rule of law.\n\nBut stare decisis is merely a cautionary principle at the Supreme Court. It's not a formal legal barrier that blocks Court action. And thank goodness for that. Otherwise we'd be left with some of the worst rulings in Supreme Court history as the law of the land. During the Dobbs oral argument Justice Kavanaugh recited case after case (including Brown v. Board of Education ) where the Court repaired damage to our nation's constitutional structure by reversing harmful Supreme Court precedent.\n\nAnd that brings us to the word breathtaking . Throughout the oral argument, defenders of Roe argued that reversing the case would be disruptive, that women have relied on the precedent to guarantee access to abortion for almost 50 years. Yet Ginsburg's 1992 remarks demonstrate that Roe itself was also disruptive. It completely ruptured the prior legal regime, and our nation has been living with the fallout ever since.\n\nBut breathtaking has a double implication. If you examine the jurisprudence of the nine justices, the six Republican appointees reject-to greater and lesser degrees-the concept of judge as legislator. At the same time-again, to greater and lesser degrees-a number of those same justices also tend to prefer narrow rulings over broad rulings and incremental changes over shocks to the legal system. They're sometimes apt to nudge, rather than shove, Court precedent toward originalism.\n\nAfter listening to the oral argument, if Roe is to survive, that's how it will survive. The Court will choose to nudge. But don't be surprised by a shove. Why? Because at least five justices may well believe a prior progressive majority shoved first. They made the first \"breathtaking\" move, and the Court can't simply continue to consent to such blatantly legislative jurisprudence.\n\nIf the Court reverses Roe , it won't do so because the majority hates women or views women as second-class citizens. Indeed, a woman would almost certainly be in the Court's majority, and the Court would leave intact the ability of legislatures to protect abortion rights. Instead it will be because the majority embraces a constitutional order that limits the power of the judiciary to write laws and expands the power of the people to define the heart of liberty for themselves."

      "text": "How to Save Women's Lives After Roe\n\nA federal law exists that could protect women having life-threatening pregnancy complications-but only if the Biden administration decides to use it.\n\nIn February, NPR reported a story of a woman, Anna, who went into labor at 19 weeks, far too early for her child to survive outside the womb. This is a condition known as \"preterm premature rupture of membranes\" (PPROM), and in many cases the medically recommended treatment is abortion. Attempting to delay labor long enough to reach a point where the baby could survive can mean risking infection , sepsis , and death .\n\nUnfortunately, Anna lived in Texas, where the state's abortion law, S.B. 8 , has effectively outlawed abortion after six weeks. As a result, the hospital-and consequently, her doctors-concluded that they could not treat her. They found a provider in Colorado and discussed whether it was safer for Anna to board an airplane or endure a long car trip, given her ongoing medical emergency. They settled on an airplane and developed a plan in case she needed to deliver her baby in the plane's bathroom.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nShe survived the flight, made it to Colorado, and had her abortion. But the horrifying reality is that, as awful as this was for her, it could have been far worse.\n\nAnna is far from the only Texan whose life has been threatened by Texas's strict abortion law. We know of a handful of other cases where Texas patients with PPROM have been forced out of state to get a medically indicated abortion. And other media outlets have reported that Texans with ectopic pregnancies-a nonviable pregnancy that can become life-threatening at any moment-have had to drive 12 to 15 hours out of state to get an abortion when a heartbeat is present.\n\nTo be clear: This is how women will die in a post- Roe America. But there is a federal statute that the Biden administration could use to try to save lives.\n\nThe law is called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). It was passed by Congress in 1986 and requires all hospitals with an emergency department that accept Medicare or Medicaid, and the physicians who work at these hospitals, to provide stabilizing treatment to any patient who is in labor or experiencing a medical emergency. The law was originally passed as an anti-patient-dumping statute designed to prevent hospitals from turning away uninsured patients; to do so, it created the obligation for emergency departments to treat medical emergencies regardless of a patient's ability to pay. But the statute's obligations go beyond this original purpose, and the Biden administration could use it to create legal risk for hospitals that deny lifesaving abortion care.\n\nBecause EMTALA is a federal law, it trumps state laws , including state abortion laws, and its definition of a medical emergency therefore trumps a life-or-health exception in any state abortion ban. Such exceptions in state abortion laws are typically quite narrow and create uncertainty for providers about when the pregnant person's life is threatened enough to justify an abortion. For example, in the case of ectopic pregnancies, some hospitals and physicians will wait to intervene until after the pregnancy ruptures, causing the mother to hemorrhage and to be at immediate risk of dying, even though this outcome could have been prevented.\n\nEMTALA's definition of a medical emergency is broader and includes any person in labor or suffering from a condition that, without immediate attention, could be reasonably expected to seriously jeopardize their health, impair a bodily function, or cause dysfunction in an organ. This definition covers many urgent pregnancy conditions, including PPROM, ectopic pregnancy, and complications from incomplete miscarriage or self-managed abortion . Because EMTALA has broader protections for patients and supersedes state law, it can be used to protect patients and their health even in states with extremely restrictive abortion laws.\n\nUnder EMTALA, once the hospital has determined that an emergency condition exists, it must provide stabilizing treatment-by law. In many of these medical emergencies that arise in a previable pregnancy, the only way to stabilize the patient is with surgical or medical interventions that will terminate the pregnancy. Though EMTALA does permit hospitals to transfer patients in some circumstances, if the patient is not yet stabilized, they can be transferred only upon patient request or if the medical benefits outweigh the risks. A state law or policy cannot be the justification for an out-of-state transfer.\n\nMichele Goodwin: The new Jane Crow\n\nThe Biden administration, through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), issued a memo in response to S.B. 8 that attempted to highlight the obligation of hospitals and physicians to treat patients under EMTALA. But it was ambiguous and tepid. As a result, people like Anna are being denied lifesaving abortion care, and at some point, one of them will likely die, as has happened in other countries .\n\nThe Biden administration can and must do more. First, the CMS memo never included the word abortion -a persistent issue in the Biden administration's communications-causing unnecessary confusion. Rather, it focused on patients \"experiencing pregnancy loss.\" It's true that in the cases where EMTALA would apply, a pregnancy loss is in process or inevitable without an abortion, but hospitals could use this language as an excuse to delay abortion care until after the fetus's heart has stopped. This is not the time to obfuscate. The next communication with hospitals must state with perfect clarity that when a medical emergency is present and stabilizing care would involve an abortion, it must be offered immediately regardless of state law. The Biden administration must also communicate that the failure to adhere to these legal obligations will result in an enforcement action.\n\nSecond, the administration must actually enforce the statute. Hospitals and doctors in Texas are currently operating out of fear that they will get sued for providing abortions unless the patient's condition becomes so dire that death is imminent without it. They are adopting the Catholic-hospital approach : wait and perform the abortion only when the patient is on death's door. This approach could be replicated in all states that ban abortion, resulting in totally avoidable tragedy.\n\nHospitals are already preparing for institutional policy changes if state abortion laws change. However, having restrictive policies that are at odds with the EMTALA obligation to stabilize patients leaves doctors in the tenuous position of balancing conflicting laws and policies in real time. Hospitals must understand that any delays beyond medical necessity create legal risk in the other direction as well, unless an informed patient would prefer to wait. Hospitals that permit medically necessary abortions when EMTALA is triggered will be supporting their physicians, instead of leaving them to make these difficult decisions that threaten their medical license and livelihood on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAdmittedly, enforcement depends on patients filing complaints. But CMS can make its complaint process more user-friendly and do a better job spreading public awareness of how to file complaints, so that it can act. (Additionally, the Biden administration is not the only mechanism for enforcing EMTALA. Patients can also sue hospitals for breaching their EMTALA duties. But because of the confluence of abortion stigma and the trauma of a medical emergency, many patients will not have the wherewithal to endure the challenges of litigation.)\n\nThe post- Roe world will be disastrous and chaotic . EMTALA will not make the overwhelming majority of abortions legal in anti-abortion states or stop the coming parade of horribles. But it could save lives and reduce unnecessary carnage. For it to work as it could, though, the Biden administration needs to wield the statute as a sword. Even in a post- Roe America, no state should be able to scare hospitals into denying lifesaving abortion care."

      "text": "Overturning Roe Would Be Just the Beginning\n\nA self-assured right-wing majority may be ready to radically alter our legal system and destroy the public's trust in the Supreme Court and the law.\n\nShould the Supreme Court's final ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization resemble Justice Samuel Alito's leaked draft opinion, it will be an unprecedented moment in the annals of the Court. Never before has the Court reversed its own decisions in order to completely eliminate a recognized constitutional right protecting personal conduct-and here one that thousands of people turn to every year. Probably on that account, the overwhelming majority of the American people oppose the action that the Court seems ready to take , which appears likely to lead in the near future to laws totally banning or tightly restricting abortion access in more than half of U.S. states .\n\nBut perhaps even more significant than the demise of Roe is what the leaked opinion suggests about where the present Court may be headed. Following the addition of three Donald Trump-appointed justices through nomination processes that were at best highly irregular , five justices now on the Court appear to be in general agreement about the major tenets of a judicial philosophy at odds with much recent Court history. That these five justices also seem to share both great confidence in the correctness of their own views and a militant lack of concern about the effects of sudden change on the public's respect for the Court and the law warns of serious ramifications for the weeks and years ahead.\n\nAdrienne LaFrance: Liberty no more\n\nThe five justices appear to agree that the legitimate role of justices on the Court is largely confined to the objective application of law to facts, and also believe that jurists who make choices to resolve perceived ambiguities in the law are engaged in legislative conduct beyond their judicial authority. For constitutional law, this allegedly objective approach to judging means seeking out the original meaning of the Constitution -that is, figuring out what was meant by words written long ago with regard to modern realities of which the Founders (and later drafters) were totally unaware. Justice Alito's leaked opinion, on behalf of five justices, exemplifies this latter approach-because no right of abortion is specifically mentioned in the Constitution, the argument goes, the Supreme Court's recognition of such a right cannot possibly be proper.\n\nPerhaps the scariest passage in the leaked opinion comes in a discussion of the plurality opinion in 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which had noted that, even if Roe was wrong, stare decisis commands adherence to its \"central holding\" that a state may not protect fetal life before viability, because failing to do so would undermine respect for the Court and the rule of law. To the five-justice conservative majority, this is nonsense: \"We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as the concern about the public's reaction to our work. In suggesting otherwise, the Casey plurality went beyond this Court's role in our constitutional system.\" If the approach of this opinion holds, the Supreme Court will at once erase the right to an abortion and, in that very same decision, declare that the Court is foreclosed even from considering the consequences of that action on the public's trust in the Court and the rule of law.\n\nThe plausibility of any claim that a Supreme Court justice should apply their view of the law without regard to how the public will react fades quickly when considered in the context of an impending decision to abolish a long-established constitutional right-or to take any other action that will materially disrupt the predictability and continuity of legal rights and duties. The Court cannot both be the willful instigator of radical changes in the law based simply on disagreement with the views of prior justices, and remain the faithful steward of a legal system that commands widespread trust and respect.\n\nAnd new justices disagreeing with their predecessors is exactly what is happening here. The plurality opinion of three Republican-appointed justices in Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion as a form of liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's language, which says that no person shall be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" The Court's repeated reliance on the due-process clause as a basis for recognizing substantive rights has long been attacked by advocates of supposedly objective, value-free jurisprudence, because the precise content of the protected activities remains to be defined by judges. In the leaked opinion, Alito, who disagrees from the start with reliance on the due-process clause as a source of substantive rights, nonetheless purports to reject the Casey plurality's reasoning without disputing its fundamental premises. He does that by rewriting the history of abortion that he says was misstated in Roe , and concluding that a right to abortion is not essential to our nation's scheme of ordered liberty and thus cannot be protected under the decisions that recognized liberty interests protected under the due-process clause.\n\nConcerns about loss of trust based on sudden radical changes instituted by a new group of justices are not answered by those justices claiming the mantle of objectivity and purporting simply to be interpreting the words of texts and applying a discernible original meaning of constitutional provisions. Sudden major changes in basic rights or rules that result directly from a change in judicial personnel are a problem regardless of the theory invoked to justify them.\n\nMore fundamentally, though, any random selection of Supreme Court decisions disproves the claim that the interpretive tools of original meaning and textual literalism actually offer a value-free way for the Court to resolve the cases before it. That is mainly because the tiny percent of filed cases that the Court actually decides are those presenting the most-difficult legal issues, where multiple courts have disagreed and no simple resolution is possible.\n\nJessica Bruder: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nAlso, many texts are ambiguous, and constitutional provisions written more than 100 or 200 years ago have, at best, uncertain intended meanings when applied to the circumstances of modern life. On top of that, many of the most important constitutional provisions-freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, equal protection of the laws, and the prohibitions on unreasonable search and seizure, and on cruel or unusual punishment, for example-provide protection for rights of a certain type that is not unlimited, and whose boundaries are necessarily determined by courts. That can be done only by balancing interests and making sometimes difficult choices, activities that are anathema to advocates of value-free judging.\n\nThe Alito opinion's categorical denial that it, like every other Supreme Court decision, is actually making value choices, and should be attentive to the impact of those choices on public trust and respect for the Court and its work, raises two substantial concerns about where the new majority's constellation of convictions is likely to lead.\n\nFirst, the right embodied in Roe and Casey rests on certain ideas about personal privacy that support a collection of other Supreme Court decisions concerning intimate personal and sexual activity, and protecting activities such as contraception use , gay sexual conduct , and interracial and gay marriage . Much of what is said in the leaked opinion demonstrates forcefully the majority's disagreement with the legal foundation of these rights, and, as the solicitor general argued to the Court, overruling Roe and Casey would seem to \"threaten the Court's precedents holding that the Due Process Clause protects other rights.\" The opinion emphatically asserts that abortion is different because another life is involved. But that assurance is little comfort, given the tone and tenor of the present opinion, and the clarity of the majority's disagreement with the very foundations of the entire right to privacy.\n\nSecond, even more consequentially, as has been apparent at least since some quite radical decisions were handed down last term , the five justices listed as joining Alito's opinion are likely to spearhead changes going far beyond the elimination of these particular rights. Indeed, the greatest threat posed by the new majority involves not eliminating individual rights but elevating newly expanded rights so that they are free from government action, and narrowly reading or invalidating existing remedial statutes, thus impairing the ability of government at both the state and federal levels to function and meet the needs of our challenging times.\n\nAlready this term, the five-justice majority, joined by the chief justice, has championed the right to be free from vaccination requirements and has read the statute that created OSHA in an extraordinarily narrow manner to block the agency from mandating vaccination of the employees of major firms. Just recently, following in the path of recent decisions invalidating electoral spending limitations on First Amendment grounds, the same majority struck down an act of Congress limiting to $250,000 the amount that candidates can be repaid when they loan money to their own campaign. In the Court's view, the corrupt appearance of very substantial post-campaign contributions going directly into the elected official's pocket to repay a loan was insufficient to justify the limitation enacted by Congress-a value judgment if there ever was one. And pending on the docket, with a decision expected this month, is a case in which the five joiners of the leaked opinion are expected to lighten the regulatory burden on electric power plants by reading narrowly the statutory powers of the EPA, thus dramatically reducing its ability to protect the nation's clean air and take action to stave off climate change.\n\nAlso teed up for decision this month is a Second Amendment case in which a lower court upheld a New York State law requiring evidence of good cause to obtain a license to carry a gun outside the home. Commonsense provisions like this, aimed at addressing our raging epidemic of gun violence, have been enacted in many states. And they have so far been regarded as in line with the 2008 Heller decision , which stated that the Second Amendment does not allow a person to \"keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\" Nevertheless, the oral-argument transcript suggests that the five-justice majority is likely ready to find even these minimal constraints on gun ownership incompatible with the Founders' original meaning.\n\nJohn Paul Stevens: The Supreme Court's worst decision of my tenure\n\nThis term's cases using personal rights to hamstring governmental action build on a number of cases from the previous term, in which the same majority acted in the same way. Among those cases were opinions second-guessing the preeminent powers of state and local government over health and safety policies in order to invalidate rules governing the size of assemblies deemed to offend the free-exercise right to assemble in church. These were the latest and most extreme instances of the conservative justices' recognition of an extraordinarily broad right of free exercise, which has been applied directly and through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, including one case last term that limited governments' ability to impose generally applicable requirements of many types. On top of this, the justices also sharply narrowed the key remaining enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAnd so it goes. Opportunities for a willful Court to have its way and fix what it sees as the errors of the past will be limited only by the lawsuits that eager litigants decide to pursue. Already on the docket for next term are two cases in which major Court precedents are on the line, and the views of the Alito-opinion five now seem quite predictable. One concerns the breadth of federal power to regulate the waters of the United States. The other may settle, by flat-out rejection, the fate of affirmative action in higher education, which has occupied the Court in a profoundly important series of nuanced rulings since the 1970s.\n\nMany more cases like these will come. The question is whether enough justices will have the wisdom to realize that their certainty in the correctness of their legal reasoning must be tempered by an awareness that too much change too fast will destroy the public's respect for the Court and the rule of law. Recent history raises doubt that any will have even a moment's hesitation."

      "text": "It's Official: The Supreme Court Has Overturned Roe v. Wade\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nNearly half a century after the Supreme Court ruled that the ability to end a pregnancy was a constitutional right, the nation's highest court has overturned Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled that the 1973 decision was wrong in its determination that an implied right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution protected a patient's decision to have an abortion.\n\n\"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled,\" Alito wrote for the 6-3 majority. \"The authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decision effectively ends abortion access for roughly 40 million women and girls in nearly two dozen states across the country. Thirteen of those states have pre-emptively enacted \"trigger laws\" intended to impose severe restrictions on the procedure in the event of a Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe . Others have pre- Roe bans that remain on the books or have passed subsequent laws that have been blocked by federal courts.\n\nMost of the laws, many of which take immediate effect , make exceptions only in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if an abortion is necessary to save a patient's life.\n\nThe ruling is the culmination of five decades of legal, political, and social action by abortion opponents, whose previous efforts to impose limitations on the procedure were stymied by Supreme Court precedent. A similar case brought before the court in 1992, Casey v. Planned Parenthood , reaffirmed the protections provided in Roe .\n\nBut a shift in the Supreme Court's composition during the Trump administration gave hope to abortion opponents that justices could rule to overturn Roe .\n\nAlito was joined in the opinion by Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh , and Clarence Thomas, all of whom were nominated to the court by Republican presidents. Chief Justice John Roberts concurred with the judgment in a separate opinion.\n\nAs the decision came down, anti-abortion groups began yelling in excitement. Champagne was popped and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) could be seen in the crowd celebrating. \"Did I hear that correctly?\" Marina Mason, a staffer with Students for Life, asked The Daily Beast in front of the court. \"I'm so happy... it's amazing.\"\n\n\"I'm thrilled. I'm overjoyed,\" Greene told The Daily Beast while being mobbed by hecklers yelling, \"My body, my choice!\"\n\nAn emotional President Joe Biden called it \"the realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , began winding its way through the federal court system four years ago when Mississippi's sole abortion clinic sought to overturn a 2018 law that banned abortions performed after 15 weeks of gestation. Lower courts, in keeping with precedent, successively determined that the law violated Roe 's abortion protections.\n\nThe landmark decision in Dobbs comes seven weeks after a draft of the majority opinion was leaked to Politico . That draft, confirmed to be authentic by Roberts shortly after its release in early May, follows nearly verbatim the final ruling issued on Friday.\n\nThe majority likened the overturning of Roe , considered a \"superprecedent\" in some legal circles, to some of the Supreme Court's \"most important decisions\" reversing previous rulings, including the overturning of Plessy v. Ferguson , which found racial segregation to be constitutional, with Brown v. Board of Education .\n\n\"Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided,\" the majority wrote. \"Those on the losing side-those who sought to advance the State's interest in fetal life-could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe .\"\n\nIn their dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan declared that the majority's ruling \"says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.\"\n\n\"With sorrow-for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection-we dissent,\" the minority wrote. \"As of today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare.\"\n\nWriting in a separate concurrence , Thomas declared that with Roe overturned, the Supreme Court should now \"reconsider\" a host of other major cases predicated on the 14th Amendment's implication of a right to privacy, including recent rulings that protected the right to contraception and same-sex marriage.\n\n\"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell ,\" Thomas wrote, referring to Supreme Court rulings that legalized contraception access, sex between two people of the same gender, and same-sex marriage. \"We have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\"\n\nThe real-world consequences of the ruling began almost immediately. In Missouri, Attorney General Eric Schmitt waited less than half an hour to sign an opinion determining that with Roe 's overturning, a 2019 trigger law banning nearly all abortions in the state now goes into effect.\n\n\"Missouri has just become the first in the country to effectively end abortion,\" Schmitt said in a statement announcing the opinion. \"This is a monumental day for the sanctity of life.\"\n\nPublication of the draft opinion sparked a national uproar over what appeared to be Roe 's imminent demise, although supporters of abortion rights gained little ground in the weeks before the final decision was released. Congressional Democrats tried and failed to pass legislation that would have codified abortion access into federal law, and President Joe Biden was deeply criticized by abortion-rights leaders for his perceived reticence to address the issue on its face.\n\n\"After the 2020 election, they went on and on and on about how 'Black women saved the Senate, Black women saved democracy.' Black women were asking you to make sure that we have access to health care,\" Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, an organization that represents those who have had abortions, told The Daily Beast tearfully before the final decision was released. \"Where were you?\"\n\nDiane Derzis, the owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, and the subject of today's new landmark case, spoke to The Daily Beast earlier in the week and said she feared the worst with the court's decision.\n\n\"They still think they can control women. How many women are going to be forced to have children they do not want and can't afford? I think those are the women that we are going to be responsive to at that point,\" Derzis said. \"We have other clinics opening across the country, but what is going to happen in Jackson? What's going to happen to our patients there? This is possibly the worst thing that would have happened to women.\"\n\nOther advocates struck a resilient tone. In a statement, National Women's Law Center President Fatima Goss Graves said the decision was just the beginning of extremist attacks on American's fundamental rights and added, \"They will not win-we will not let them.\" Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood, called the decision \"devastating,\" but added that, \"in stripping away our rights, the Supreme Court and anti-abortion politicians have also unleashed a movement.\"\n\nDemocrats filing into the House chamber appeared visibly shaken up-with several steadfastly bypassing reporters to go vote, though there was still plenty of time before it was gaveled closed.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) walking through simply said, \"Not yet. Not ready yet.\"\n\nYet Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) issued a stark warning to reporters, \"This will not go quietly.\" She vowed to restore abortion rights for her granddaughter and said she anticipated her constituents will protest \"peacefully.\"\n\nOutside, standing barely 50 feet away from the anti-abortion rights revelers, demonstrators with the group Rise Up for Abortion Rights yelled \"Channel your anger!\" as the crowd in front of the court continued to grow.\n\nShortly after their vote to advance the rule for the bipartisan gun deal moving through the chamber Friday, dozens of House Democrats gathered at the bottom of the Capitol steps to march to the Supreme Court. Several members held signs and many of the congresswomen walked with their arms locked, chanting, \"We won't go back. We trust women.\"\n\nAs they approached the court, protesters on both sides of the issue shouted at members. Anti-abortion protesters shouted a chant heard at many of their recent protests at the court: \"Pro-choice is a lie, babies never choose to die.\"\n\nAs members approached the abortion-rights side, protesters by and large shouted thanks to the Democrats for showing up.\n\nSen. Tina Smith (D-MN), a former Planned Parenthood executive, said she wasn't surprised to see the decision-nonetheless \"it was stunning to see this Supreme Court speak, and realize that Roe is gone.\"\n\n\"Having seen firsthand the capacity of women to make good decisions for themselves about their own health care... to see this come to fulfillment was stunning,\" Smith said. \"You can hear the anger in my voice, the sense of outrage that they think they know better than people whose lives and stories they're never going to know.\"\n\nSmith said the court now consists of \"six Republican activists in black robes\" and called the Dobbs decision \"why we need to look at reforming the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"I strongly push back on the idea this is somehow the fault of Democrats, when Republicans are the ones who have put these radical justices on the court-they are the ones who are accountable and responsible for stripping away this freedom that has been in place.\"\n\nAsked to respond to Sen. Joe Manchin's statement saying he was \"alarmed\" that Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch had testified in confirmation hearings that Roe was settled law, she said, \"I was in the Senate when Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh ascended to the Supreme Court. I never had any question about where they stood on the question of abortion, because the president who put them on the Supreme Court... his intention was to name anti-choice justices to the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"I never had any doubt that these justices were going to take the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade . That's exactly what has happened.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Fall of Roe: You Thought Dobbs Was Bad? They're Coming for Brown v. Board\n\nIn June 2022, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned more than a half-century of Supreme Court precedent. Five justices voted to deny constitutional protection for a woman's right to choose and gutted privacy as a fundamental right. Texas and 13 other states now bar abortions in almost all circumstances. Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina have enacted six-week bans.\n\nWriting for the Supreme Court majority, Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, explicitly compared the death of Roe to the end of state-enforced racial segregation, 68 years before. Back in 1954, in a landmark ruling, Brown v. Board of Education , a unanimous court overruled the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" These days, Brown is under attack from Alito's allies on and off the bench.\n\nIn their new book The Fall of Roe , named for Roe v. Wade , the 1973 ruling that previously safeguarded federal abortion rights, Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer masterfully lay out how the cultural right and pro-life movement refused to take \"no\" for an answer, played the long game, and attained the victory for which they had yearned. Dias and Lerer also capture the somnolence of the left and how \"intersectionality\" came to divide old allies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDias is the New York Times religion reporter. A graduate of Wheaton College, the late Rev. Billy Graham's alma mater, she holds a master's degree in divinity from Princeton Theological seminary. Lerer, a veteran of five presidential campaigns, covers politics for the Times . The two of them got Hillary Clinton to speak for the record.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 acknowledges that her party underestimated its adversaries, but doesn't point the finger at herself.\n\n\"We didn't take it seriously, and we didn't understand the threat,\" Clinton said. \"We could have done more to fight.\"\n\n\"I just think that most of us who support the rights of women and privacy and the right to make these difficult decisions yourself, you know, we just couldn't believe what was happening.\"\n\n\"Our side was complacent and kind of taking it for granted and thinking it would never go away.\"\n\nEven as polls show that abortion rights have widening public acceptance, the mechanics of federalism have left legislatures in red states to act as a counterforce to the more liberal national ethos, a point stressed in The Fall of Roe .\n\n\"Republicans had the state legislatures,\" Dias and Lerer write. \"They had a top-to-bottom network. They had the court. They had the power to change American life.\"\n\nThe Fall of Roe also sheds light on the infrastructure that undergirded opposition to Roe . Libertarian-minded donors didn't particularly care about curbing abortion access and David Koch personally supported abortion rights. That having been said, Freedom Partners, a Koch-driven industry group, donated almost $1 million to anti-abortion efforts, which could be paired on election day with tax cuts and lower regulation.\n\nSaid differently , fetuses weren't the only reasons large checks were being cut to the Federalist Society, or that constitutional originalism had become the civic religion of the right. FDR's legacy has to be gutted. Social security may no longer be so secure.\n\nLeonard Leo , the driving force behind the Federalist Society, receives particular attention.\n\n\"Who's this little fucking midget?\" Donald Trump once said of Leo , a close friend of Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nShort answer: Leo helped get each of Trump's Supreme Court nominees across the finish line. Think of him as the straw that stirs the drink.\n\n\"After Alito was confirmed to the court, Leo connected him with ideologically aligned businessmen, some of whom had cases before the court,\" Dias and Lerer write.\n\nThey add that Leo \"spent time with Thomas at... a private lakeside resort owned by a major Republican donor, Harlan Crow. Their visits were memorialized in a painting, hanging inside the lodge.\"\n\nThanks to ProPublica 's Pulitzer-winning reporting , the painting is now well known. The group is shown thoughtfully smoking cigars.\n\nLeo's connections also helped found a nonprofit, the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), \"on the same hallway in a downtown office building as the Federalist Society.\"\n\nWhich all brings us back to Brown v. Board of Education and where the right goes next.\n\nIn Justice on Trial , an examination of Brett Kavanaugh's elevation to the Supreme Court, conservative talking heads Carrie Severino, of JCN, and Mollie Hemingway, of the Federalist, trashed Brown .\n\nAccording to Severino and Hemingway, social science wrongly played a role in the court's calculus. They declared that such decisions \"may have been correct in their result but were decided on the basis of sociological studies rather than legal principles.\"\n\nNotice the word \"may.\"\n\nFast forward to May 2024, when Thomas-who joined Alito's opinion in Dobbs- turned his fire on Brown .\n\n\"Such extravagant uses of judicial power are at odds with the history and tradition of the equity power and the Framers' design,\" he wrote in a concurrence, sustaining a South Carolina congressional map in the face of voting rights challenge.\n\nAs another election looms, abortion and contraception have emerged as campaign issues, to the horror of Trump. On the stump, the presumptive Republican nominee has vacillated over possible restrictions on contraception. Then again, Stormy Daniels testified that Trump did not wear a condom during an encounter Trump still denies, notwithstanding 34 guilty verdicts in the case arising.\n\nAs for meting out punishment to women who have abortions, Trump would leave that to the states.\n\n\"The states are going to make that decision,\" he told Time . \"The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me.\"\n\nHe also declined to say \"no\" to states monitoring women, to identify those who terminate pregnancies. Think The Handmaid's Tale .\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, Dobbs cost the Republicans their \"red wave.\" In 2024, it may lead to another Trump loss and Democrats retaking the House. Right now, things are that close.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Overturning 'Roe' Is Just the Latest Attack on LGBTQ People\n\nWhen the draft decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health was leaked, people immediately began asking whether the Supreme Court was coming for LGBTQ rights next . It's a fair question.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has released its final decision , we know that it maintains the justification from Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion that the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision must be overturned because it relied on rights that are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nThat reasoning could be used to attack other fundamental rights which rely on the principles that supported the right to abortion-including the right to privacy, the right to access and use contraception, the right to engage in same-sex sexual conduct, the right to be free from sterilization by the government, and even the right to enter an interracial or same-sex marriage. The opinion's apparent disregard for the concept of stare decisi s-the principle that obligates courts to follow precedent from prior cases when ruling on a similar case-bolsters fears that the Court could start rolling back additional rights.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn fact, in a separate concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas specifically calls for future cases to \"reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell [,]\" the decisions protecting birth control access, invalidating anti-sodomy laws, and finding a right to marriage equality.\n\nBut the idea that LGBTQ rights are next is not correct, because the assault on LGBTQ rights is already here. This is evidenced not only in the record number of anti-LGBTQ bills in state legislatures we saw this session , but because abortion rights are LGBTQ rights.\n\nBoth LBQ women and nonbinary and transgender individuals need access to reproductive health care services, including abortion. A 2021 report from the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School found that cisgender LBQ women have abortions at slightly higher rates than heterosexual cisgender women: 23 percent of cisgender LBQ women ages 18-49 have had an abortion, compared to 17 percent of heterosexual cisgender women in that age range. While there are no comprehensive studies on termination rates among transgender and gender non-conforming individuals (TGNC), we know that these populations also have abortions and will have their rights curtailed by the court's decision.\n\nLosing the right to access a safe, legal abortion will have the greatest impact on already marginalized populations, such as LGBTQ people who already face significant barriers and discrimination in accessing health care . The Williams Institute estimates that one in six LBQ women report not having health insurance and LBQ women are less likely to have gotten a recommended Pap test or mammogram, compared to heterosexual women.\n\nTGNC individuals encounter unique difficulties when trying to access reproductive health care, including lack of trans-competent providers, exclusion from \"women's\" health clinics and other provider discrimination, and lack of access to health care in general. Research shows that TGNC people assigned female at birth are less likely to obtain regular Pap tests and have difficulty accessing contraception.\n\nSuch disparities are particularly concerning given the statistics on unintended and teen pregnancies. Nearly half of LBQ women who have been pregnant were pregnant as teens, and sexually active bisexual girls have been shown to have 1.72 times greater odds of getting pregnant than their heterosexual cisgender peers. Transgender people assigned as female at birth also report experiencing unplanned pregnancies.\n\nThe LGBTQ community will be harmed by the rollback of Roe , and it won't be by coincidence.\n\nRestrictive abortion laws are part of a coordinated effort to curtail bodily autonomy and enshrine a narrow and oppressive view of sex, gender roles, and family into law-both by impeding reproductive rights and criminalizing LGBTQ health care.\n\nIt is crucial that we recognize this when we speak about whose rights are being eviscerated by the Dobbs decision. And it is imperative that reproductive rights and LGBTQ advocates work together to restore and protect these rights against further attacks on liberty and equality.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "With 'Roe v. Wade' Gone, Men Will Have a Lot Less Sex\n\nRoe v. Wade would have turned 50 years old this week. Its legacy was always bound to be complicated-while it provided some theoretical baseline protections to abortion access , the reality was that after decades of judicial and legislative activism, some American women were a lot more free than others.\n\nStill, as long as Roe survived, reproductive justice in America was a half-completed sandcastle built on a house of cards. Without it, it's just a pile of dirt in a country for old men.\n\nI have a 1-year-old daughter, and this year, I will turn 40. When all is said and done and my reproductive system decides it's time to turn off the lights and hang a sign on the darkened front door thanking its loyal customers all for the business over the years, I will have lived in a country that legally treated any pregnancy of mine as something that should be subject to the superstitions of old men for less than a decade. My daughter's life as a human-minus, officially, will be just about to begin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd so, in that spirit, I don't want to spend the golden anniversary of Roe looking back. Let's look ahead to the lives that have yet to be lived in this new reality. How will the next 50 years without Roe play out?\n\nDemonstrators at a pro-choice march in 1989.\n\nI don't believe that reproductive justice advocates will ever stop fighting for abortion care and access, nor will Americans-70 percent-plus of whom believe that what happens between a woman's legs is not the government's business-stand for it. In the months since the Dobbs decision, we've seen how voters in states nobody would expect-like Kansas, for example-have codified or clarified abortion access for their citizens.\n\nDobbs has also already backfired against the Republican party politically. Much like how a pregnancy puts a temporary and dramatic stop to a menstrual cycle, Dobbs reduced a much-hyped midterm Red Wave to some light red spotting, and now the House GOP is stuck with George Santos.\n\nBut let's say for the sake of argument that anti-democracy moves by the GOP play out in a way that renders public opinion irrelevant. Let's say that every effort by advocates fails, and in 50 years, we are a country with a nationwide abortion ban, limited access to contraception, and no improvements to the social safety net.\n\nMany of the old men who paved the way for the legal unraveling of our daughters' humanity will be dead in 50 years-and, honestly, thank goodness, because I fully plan on outliving these clowns. I've got my dancing shoes shined up and ready to tear it up on some graves. However, the creepy fixation on the reproductive organs of girls and young women will live on in the conservatives of the future.\n\nThere will be an epidemic of lonely old men.\n\nFuture old men will have had less sex than men in generations before, if they're having sex at all. Fewer of them will be married. They will have fewer children. Because women will decide, finally, that heterosexual sex just doesn't add enough to their quality of life to be worth the risk it introduces.\n\nIn the wake of the Roe decision, many observers pointed out that abortion bans don't save babies, they kill women. I don't want to make light of that reality, nor do I want to pretend that any woman who doesn't want to give birth should simply abstain from sex. Many women still face cultural and social pressure to partner with a man, and many experience coercive sex within the context of their partnerships. Many women will still choose to have sex with men, because it's fun and they like it. Not every woman has the power to opt out of sex, nor will they want to. But of those who can, many will.\n\nHouse Democrats join an abortion rights protest  in front of the U.S. Supreme Court Building on July 19, 2022 in Washington, DC.\n\nIt sounds hyperbolic, but it's already happening. Young women across the country are already deciding in droves that having sex with men their age is not worth the trouble. This isn't to be taken lightly-a healthy sex life can be an important component to overall mental and emotional health. But when it benefits one party at the expense of the other, can you blame the other party for opting out?\n\nAdding more risk to the equation hardly makes it a more appealing option. Single, partnered, married, in some kind of bonkers FTX Bahamas penthouse orgy-it won't matter. Every act of potentially procreative hetero sex will carry huge potential consequences for any women involved. (For the sake of brevity, when I say \"sex for women,\" I mean \"heterosexual encounter that could cause a pregnancy\" because upwards of 99 percent of potentially procreative sex occurs between \"women\" and \"men.\" Likewise, I use the term \"old men\" to refer to pro-life conservatives, because even though they do use women and young people as props in some photo opportunities, they, too, are mostly old men.)\n\nIf every act of sexual intercourse between a man and woman of reproductive age has a significant chance of producing a pregnancy that the woman would be legally required to carry to term, and if many health-care providers won't even treat many serious pregnancy complications out of fear that they could be accused of performing an abortion and losing their license, that means that every act of procreative sex could lead to serious injury or even death. And that's just the physical consequences.\n\n(For those of you raising a single finger skyward in preparation of sending me a smug email suggesting that men would just pull out or wear condoms, let me preemptively respond:\n\nNo, they won't.)\n\nIn this physical risk environment, abstaining from sex entirely would be a rational decision for many heterosexual women who either don't want children or for whom pregnancy would pose serious health risks. This doesn't mean that the country will be overrun with sad old cat ladies; given the fact that the happiest demographic are women who never married or had children and the least happy demographic are men who never married and did not have children, a world where women don't want to be with men at all is a sad one... for men.\n\nThe conservatives who laid the groundwork for this future could have staved it off by making parenthood, and specifically motherhood, more financially appealing to more people. But they didn't. They could have enacted a nationwide paid family leave program, but they didn't. They could have invested in universal child care. They didn't. They could have built a single-payer universal health-care system. They didn't. They could have made certain colleges free, or helped ease the burden of student loans of people during their prime child-rearing years. They didn't. They could have pushed for more affordable housing. They didn't. They could have extended the child tax credit. They didn't.\n\nInstead, conservatives suggest that women who have children they can't afford (thanks to conditions created by conservatives) or don't want to raise should simply surrender their children for adoption. Anybody who believes that the act of putting a child up for adoption is not agonizing-to-traumatizing for the birth mother has never spoken to a woman who has given a child up for adoption.\n\nArchitects of our anti-choice present seem to truly believe that young women of the future, their autonomy thwarted by a legal landscape hostile to choice, will simply throw up their hands in surrender, run with open arms toward marriage at a young age, start birthing a Bible-reading brood, dutifully attend church and tell their husbands to vote Republican (because who needs the 19th Amendment when you've got a husband!).\n\nIf they die along the way, oh well, God's will. The old men in charge believe reproductive freedom is the only thing standing between our current hellspape and the shining white Christian ethnostate on a hill our founders envisioned when they ratified the constitution drunk off their asses .\n\nThe more conservatives push to reach their wrinkly hands up the skirts of American women, the more they're getting slapped away. This might mean that, eventually, stronger reproductive protections rise from the ashes of Roe . Or it might turn every heterosexual encounter into a potential pregnancy and every potential pregnancy into a potential grave injury, financial disaster, government-enforced trauma, and even death sentence.\n\nFor generations, America's old men have taken active steps to make being a girl or woman of reproductive age as punishing as possible, like the enforcement arm of an old testament god still pissed about that whole snake in the garden thing. I can think of few policy blunders more catastrophic.\n\nErin.Ryan@protonmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "How Roe v. Wade Became a 'Godsend' for the Religious Right\n\nThe 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion as a fundamental right for women wasn't all that controversial at the time.\n\nThe Catholic Church didn't like it, but other major religions were not opposed to women terminating an early pregnancy for economic or social reasons. The Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution in 1971 calling for the legalization of abortion, which it affirmed in 1974 and again in 1976. Ronald Reagan as governor of California had signed the most progressive abortion law in the country in 1967 , signaling broad acceptance of the procedure.\n\nWhen SCOTUS handed down its 7-to-2 decision in Roe v. Wade , evangelicals saw it as \"a Catholic issue\" while maintaining their focus on preserving school segregation and tax breaks for schools defying integration like Bob Jones University, which only began enrolling African Americans in 1971 and banned interracial dating until 2000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs many white Christian leaders grew uncomfortable rallying voters around segregation, prominent conservatives, principally the late Paul Weyrich, founder of The Heritage Foundation and co-founder of the Moral Majority, seized on anti-abortion activism as a morally acceptable way to win recruits for the Right.\n\n\"I describe abortion for the Religious Right as a godsend,\" says Randall Balmer, professor in religion at Dartmouth College, \"because it allowed them to distract from the real origins of their activism, which was the defense of racial segregation.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 1979, a full six years after Roe, that Weyrich, a devout Catholic, made common cause with Southern Baptist pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell, Sr, establishing the Moral Majority as a launch pad for what became the pro-life movement. \"Paul Weyrich, he's the evil genius,\" says Balmer. Falwell did not preach against abortion until a sermon in February of 1978 when Jimmy Carter was in the White House on the strength of the evangelical vote , and Republicans wanted that vote and the White House back in GOP hands.\n\nWeyrich was candid about what mobilized the evangelicals, just how candid Balmer found out when he attended a closed-door conference in November 1990 with all the major religious right figures-a group of men including Richard Land, Ralph Reed and Richard Viguerie along with Weyrich who in the course of their strategizing stated that abortion had nothing to do with the genesis of their movement.\n\nBy then, it was accepted wisdom that Roe had sparked a religious and moral backlash to abortion. \"I call all this one of the most durable myths in American history,\" says Balmer. \"It's the fiction that the religious right galvanized in a political movement in response to Roe v. Wade.\"\n\nBalmer followed up with Weyrich, who said he had been trying various issues since 1964 and the candidacy of Barry Goldwater to find an issue that would energize evangelical voters. He tried abortion, pornography, school prayer, opposition to women's rights. Nothing worked until the IRS started snooping around schools, and the specter of schools losing their tax-exempt status for refusing to integrate was the issue that stuck.\n\n\"The burden of my argument is to say the Religious Right movement had its roots in the defense of racial segregation,\" said Balmer, the author of Bad Faith: Roe and the Rise of the Religious Right .\n\nThe examples of early evangelical indifference to Roe abound. Pastor W.A. Criswell, one of the most famous fundamentalists of the 20th century and a two-term president of the Southern Baptist Convention, applauded the passage of Roe from his perch as senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas. \"I have always felt it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person, and it has always therefore seemed to me that what is best for the mother and the future should be allowed.\"\n\nOnly after Roe was politicized did evangelical leaders adopt the Catholic position that life begins at conception. Until then, as Criswell articulated, many believed that personhood began at birth. Even James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family who became an implacable foe of abortion, said in 1973 that the Bible is silent on the matter and that \"a developing embryo or fetus is not regarded as a full human being.\"\n\nCarter had run for president as a born-again Christian, an identity that in the 1970s was not widely adopted outside of the South. \"Carter tried very hard as governor and president to limit abortion, but he felt constrained by the Roe decision,\" says Balmer. By the fall of 1980, 41 percent of evangelicals supported a legal ban on abortion. A majority had not yet formed. When Reagan addressed thousands of exuberant evangelicals in Dallas that August, he talked about creationism and castigated the IRS for going after schools. He did not mention abortion. The next month, his campaign issued a clarion call to church groups about the \"unconstitutional regulatory vendetta launched by Jimmy Carter's Internal Revenue Service against independent schools.\"\n\nActually, Bob Jones University lost its tax exempt status on Jan. 19, 1976, when Gerald Ford was president, though Carter got blamed for it. The case went to the Supreme Court and when the Reagan administration announced it would defend Bob Jones, there was a backlash that crossed party lines and the administration abandoned its defense. The 1983 ruling was 8 to 1 in favor of the government's right to deny tax exempt status to the university because of its racially discriminatory policies. Reagan would later elevate the sole dissenter, William Rehnquist, to Chief Justice.\n\nDriven more by politics than moral concerns, the two political parties moved toward their current stand-off on abortion. In 1976, the GOP platform was ambivalent, calling abortion \"undoubtedly a moral and personal issue\" which party members disagreed on. Four years later, seeking to regain the White House, the GOP called for a constitutional amendment protecting \"the right to life for unborn children.\" By 1992, the GOP demanded its standard-bearer appoint judges who oppose abortion, a call that Donald Trump heeded, and here we are.\n\nA half century after Roe, with the rights it conferred about to be overturned or severely restricted, we can only guess at what will unfold. \"Mayhem,\" says Balmer. \"The backlash will be huge, but whether it will be enough to energize the Democrats, we don't know.\" Republicans have had a long run exploiting an issue that is deeply personal.\n\nSoon it will be the Democrats' turn to see if they can find political benefit in the actions of a Court far more out of touch with public sentiment than the one that handed down Roe.\n\neleanor.clift@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "John Oliver Rages Against Dems' Embarrassing Roe v. Wade Response\n\nThis week saw the highly politicized Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade , a landmark 1973 ruling protecting a woman's right to an abortion (in other words, granting women bodily autonomy and keeping the government out of their uteruses).\n\nThe move was met with widespread condemnation, especially given how right-wing organizations have launched an ugly decades-long campaign against a woman's right to choose (including bribing Jane Roe, aka Norma McCorvey, to speak out against the decision) , and four of the five conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to strike down Roe -Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett-stating during their Senate confirmation hearings that it was settled law. The move will result in 22 states banning abortion, along with 13 states that immediately banned it due to trigger laws.\n\n\"It's absolutely horrifying,\" exclaimed John Oliver on Sunday evening's edition of Last Week Tonight , before taking aim at some of the \"gleeful responses\" from Republicans in the wake of the decision, including Mike Pence, who said that \"life won.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Which is pretty tough to take given that especially for some, especially disabled people and other vulnerable groups, forced pregnancy could be a death sentence,\" offered Oliver. \"And make no mistake: this decision is sweeping. It says that states could limit abortion at all stages of development-phrasing that could mean from the moment of conception onward with no exceptions.\"\n\nIf that weren't enough, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion, wrote that \"in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell \"-landmark decisions protecting the ability to buy and use contraceptives, engage in anal or oral sex, and allow same-sex couples to marry.\n\n\"Yeah. Clarence Thomas wants to uphold the sanctity of marriage-because, as we all know, marriage is between one man credibly accused of sexual harassment and one woman who wanted to overthrow a presidential election. You know, the way God intended,\" joked Oliver.\n\nThe HBO host then aimed his ire at Democrats, who had many weeks to prepare a vigorous response to the overturning of Roe , given the prior leak of SCOTUS' draft opinion .\n\n\"It has been dispiriting to see so many Democrats this week utterly fail to meet the moment-a moment, by the way, they had nearly two months to plan for,\" seethed Oliver. \"Nancy Pelosi read a poem, one Rep. [Andy Levin, D-MI] tweeted a picture of himself doing yoga, and so many Democrats sent out requests for money, really fulfilling that old Democratic adage: when they go low, we ask you for 15 dollars .\" (House Democrats also chose to sing \"God Bless America\" on the Capitol steps , for some reason.)\n\nHe continued: \"And I am not saying that all I want from leaders is shows of anger, but it has been depressing to see so many of them treat the end of Roe v. Wade with the solemnity of a funeral instead of the urgency of a fucking cardiac arrest. And they stand in stark contrast to the groups on the ground who have displayed that urgency for years now. They fought relentlessly as abortion rights have been chipped away all over the country, and they have worked tirelessly to find ways around each restriction and provide health care services for those that have been denied them, even when it was very hard.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Roe Is Radical. The Conservative Justices Aiming to Overturn It Are Not.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nEven before the Supreme Court's oral arguments on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization kicked off this week, prominent media voices were preemptively undermining a future decision by declaring this Supreme Court to be \" radical .\"\n\nBut let's examine the charge of radicalism on its merits.\n\nFirst, it's important to reiterate that overturning Roe -which seems increasingly likely ( you heard it here first )-would not ban abortion , but would, instead, send the issue back to states to decide via the democratic process. Despite what you might have read , this is hardly a radical idea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, it seems to me that a more radical idea would be nine men in robes unilaterally imposing a top-down law, under the guise of a purely fictional \"right to privacy.\" This is to say that Roe was-and remains-radical.\n\nAs I noted in June , anyone alive in 1868 would have been stunned to learn the 14th Amendment implicitly legalized abortion, which became criminalized (except in instances where the life of the mother was at stake) around 1880. For over a hundred years, the amendment did nothing to legalize abortion.\n\nEven some prominent liberals who supported abortion rights conceded Roe is a flawed ruling. Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously agreed that the precedent was reasoned badly. (The subsequent Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992 similarly reverse-engineered a new rationale not found in the Constitution to justify abortions.)\n\nPutting the substance of this radical ruling aside, the practical effect of Roe has been to radicalize our politics. Had the legislative process not been prematurely aborted by the Supreme Court in 1973, it's possible that we might have arrived at some sort of consensus regarding abortion rights by now. But Roe short-circuited that process. It also nationalized and heightened the stakes of presidential elections ( not to mention Supreme Court hearings ). As a result, American politics has become more nasty and apocalyptic. Every election is the most important in history.\n\nThis is not just pablum politicians spout around election time. The stakes are high, and this is a reality that covers a multitude of sins. For example, it's entirely possible-maybe even likely-that Donald Trump would not have been elected president without the stakes raised by Roe . This is because Mitch McConnell held the seat open, guaranteeing that the winner of the 2016 presidential election would get at least one SCOTUS pick. In so doing, McConnell made it dramatically easier for social conservatives (who, for decades, had been told Supreme Court nominations were the alpha and omega) to hold their nose and rationalize pulling the lever for Trump.\n\nA Supreme Court reversal of Roe this coming summer would only reinforce the sagaciousness of this devil's bargain (and, in so doing, potentially help lay the runway for a potential Trump 2024 takeoff). But don't let that stop you from supporting it. Remember, Roe arguably gave us Trump to begin with.\n\nOf course, the court could find some way to uphold the Mississippi law without outrightly or immediately reversing the Roe - Casey framework. This more moderate decision would still be called \"radical.\" In fact, earlier this week, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referred to \" Mississippi's radical abortion ban ...\"\n\nBut is 15 weeks a radical demarcation? As Chief Justice John Roberts noted during Wednesday's oral argument, the 15-week ban is \"not a dramatic departure from viability [the point at which a baby could survive outside the womb]. It is the standard that the vast majority of other countries have.\" He went on to note that \"When you get to the viability standard, [America currently shares] that standard with the People's Republic of China and North Korea.\"\n\n(It's impossible to dismiss this point, but it is fair to quibble with it. According to PolitiFact , \"Abortion laws are subject to interpretation,\" but \"About 13 European nations have time limits that are clearly shorter than Mississippi's 15 weeks.\" Regardless, Chief Justice Roberts' point is valid: The Mississippi law is more mainstream in the context of secular Europe.)\n\nIt is the act of abortion after 15 weeks that strikes me as radical. According to the Mayo Clinic , \"Fifteen weeks into your pregnancy, or 13 weeks after conception, your baby is growing rapidly. Bone development continues and will soon become visible on ultrasound images. Your baby's scalp hair pattern also is forming.\" Whether you want to call it infanticide or simply \"terminating a pregnancy,\" the idea of eliminating life via invasive surgery seems more extreme than the alternative (putting that child up for adoption).\n\nI concede that overturning Roe could be considered \"radical\" in the sense that it would be a big change . And, yes, the more conservative (in the sense of being \"adverse to change\") decision would be to simply defer to past precedent. But do we want to stick with bad policies that were wrongly decided based on... tradition? Do we want to stick with bad policies that were wrongly decided because some people have come to rely on them?\n\nThe good news is, there is precedent for breaking precedent. I am persuaded by what Justice Samuel Alito said on Wednesday : \"There was a lot of reliance on Plessy [ v. Ferguson ]. The South built up a whole society based on the idea of white supremacy. So there was a lot of reliance. It was improper reliance. It was reliance on an egregiously wrong understanding of what equal protection means.\"\n\nAlito's comparison of a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the \"separate but equal\" doctrine to Roe is sure to drive progressives crazy, but anti-abortion activists have long looked to abolitionist heroes like William Wilberforce-the British politician who led the movement to abolish the slave trade-for inspiration while fighting to establish the rights of the exploited and the vulnerable.\n\nSo maybe we are radicals, after all?\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

Jackson Women's Health. The court's removal of the right to safe, legal abortions has led to total abortion bans in 12 states. Meanwhile, the push to ensure access to abortion has spurred new legal challenges and greater reliance on the abortion pill mifepristone, as medication abortions account for more than half of all U.S. abortions. We get an update from Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation, whose most recent piece looks at how cities and states are acting to limit the damage from Dobbs. \"There are an untold number of people staying pregnant against their will, despite the best efforts of activists,\" she says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This Sunday, January 22nd, would have marked the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. But just over six months ago, the court upended five decades of legal precedent when it struck down Roe v. Wade in the case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health . The court's removal of the right to safe, legal abortions has led to total abortion bans in 12 states, with low-income and Black and Latinx and Indigenous people among the most impacted.\n\nMeanwhile, the push to ensure access to abortion has spurred new legal challenges and greater reliance on medical - on the medical pill, the abortion pill mifepristone, as medication abortions account for more than half of all U.S. abortions today. Starting today, New York City plans to offer free abortion pills at four sexual health clinics.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation . Her most recent piece is headlined \"Cities and States Are Acting Fast to Blunt the Impact of Dobbs .\" She's just back from New Mexico, where activists are working to expand abortion access as people seek help there from neighboring states, like Texas, where abortion bans are in place.\n\nAmy Littlefield, welcome back to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us. Why don't you give us a lay of the land of abortion access around this country today?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : It's so great to be back with you, Amy and Juan, on this somber and also, I would say, hopeful anniversary - or, what would have been the anniversary of Roe v. Wade .\n\nSo, I want to talk about the literal map of abortion access in this country right now. As you mentioned, 12 states ban abortion entirely in this moment, with some limited exceptions depending on how - each state law is different in terms of how dead or how sick the pregnant person has to be before there can be an intervention to save their life and terminate the pregnancy. Most of the states that have these bans do not make exceptions for rape or incest. And what's really important, Amy, is, when you look at the map, there's Idaho and South Dakota, and then there's 10 states with these total bans that are all in a row in a deep red brick wall across the South. So, if you start in El Paso, Texas, and move to the east, to the eastern edge of Alabama, we're talking about a solid block of 10 states. Moving up north to Missouri and to West Virginia in the east, we're talking about states all in a row, multistates deep, more than 1,300 miles of states pushed together, where legal abortion is effectively gone.\n\nAnd I want to tell you a number that I can't stop thinking about since I found it, which is 58,000. Amy, that's the number of abortions that happened in Texas in 2020. Fifty-eight thousand, OK? That's like a decent-sized city - right? - that happens to be composed entirely of people of childbearing age, most of whom are women and also trans and gender-nonconforming people, who are pregnant and don't want to be. And I ask you to imagine, in this landscape, this deep brick wall of abortion bans, where those 58,000 people are going to go. Right? What happens to them? And we know, you know, from speaking to activists in states like New Mexico, some of them are making it out. Some of them are making these arduous journeys in cars filled with sleeping bags and coolers. They're driving across state lines. They're boarding planes as part of airlifts coordinated by grassroots activists. But I think the emerging picture is that that is the exception and not the rule, and there are an untold number of people staying pregnant against their will, despite the best efforts of activists to help them get access to abortion pills even in states where abortion is banned or to get outside of the state to seek legal abortion elsewhere.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Amy, there have been some states that have enacted laws that strengthen abortion rights or rejected ballot initiatives that would restrict the procedure. Could you talk about some of those states and what they are doing, in effect, to assist those in the abortion ban states?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Absolutely, Juan, and you're so right. I mean, there is this emerging picture of states, on the one hand, going as far as they can to ban abortion, and then, on the other hand, this really historic momentum building behind pro-abortion rights policies that once would have felt unheard of in this country. And that's happening not just in blue states like California and New York, Washington, Oregon and Illinois; it's also happening in cities and counties within these deep red states.\n\nSo, for example, Nashville, Tennessee, the City Council there has passed legislation deprioritizing enforcement of abortion-related crimes, because abortion is illegal in Tennessee. So, the Nashville city councilors said, \"Well, what can we do?\" You know, they have also allocated half a million dollars to Planned Parenthood to fund reproductive healthcare.\n\nSo we're seeing cities and counties trying to step up. Atlanta is another one that's directed public funding, as well as Seattle - right? - a city that you might have expected that from. New Orleans, cities in - Denton, Texas, these are places that are passing proactive measures to blunt the impact of criminal abortion laws and also to try to shore up reproductive healthcare access wherever they can.\n\nIn the first three months after the Dobbs decision came down reversing Roe v. Wade , we saw 17 states and at least 24 municipalities moving to expand or protect abortion access. That's according to the National Institute for Reproductive Health. So, that's really historic, and it speaks to a huge surge in momentum and, I think, a lot of Democratic politicians at the local and county and state level understanding that there's tremendous power in local government. Now, the anti-abortion movement was very savvy about realizing that before, but I think we're seeing a long-overdue recognition of the power of local government among progressives right now.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk, as well, about the actions of the federal government, of the Biden administration, and the announcement earlier this month of the Food and Drug Administration?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Right. So, what happened earlier this month is that the Food and Drug Administration announced an easing of restrictions on mifepristone, the abortion pill, which is one of the medications taken to induce a medication abortion. And what it will allow is for the abortion pill to be sold in retail pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens, if someone has a prescription. This is a game changer for people who live in states where abortion is legal, who might be able to go to a CVS or Walgreens. This is if these pharmacies go through the certification process the FDA has set up. Then you can go to a CVS or a Walgreens in a state like Massachusetts, where I am, or New York and get your prescription for the abortion pill filled there, which is a huge shift. I mean, before, because of the pandemic, the Biden administration had made the abortion pill available through the mail, from mail-order pharmacies. Before that, you had to go in person to a clinic in order to get it. So, this is a game changer, but one that affects people in states where abortion is already legal. The same thing with Mayor Eric Adams' decision and the public health clinics that are going to be offering the abortion pill in New York City for free - I mean, that's a huge, hugely significant decision.\n\nI think each of these decisions moves the Overton window - right? - takes a step towards destigmatizing abortion and could lead to people in states where abortion is banned, you know, in Tennessee and Arkansas, demanding not just a reimplementation of the protections in Roe v. Wade , but free abortion pills in the public health clinic. If it's happening in New York City, I think that shifts the Overton window for everyone else.\n\nAnd I want to say - you know, not to give Eric Adams too much credit here. I want to just say these movements, these victories belong to the movements that are advocating for them, and not to the politicians, because we know Democrats have spent a long time treading water when it comes to expanding abortion access, and I think they're moving now because of this crisis and because of the enormous amount of momentum behind the deeply popular right to an abortion -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Amy -\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : - and restoring it and expanding it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It may have explained why the House division between Democrats and Republicans is so close, that it wasn't a red wave, as many had predicted, because of people's concern about reproductive rights access. But what about, for example, Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, who ran on a very pro-choice stand against Lee Zeldin, fiercely anti-choice, and yet she appoints to the - she nominates to the highest court Hector LaSalle. Many progressives are condemning this move because he is anti-choice, not to mention anti-labor.\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Absolutely, Amy. And I have to say, the sound and the fury that are merging the enormous amount of resistance around LaSalle's nomination shows what happens when two of the most enormously powerful and surging underpinnings of the Democratic Party's power get together - right? - labor unions, on the one hand, opposing LaSalle's stance against unions in rulings against unions, and then abortion rights, right? I mean, I wish we saw more collaboration - and I think we will - between those two extremely powerful movements.\n\nBut the reason why LaSalle is a deep concern for supporters of abortion rights, and the other day more than a hundred experts and advocates and organizations that support abortion rights signed on to a letter opposing his nomination, is because of a ruling in favor of crisis pregnancy centers. These are anti-abortion centers that often pose as abortion clinics, that try to look like medical clinics. And when Attorney General Eric Schneiderman tried to investigate them several years ago, he was stymied by a ruling that LaSalle had signed on to. And so, that's of tremendous concern, especially because, you know, these policies, like the one in New York City to issue free abortion pills in public health centers, the efforts by the New York state Legislature to shore up abortion access, they don't mean anything if the courts are against those policies. And if the highest court in the land is going to come down and reverse those policies or stymie those policies because of an anti-abortion stance, then, you know, these policies, even in a state like New York that's considered safe, are dead in the water. And so this is hugely consequential.\n\nAnd I think it's clear that Kathy Hochul didn't read the writing on the wall, right? I mean, Democrats owe the fact that they averted a total disaster in the midterms to the reversal of Roe v. Wade and the enormous amount of work and grassroots organizing that went into pushing back against that overturn and trying to restore abortion rights. I mean, if you don't believe me, consider the fact that there were six states where abortion was directly on the ballot in the midterms, OK, starting with Kansas in August, of course, which we talked about on the show. And even in red states like Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, the abortion rights position won in every single one of those ballot measures. And so, what that says is that the Democratic base is fired up on this issue. It sees a connection between abortion and other economic issues. And some Democrats are recognizing that. And it would seem some Democrats, like Kathy Hochul, are not understanding precisely what their constituents want.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Amy, we just have a few seconds left, but I wanted to ask you - you mentioned you had been to New Mexico recently and the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Could you talk about what you saw on the ground there?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Yeah. So, I visited the headquarters of the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, which is an abortion fund that provides practical support. They help with the logistics of people traveling to New Mexico. And again, remember, New Mexico is right to the west bordering Texas, that state where there were 58,000 abortions in 2020, OK? And this is a state that had about a tenth of that in terms of their 2020 numbers for abortion.\n\nSo, this is a grassroots organization. Every week they reserve 10 spots on an airplane to bring patients from Texas and airlift them to New Mexico for an abortion. And they have set up - their offices have begun what looks like sort of a field hospital in this new borderland of abortion access. They've got cots for people to rest on. They've got heating pads that were stitched by volunteers; cookies baked by volunteers; freezers full of frozen dinners; maxi pads; toys for kids. I mean, it's this real - it's this way station for people who are making a long journey from out of state, mostly from Texas, to come to New Mexico, which has become this haven destination for abortion. You're seeing clinics following the flow of patients moving to New Mexico from states where abortion is banned.\n\nBut the most chilling thing that stuck with me from this visit, Juan, is that they told me that they don't always - they're not always able to fill those 10 spots on the airplanes that they fly each week. Sometimes they have seven people coming. Sometimes they have fewer. And what I think that speaks to is an enormous amount of confusion and an enormous amount of sort of lack of information for people who need an abortion and might not know where to go. And we don't know how many of those patients are self-managing an abortion with the help of grassroots organizations or, you know, some underground networks. We don't know how many of those people are just staying pregnant against their will. And that really is the human rights crisis that is unfolding in real time right in front of us on this Roe v. Wade anniversary.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amy Littlefield, we want to thank you so much for being with us, abortion access correspondent at The Nation . We'll link to your latest piece , \"Cities and States Are Acting Fast to Blunt the Impact of Dobbs .\"\n\nNext up, as Senator Bernie Sanders gives a national address on the state of America's working class, we'll look at what he addressed last night: the growing problem of medical debt and the movement to stop hospitals from suing patients, having their wages garnished, putting liens on the homes of people facing medical bills they cannot afford.

Wade decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion for half a century. The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is devastating in its own right, but also foreshadows how this extremist rightwing majority on the Supreme Court could destroy more than a century of progress. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the heavily criticized majority opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Four of these five were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, three by President Trump and one, Alito, appointed by President George W. Bush.\n\nAs soon as the Dobbs opinion was published on Friday, June 24th, many states rushed to implement \"trigger laws\" passed in advance of Roe's overturning, allowing an immediate abortion ban. The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health advocacy organization, reports that 26 states are now definitely or likely going to ban abortions.\n\n\"Forty percent of women of childbearing age or more will be affected,\" Kathryn Kolbert said on the Democracy Now! news hour in the wake of the decision. Kolbert co-founded the Center for Reproductive Rights and argued the landmark Supreme Court case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. The Dobbs decision also overturns Casey, which solidified the precedent set by Roe. \"We're talking about hundreds of thousands of women who will be seeking abortions for their unintended pregnancies having to travel hundreds and hundreds of miles to safe states. This is no way to provide healthcare. This is no way to live in a democracy.\"\n\nOn the day of the Dobbs ruling, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a memorandum describing his timeline for implementing the state's total abortion ban, with its narrow exception for the protection of the life of the pregnant person and no exception for rape or incest. \"Some prosecutors may choose to immediately pursue criminal prosecutions... Abortion providers could be criminally liable for providing abortions starting today,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU immediately sued, winning a temporary restraining order  blocking Texas from enforcing its century-old abortion ban. Abortions resumed at several clinics across Texas, but only up to the sixth week of pregnancy - before many people even know they are pregnant.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned,\" Kamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, said on Democracy Now! \"Our abortion fund specifically is on the radar of anti-abortion extremists and our conservative elected officials. We have received cease-and-desist letters about our work, tweets saying that they will target us for felony penalties for continuing our work.\"\n\nKamyon Conner's work has suddenly become more dangerous, and much more needed.\n\n\"Our abortion fund, the TEA Fund, helps people pay for their abortions in Texas, which costs anywhere from $500 or more...because there's no insurance coverage of abortion in our state,\" Kamyon explained. \"Other abortion funds also do practical or logistical support, basically helping someone travel to wherever they need to go within the state, previously, or outside of the state, as well. That includes bus passes, plane tickets, meal vouchers, Ubers from your airport to where you're staying, and hotel stays.\" All these activities could well be prosecutable in Texas and other ant-choice states, if deemed to be \"aiding and abetting\" abortions.\n\nThe United States is rapidly becoming a patchwork of states with fifty different sets of laws either banning, restricting, or, in sixteen cases, guaranteeing access to an abortion. This dystopian system has been forced on this country's 330 million people by five unelected Republican Supreme Court justices, all of whom have lifetime appointments.\n\nSupreme Court decisions are not open to judicial review, but they can be countered by a force more powerful: the people. A strong majority of all Americans support access to safe, legal abortion. A vocal, well-organized and well-funded minority has worked for decades to overturn Roe. And they won't be satisfied with just this victory.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in Dobbs arguing the court should also overturn precedents that legalized same-sex marriage, access to contraception, and intimate same-sex relationships. Just in the last couple of weeks, the court has gutted gun control laws and further whittled away at the separation of church and state, and allowed racist gerrymandering to stand.\n\nOn Thursday, President Biden said he would support a filibuster carve-out to pass a law codifying Roe v. Wade. With the current, slim majority in the Senate, Democrats, independents and pro-choice Republicans could do this today. And so much more hinges on the 2022 midterm elections. The majority who support the gains of progressive movements over the past century have four months to organize,  to forcefully demonstrate their power at the polls.\n\nAs goes Roe, so goes the nation.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Wade. Chief Justice John Roberts supported upholding the Mississippi law but not overturning Roe. Nine states have already banned abortion since Friday, and 17 more states are expected to do so soon. We speak with Michele Goodwin, chancellor's professor at University of California, Irvine School of Law, whose new piece for The New York Times is headlined \"No, Justice Alito, Reproductive Justice Is in the Constitution.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nToday we spend the hour on the Supreme Court's long-anticipated ruling Friday that overturned Roe v. Wade , the landmark decision that established the constitutional right to abortion some 50 years ago. The conservative court ruled 6 to 3 Friday to uphold a Republican-backed Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, while voting 5 to 4 to overturn Roe completely. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts supported upholding the Mississippi law but not overturning Roe. Nine states have already banned abortion since Friday; 17 more states are promising to do so soon.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, quote, \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\"\n\nIn their dissent, the court's three liberal justices wrote, quote, \"With sorrow-for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection-we dissent.\"\n\nConservative Justice Clarence Thomas sided with the majority but argued in a concurring opinion that other key landmark rulings establishing gay rights, the right to contraception, as well, should also be overturned.\n\nProtests broke out nationwide in response to the ruling and continued over the weekend as thousands marched nationwide, with some facing arrest and police brutality in Los Angeles and South Carolina.\n\nPROTESTER : This Supreme Court thinks that they can put a law on this land that the majority of this country does not support, that will strip away the basic human rights of over half of the people living here! I'm mad!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In states with abortion bans already in place, many clinics immediately stopped offering abortions Friday, saying it was the best way to protect staff and patients because of the legal uncertainty, with providers canceling appointments, asking patients to seek help elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, reproductive rights activists are mobilizing to support patients with travel, funds and more.\n\nThis is Renee Bracey Sherman, executive director of We Testify, speaking at a protest this weekend.\n\nRENEE BRACEY SHERMAN : It's also going to be critical that you show up in four, five, six, seven, eight, nine months, and somebody is arrested for their stillbirth or their miscarriage or self-managing their abortions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In our next segment, we'll be going to Missouri, which became the first state to enact its trigger law after Friday's ruling. This is Congressmember Cori Bush, a Democrat of Missouri, responding to the Supreme Court's ruling Friday.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Forty-nine years - I'm sorry - 49 years, and they stripped it away. ... Thirty-six million people will be affected, and it's \"Oh, well.\" Thirty-six million people, it's \"Oh, well.\" Thirty-six million people, and this is a far-right, extremist Supreme Court that's making this decision that affects other people, that affects lives, when Black women were - when we know that Black women, the leading cause of death before 1973 was the sepsis, was the sepsis that went along with these unsafe abortions. And to say, \"Hey, we're good if we're going back there. We're gonna send you back there,\" to know that people are already hurting, that people need services - this is healthcare. It's like mental health. It's like going to get your - get the services for heart disease, get services for a toothache. It is healthcare.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In the past, Congressmember Bush has shared that she was raped and got an abortion as a teenager.\n\nPresident Biden denounced Friday's ruling and vowed to protect access to abortion pills and contraception. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and 25 other senators wrote a letter to Biden calling on him to open federal enclaves in red states to health clinics that provide abortion. This is Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press .\n\nREP . ALEXANDRIA OCASIO - CORTEZ : What I believe that the president and the Democratic Party needs to come to terms with is that this is not just a crisis of Roe , this is a crisis of our democracy. The Supreme Court has dramatically overreached its authority.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by two guests. In Philadelphia, Kathryn \"Kitty\" Kolbert is with us, co-founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights. She argued the landmark case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey before the Supreme Court in 1992, which upheld Roe . She's the co-author of the book Controlling Women: What We Must Do Now to Save Reproductive Freedom .\n\nAlso with us is Michele Goodwin, chancellor's professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, host of the Ms. magazine podcast On the Issues with Michele Goodwin and author of Policing The Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood . She just has a piece out in The New York Times headlined \"No, Justice Alito, Reproductive Justice Is in the Constitution.\"\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Professor Goodwin, let's begin with you. Can you talk about your response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe after almost 50 years?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, it's good to be back with you, Amy, on this show.\n\nThe decision itself, just as we saw with the leaked draft, has many errors, omissions. It has a selective, if not opportunistic, reading of American history. It does not center - in all of its claimed originalism, in all of its claimed textualism, interestingly enough, it avoids the 13th Amendment. It even avoids the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.\n\nAnd here's what my New York Times piece was about. It was that when Congress abolished, through the ratification of the 13th Amendment, abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, they were not abolishing that just for Black men. They very well understood that involuntary servitude for Black women in the United States meant involuntary sexual assaults, rapes and then the reproduction after that, as Black women were forced to labor not only in the fields, but also labor under the weight, a different kind of shackling of slavery, which was sexual subordination and reproduction.\n\nThis was very well known. The abolitionist in Congress who led the way for the 13th Amendment spoke and wrote about this. Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner was nearly beaten to death in the halls of Congress two days after giving a speech about the raping of Black women. Sojourner Truth spoke to it. I mean, it was clear. The New York Times , there were articles about it. So the very idea that there was no one thinking about involuntary servitude as being consistent with involuntary reproduction is just absurdist. It was written about everywhere. Everyone knew this as being one of the devastating effects of American slavery. And it was abolished with the 13th Amendment. And then, later on, with the 14th Amendment, it was still recognized that Black women were psychologically, physically and reproductively still being harmed in Southern states. Their children were being denied citizenship. Their children were being snatched and taken away from them. And the 14th Amendment was therefore then ratified.\n\nThe piece goes into depth in all of these categories to give an education to the Supreme Court and to our country to remember this, because, otherwise, Black women have been essentially erased from the Constitution. And by erasing Black women from the Constitution, we ultimately erase all women from the Constitution, because the 13th Amendment and 14th Amendment not only freed Black women from these bondages, but it also freed white women from these bondages.\n\nNone of this is given any kind of reading by the originalists and textualists on the Supreme Court, who seem to ignore all of that and have now rendered us to a country where there are free states, where individuals can be free in their bodies, and also those where it is nonfree. And one can't help but understand this as being so consistent with the patterns of slavery and Jim Crow in the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's talk about the trajectory right through to now. People of color are most affected by the lack of healthcare that will be available when abortion is outlawed in state after state. Can you talk about the Duke study, about Black maternal mortality, and how much higher it is than for white people who are pregnant?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, I'm glad that you mentioned that, because what is also alarming in this opinion, and also in the draft opinion, is how it gives no regard to facts, concurrent facts. The United States ranks 55th in the world in terms of maternal mortality. It is not in league with Germany, France, its peer nations. Instead, it's in peer company with nations that still publicly lash and stone women.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court's own record showed that women were 14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. Once we flash what this looks like in terms of race, then we really get a sense of the horror that's behind all of this, and again with the Supreme Court deciding that it would pay no attention to it. So, in Mississippi, we're looking at 118 times - Black women more likely to die 118 times by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. According to Mississippi's own data from their Department of Health, a Black woman - 80% of the cardiac deaths in that state occur to Black women. Black women don't make up 80% of the female population in the state but are 80% of the cardiac deaths during pregnancy. And nationally, they're three-and-a-half times more likely than white counterparts to die due to maternal mortality.\n\nBut, Amy, that's not all. If you actually look at certain counties within these anti-abortion states, then you see that Black women may be five or 10 or 15 times more likely to die by being forced to carry a pregnancy to term than by being able to have the medical care of an abortion. And it's just that glaring and alarming. And what's so stunning about it is that the Supreme Court gives no consideration to this data.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Wade . Trump repeated his false claim that Democrats support infanticide, and claimed that allowing individual states to set their own laws on abortion was an improvement. Harris highlighted the risk to pregnant people now navigating a patchwork of laws and restrictions in the U.S. and promised to restore protections for reproductive rights as president. \"Kamala Harris was finally out there channeling the outrage and the profound sense of violation that many people across this country feel in the wake of the Dobbs decision,\" says Amy Littlefield, the abortion access correspondent for The Nation .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But we have to move on right now to another key issue that was raised in the debate last night, what may be the only debate, and that is abortion. We look now at the issue of abortion. This is Donald Trump speaking on the ABC News presidential debate.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : The plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have - and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said, \"The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby.\" In other words, we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that, because that predominates, because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice-presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way, for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice-presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth - it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born - is OK. And that's not OK with me, hence the vote.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS : There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam Vice President, I want to get your response to President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS : Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that's not actually a surprising fact.\n\nLet's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade . And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide healthcare. In one state, it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest, which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\n\nI have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the healthcare providers are afraid they might go to jail, and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that. A 12- or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that.\n\nAnd I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade , as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand, in his Project 2025, there would be a national abortion - a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Kamala Harris and President Trump debating the issue of abortion in last night's ABC debate that was moderated by Linsey Davis and David Muir.\n\nIn these last few minutes we have together, Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation magazine in Boston, if you can respond to President Trump's shifting approach to abortion, and what Kamala Harris argued?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : I mean, Amy, can we just pause for a minute and talk about how sick it is that we're now almost a year into Israel's war on Gaza, and the only - and, you know, images emerging every day of mothers and fathers in Gaza weeping over the bodies of their dead infants and children, and the only dead baby we heard mention from the debate stage was a figment of Donald Trump's imagination? I mean, this talking point, which is his number one talking point on abortion, that abortions happen after birth. And we finally had a moderator who was prepared. I mean, please, let's give Linsey Davis the Pulitzer Prize for best one-liner in a presidential debate, because she nailed that, right? In no state in the country is it legal to kill an infant after birth, OK?\n\nBut, you know, I thought Kamala Harris was finally out there channeling the outrage and the profound sense of violation that many people across this country feel in the wake of the Dobbs decision. I wish she had pushed back more strongly on the issue of later abortions. You know, the issue of abortions taking place after the viability point, which, of course, you know, Roe v. Wade , that framework, which Harris said she supported, ends - the protections end, allowing states to ban abortion after that point. I wish Harris had been more staunch in defending people who need abortions later in pregnancy.\n\nBut, of course, you see Donald Trump, you know, across the board, trying to espouse basically every conceivable position on the issue. And Harris I think, finally, we have a candidate who, you know, eyes shining, talking about women bleeding out in parking lots, having their IVF treatments interrupted, was really channeling the rage and sadness that so many people feel after Dobbs .\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Amy, this whole thing of Trump claiming that he did - by the elimination of Roe v. Wade , he allowed the states to decide something that the people kept telling him that they wanted, for the state governments to decide how to control women's bodies?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : I mean, you know, again, you have this situation where Donald Trump is claiming credit for overturning Roe v. Wade , but then saying he's going to make IVF free and then saying maybe he's going to vote in favor of the abortion rights ballot initiative in Florida, but then maybe he's not, but then maybe he will again. I mean, Trump is a moving target.\n\nBut, look, we have to look at his record here. What did this man do? He overturned 50 years of precedent, right? He put the Supreme Court justices on the court to overturn Roe v. Wade . People are not going to forget that. I mean, to quote the great Taylor Swift, who of course endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz on Tuesday, \"In plain sight you hid, but you are what you did.\" OK? I don't think we're going to forget what Donald Trump did when it comes to abortion rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Amy Littlefield, we want to thank you very much for being with us. And when Taylor Swift issued that endorsement last night, she signed it \"childless cat lady\" with a photo of her cradling one of her cats. Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation .

Wade, according to a leaked draft opinion published by Politico. In it, Justice Samuel Alito writes for the majority that \"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.\" We speak to two reproductive rights advocates: attorney Kathryn \"Kitty\" Kolbert, who argued the landmark 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey case, and law professor Michele Goodwin, author of \"Policing the Womb.\" The reproductive rights movement must not only stir public outcry and depend on the courts to protect these rights, but also focus more on state-level elections to vote out anti-abortion politicians, says Kolbert. Where Roe v. Wade didn't go far enough, passing legislation such as the Women's Health Protection Act can enshrine abortion rights, says Goodwin.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights, this according to a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion published Monday night by Politico. The document is an internally circulated majority draft opinion that was written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade , the landmark decision that's guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights for half a century. In the draft, Alito also moves to overturn Planned Parenthood v. Casey , a 1992 decision credited with upholding Roe v. Wade . Alito writes, quote, \" Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. ... We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. ... It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives,\" unquote.\n\nThe leaked opinion suggests five conservative justices would vote to overturn Roe , Justice Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joining Alito. CNN reports Chief Justice John Roberts does not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade , but he would vote to uphold the Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, 13 states have so-called trigger laws that would make abortion illegal as soon as the court rules. They're among the more than 26 states the Guttmacher Institute says are likely to ban abortion soon as possible: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. Michele Goodwin is the chancellor's professor at University of California, Irvine, founding director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy, author of Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood . Also with us, from Portland, Oregon, is Kathryn \"Kitty\" Kolbert, longtime public interest attorney who argued the landmark case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992, which is credited with upholding Roe v. Wade . She's co-founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights and co-author of Controlling Women: What We Must Do Now to Save Reproductive Freedom .\n\nWell, we're going to go there in a second, Kitty Kolbert. We're going to begin with you and just get your response to this astounding, at every level, unprecedented release of a first draft of a decision, in this case one that apparently was written in February and circulated to the court, that would overturn Roe v. Wade , written by Samuel Alito. Can you respond to what you've read?\n\nKATHRYN KOLBERT : Well, it's a stunning opinion. And let me just say, I fully expected that this court would overrule Roe and Casey . That is not in contention. There has always been, since the confirmation of the Trump justices, the very strong likelihood that this would happen. But I think that the breadth of the decision, the way that they have articulated their views on this issue are so disturbing on a whole host of levels.\n\nFirst and foremost, they leave open the possibility of not just eradicating abortion rights but of eradicating all of the rights in which women have depended - reproductive rights such as the ability to use contraception, the ability to be sexual with somebody of the same sex, the ability to marry for same-sex couples - because what they say is the 14th Amendment does not include a right to privacy and that unless there is a long history of support for those rights, it will not be considered within the panoply of protected interests. That means that any rights, such as gay marriage, which has been undermined by state laws for centuries prior to the ruling last decade, are in jeopardy. And that's extraordinarily disturbing.\n\nBut let me just add one more thing, Amy, which is this is really disturbing for women on all levels. First and foremost, women immediately facing unintended pregnancies, they need to know that abortion is still legal in many places, all except Texas and perhaps Oklahoma, but the day is coming that it soon will not be.\n\nAnd second, I think we need to figure out a way to make sure that all of the women in the country who are so angry about this take political action, because the only way to respond is to vote out all of the Republicans who have made this happen, at the state level, at the federal level, at every level of our government. And we need to do that as soon as possible. There are elections this month all the way through November.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Kitty Kolbert, we've listed all of the states that are ready to act as soon as this decision came down, but what about those states that would seek to, in one way or another, protect abortion for women? What do you see happening there?\n\nKATHRYN KOLBERT : Well, I think that's very good. It's important for us to realize, however, that, geographically, those who oppose abortion will stretch from, say, Georgia all the way west to Texas and from Idaho all the way south to the Mexican border. And therefore, the states that are protective are too often on the coasts or far away from the places in which women will be unable to obtain procedures. And so, the important thing is, women are going to have to travel long, long distances, even if there are safe access points, and, second, that the ability to travel is limited to those people who have means.\n\nAnd so, yes, it's great that California and New York and Illinois and a variety of other coastal states are protecting women's rights. I hope more and more will do so. But the important thing is, it is the women who are least able to travel, the women who are low-income, who are young, who are living in rural areas, who don't have access to public transportation, who are, you know, for any number of reasons, unable to leave their jobs for three or four or five days in order to get across the country to exercise their reproductive rights, these women, the most vulnerable, who are too often women of color - let's be clear here - because they suffer from discrimination in the healthcare system, those women are significantly disadvantaged. And we need to make sure, A, that we help them in every way we can, but, B, that we turn around the politics in the bad states so that this no longer happens.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd like to bring into the conversation, as well, Michele Goodwin, chancellor's professor at the University of California, Irvine. Welcome to Democracy Now! , Professor Goodwin. Your response to this leaked decision of the Supreme Court?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : First of all, thank you so much for having me back on the show.\n\nThis is unprecedented that there would be a leaked document coming from the United States Supreme Court. But let's be clear that these are incredibly unprecedented times that we find ourselves in in the United States, with an insurrection to overturn the results of an election last year and now with the Supreme Court seeking to potentially gut Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey .\n\nThis is a first draft of an unpublished opinion, so we don't actually know what will happen. But very likely, given this draft, we will see the undoing of Roe v. Wade . And it's important that we understand that with the undoing of Roe v. Wade , just what's at stake in the United States for our democracy and the rule of law. And if we look at this within the context of our democracy and the rule of law, you see the potential for the Supreme Court to do a bit of cherry picking around equality issues, around privacy issues, about matters that relate to autonomy with people's bodies.\n\nYou also see the Supreme Court seeking to skirt empirical data that has emerged in years since Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey . What is crystallized is that the World Health Organization has said that an abortion is as safe as a penicillin shot; an abortion, a surgical abortion, one of the safest medical procedures that a person could have. But even more than that, when we look at rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, then this opinion is absolutely shocking, as shocking and horrific as we see the state-level anti-abortion laws. A woman is 14 times more likely to die in the United States by carrying a pregnancy to term than by terminating it. And so, if we fail to include that in our conversation, then we're missing what essentially is a death sentence for many women across the United States and girls.\n\nAnd let me add one layer to that. For Black women, they're are three-and-a-half times more likely to die due to maternal mortality in the United States than their white counterparts. That is a national figure. That actually doesn't tell us all that we need to know when we actually look at states like Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, where Black women may be five times, 10 times, even 17 times more likely to die in certain cities and counties in those states than their white counterparts. And so, this is not just a political performance or kind of partisanship, way beyond ideology, that we see coming from the Supreme Court. What we see is something that is very graphic in terms of what it will illustrate in terms of maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnd let me add one last piece to that, as well, is that this is not something that is conjecturing. This is actually coming from data from the CDC and from the states' departments of health and human services in those states. This is already what is taking shape, given the anti-abortion measures that have taken place in the last 10 years in those states. It's glaring, it's alarming, and this draft opinion shows just how egregious it is.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Goodwin, I want to ask you two questions. One is, this is so unprecedented. I mean, in the court's history, has there ever been a release of a draft? And this is such a significant decision. But it has not come out. Is it conceivable, given what has happened, that one of these justices might change their mind? That's number one. And number two is, this is the judiciary. I'm looking at a tweet of Nina Turner, who's running for Congress in Ohio; today, the election is taking place. She says, \"Protecting abortion rights is not a midterm pitch-Democrats have the power now. We have the majority in Congress and we have the White House. Instead of drafting fundraising emails tonight, our elected leaders should be in DC voting to codify Roe & getting rid of the filibuster,\" so making Roe v. Wade the law of the land legislatively. If you could answer both?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Yeah. So, let me start with the second part, which is that making Roe the law of the land. The Women's Health Protection Act is the legislation that has been promulgated in Congress. It's gone through the House, but it's not been able to make its way through the United States Senate. It would codify Roe . And I should just say that for those who really care about not just reproductive rights but reproductive justice, Roe doesn't actually go far enough, but this would be incredibly important, the passage of the Women's Health Protection Act. It is sound legislation. It is important that that legislation is enacted, absolutely.\n\nBut to your first question, which is whether there might be a justice that could potentially change his or her mind, there is the potential for that to happen. After first drafts of opinions, there are times in which there are justices that are moved to the other side of the vote. Will that happen with these particular justices? You know, Amy, I think it's important that we add to the conversation here that Justice Alito authored another important decision that was extraordinary, and it was the Hobby Lobby case. And in that case, Justice Alito also did a similar dance, which was to say that it's only about this particular decision; we can't look at it beyond. And what that was was striking down part of the Affordable Care Act, essentially, saying that organizations, for-profit companies could have religious identities and that those religious identities would allow them to reject part of federal law, which is to make available through their insurance programs contraception. There were a series of companies that said that \"we find ourselves to be religious,\" which was something that the Supreme Court had never upheld before, and that, secondly, \"we conflate contraception with abortion,\" and therefore sought that the Supreme Court would essentially agree to the same. And the Supreme Court did, in an opinion that was written by Justice Alito. And Justice Alito said, \"Well, this only applies to companies that have these kinds of religious views. It doesn't expand beyond this. So a company can't say, 'We have religious views, and we oppose,' let's say, 'blood transfusion, and therefore deny people who work for us from getting blood transfusions.'\" So, a justice could change their mind, and it is possible that the Women's Health Protection Act could be enacted, but neither of those things are happening today.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd like to go back to Kitty Kolbert to ask you - you wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times last year predicting the likelihood of Roe v. Wade being overturned by the court, but you wrote, quote, \"The end of Roe need not herald the end of an era of reproductive freedom. It may instead launch a new strategy that protects the fundamental human right to decide whether to have children and raise them in safety and dignity.\" Could you expand on that and what you meant there in terms of how the movement needs to move forward?\n\nKATHRYN KOLBERT : Sure. So, you know, our movement for many, many years has depended on the courts, and has depended particularly on the U.S. Supreme Court, to protect these rights. But our opponents have focused on the legislative arena, have focused on electing anti-abortion legislators at the state level and in Congress. And, yes, we can turn this around. How? By electing people who support women's equality, who support reproductive justice and rights, and who are committed in every single way to ensuring that women have access to safe, legal abortion and a whole panoply of reproductive freedoms that are necessary to protect their health.\n\nWhat does that mean? It means that we need to focus on electing champions for choice. And we can only do that by hard work. It took our opponents almost five decades to get where they have gone. But let's not forget that this was their strategy. And we, too, can turn it around. But that means that every single person listening has to commit themselves to working legislatively to flip, from red to blue, state legislators and congresspeople, because until Congress is able to act, until the Senate has a - either changes the filibuster rule or elects 60 members who are with us on this issue, we're not going to see that kind of change on a national level. But we can see change at the state level. We can beef up the states that are purple and make them blue. We can make sure we elect pro-choice governors in many states who can veto bad legislation. It is too late to make changes in many, many places right now, but there is an election every six months in this country, and we need to be active and involved in those elections to make these changes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, there has been a very serious question about whether Democrats, progressives will be particularly galvanized in the midterm elections. I mean, this certainly could be a big deciding factor, to say the least. But, Kitty Kolbert, I want to put that same question of the removing the filibuster to you, about the possibilities right now as opposed to the long term. We know that both Manchin and Senator Sinema have said they are opposed to that, but do you think there is a possible move in that direction? You have Democrats controlling the presidency, the Senate and the House.\n\nKATHRYN KOLBERT : Well, I would hope so. If there's ever an opportunity to have them change their mind, this would present just one. But, first of all, it's not going to happen without a huge public outcry. That means calling senators from your state and every other state as quickly and as often as possible and make sure they hear our anger. But we also can't forget that politicians at all levels of our system vote on these issues and are controlled, in the most part, by our votes, and so we need to send the message not just to the Senate but to those state legislators who have bought into the Republican strategy, and say, \"It's time for you to find a new job.\" There's lots of gubernatorial races across this country, in Georgia, in Texas. One of the best messages we could send is to retire the governors in those states who are Republican, who are anti-choice, and say to the country, \"We are able to elect our people, and we think this issue is just too important to ignore.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what about the significance of Chief Justice Roberts? What does it mean that he would uphold the ban but was not willing to overturn Roe v. Wade ? Now, again, this is a draft. Things could change. This hasn't been released. The final decision could come as late as the beginning of July.\n\nKATHRYN KOLBERT : Well, I would say, Amy, that, A, the chief justice is irrelevant. It only takes five votes, remember. Five is the key number. But, more importantly, the only way that the chief justice could uphold this ban is to say that states have the ability to define viability on their own. And that means that the next week the next state is going to say the ban starts at 14 weeks or 13 weeks or 12 weeks. There is no way, under the current law, for the chief justice to uphold a 15-week ban without so undermining Roe and Casey that they are essentially meaningless. So, I really think that's a red herring. It's not something that's true to the way the law works. And the rights we know are really controlled by the five ultraconservative justices, and I don't see any wiggle room there. These are not people who are concerned about women's health and women's equality. They have an agenda. They've been put on the court to enact their agenda, and that's what they're doing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kathryn \"Kitty\" Kolbert, we thank you so much for being with us, lawyer who argued the landmark case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992, credited with upholding Roe v. Wade . She's co-founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights, co-author of Controlling Women: What We Must Do Now to Save Reproductive Freedom . And thanks also to Michele Goodwin, the chancellor's professor at University of California, Irvine, author of Policing the Womb .\n\nNext up, as President Biden seeks $33 billion more for Ukraine, we look at the dangers of U.S. military escalation with Medea Benjamin of CodePink and George Beebe of the Quincy Institute, former head of Russia analysis at the CIA . He's also a former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "US supreme court overturns abortion rights, upending Roe v Wade\n\nBiden calls ruling in pivotal case Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization 'a tragic error'\n\nThe supreme court has ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion in the United States, upending the landmark Roe v Wade case from nearly 50 years ago in a rare reversal of long-settled law that will fracture reproductive rights in America.\n\nJoe Biden called the ruling a \"tragic error\" and the Republicans celebrating it \"wrong, extreme and out of touch\".\n\nThe court, the president said, had pointed America down \"an extreme and dangerous path\". Sounding an alarm over a concurring opinion by the conservative justice Clarence Thomas, Biden said key rights including same-sex marriage and access to contraception could now be targeted by the rightwing court.\n\nHe said: \"Justice Thomas said as much today. He explicitly called to reconsider the right of marriage equality. The right of couples to make their choices on contraception.\n\n\"This is an extreme and dangerous path the court has now taken us on.\"\n\nThe ruling, handed down a day after the court overturned a New York gun control law , came in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, in which the last abortion clinic in Mississippi opposed state efforts to ban abortion after 15 weeks and overturn Roe.\n\n\"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" said the majority opinion, written by Samuel Alito and joined by four other conservatives, referring also to a 1992 ruling which buttressed Roe. \"The constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said he would have upheld Mississippi's law but not overruled Roe.\n\nThe three liberal justices dissented, saying the majority opinion \"says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of\", and that conservatives well knew states would enact - and in many cases had already enacted - abortion restrictions to the moment of conception.\n\nUnder state restrictions, \"a woman will have to bear her rapist's child or a young girl her father's - no matter if doing so will destroy her life\", the liberal justices wrote.\n\nAt least 26 states are expected to ban abortion immediately or as soon as practicable. The Republican attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, celebrated the ruling and said : \"Abortion is illegal here.\"\n\nThe Dobbs decision is one of the most consequential in generations. It will have profound, immediate and enduring consequences for tens of millions of women and other people who can become pregnant. Ripple effects could play out over decades.\n\n\"Even if it's not completely unprecedented it's extremely rare,\" said Mary Ziegler, a visiting professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion. \"It's also extraordinary to do something like this so quickly, with no kind of advance notice.\"\n\nA draft opinion , in which Alito laid out a caustic argument for reversing Roe v Wade, was leaked in May.\n\nSwaths of the south and midwest are expected to ban abortion or impose severe restrictions, possibly forcing patients to travel hundreds of miles or self-manage abortions .\n\nAt least one economist has estimated such bans could result in 60,000 births a year among women unable to obtain an abortion, affecting 41% of women of reproductive age and hitting young, poor, Black and brown women and people who already have children hardest.\n\nAs Biden indicated, the decision could also herald restrictions in other areas of private life. In his opinion, Thomas explicitly encouraged fellow justices to \"reconsider all of this court's\" cases that establish rights to contraception and gay marriage and sex.\n\nThomas did not mention interracial marriage, another right many fear could be targeted. Thomas is Black. His wife, the far-right activist Ginni Thomas, is white.\n\nMassive protests erupted outside the courthouse and in major cities and smaller towns across the US after the decision was announced. Democratic-run states and cities have vowed to uphold abortion rights and welcome people from neighboring states with bans, and some district attorneys have pledged not to prosecute people for abortions even if new laws criminalize the procedure.\n\n\"Backlash to the decision is really unpredictable, and part of the reason we know that is because backlash to Roe was unpredictable,\" said Ziegler.\n\nDr Iffath A Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: \"Today's decision is a direct blow to bodily autonomy, reproductive health, patient safety and health equity in the United States.\n\n\"The principle of shared decision-making is founded on respect for people's expertise in their own bodies and lives and clinicians' expertise in science and medicine. There is no room within the sanctuary of the patient-physician relationship for individual lawmakers who wish to impose their personal religious or ideological views on others.\"\n\nDemocratic-led states have enacted laws to aid patients who travel for abortions. Republican-led states have worked to further restrict abortion. Some have debated prosecuting women who seek abortions under homicide statutes.\n\nAlthough an estimated 85% of Americans support legal abortion under certain circumstances, partisan manipulation of electoral districts has insulated Republican leaders from popular opinion.\n\nBiden pointed to the midterm elections in November.\n\nHe said: \"This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality. They are on the ballot.\n\n\"Until then, I will do all my power to protect a woman's right in states where they will face the consequences of today's decision.\n\n\"Though the court's decision cast a dark shadow over large swaths of the land, many states still recognize a woman's right to choose. So if a woman lives in a state that restricts abortion, the supreme court's decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home state to the state that allows it. It does not prevent a doctor in that state from treating her.\n\n\"As the attorney general has made clear, women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek care they need. My administration will defend that bedrock right. If any state or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack.\"\n\nThe leak of the draft Roe decision prompted protests, some near justices' homes. Biden called for protests to remain peaceful, saying: \"No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable.\"\n\nAmong Republican-led states , Missouri claimed to be first to ban abortion. South Dakota announced a special session to consider more restrictions.\n\nIn Illinois, the Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, called the general assembly into special session \"to further enshrine our commitment to reproductive healthcare rights and protections\".\n\nThe US is one of only four countries since 1994 to restrict abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, the others being Poland, Nicaragua and El Salvador. This will further set America apart from peer countries as life expectancy falls . It could also damage efforts to advocate for the rights of women and girls globally ."

      "text": "What is Roe v Wade and how does it affect abortion rights in the US?\n\nA woman's right to have an abortion through the first trimester of pregnancy was protected nationally in 1973 following the supreme court's landmark ruling\n\nA leaked initial draft majority opinion suggests the US supreme court is poised to vote to overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Politico reported on Monday.\n\nThe supreme court and the White House have declined to comment.\n\nA woman's right to have an abortion through the first trimester of pregnancy was protected nationally in 1973, following the supreme court's landmark 7-2 ruling.\n\nPlaintiff Jane Roe, later identified as Norma McCorvey, was an unmarried pregnant woman who was unable to get an abortion under Texas law, where it was illegal unless to save the life of the mother.\n\nRoe's lawyers said she was unable to travel out of the state to obtain an abortion and argued the law was too vague and infringed on her constitutional rights.\n\n\"Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us,\" supreme court justice Harry Blackmun, a Republican nominated by the president Richard Nixon, wrote in the sweeping majority opinion that detailed attitudes about abortion from the time of the Persian empire.\n\nThe Texas law infringed on women's right to privacy, was overly broad and violated the due process clause in the US constitution's 14th amendment, the decision said.\n\n\"This right of privacy ... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent.\n\n\"Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it.\n\n\"In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.\"\n\nFive Republican-nominated judges were among the majority. The court ruled the state could regulate the procedure during the second trimester and even ban it in most circumstances in the third.\n\n\"We do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake,\" Blackmun wrote.\n\n\"We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct.\"\n\nJustices Byron White, a Democratic appointee, and Republican-nominated William Rehnquist, later US chief justice, dissented.\n\nThe decision provoked a firestorm among social and judicial conservatives, who have long sought to undermine or overturn it."

      "text": "A 'fundamental' right: a timeline of US abortion rights since Roe v Wade\n\nWhen the all-male supreme court ruled to protect abortion rights in 1973, activists didn't foresee the fight that lay ahead\n\nThe landmark 1973 supreme court case Roe v Wade guaranteed the right to an abortion in the United States.\n\nNow, nearly five decades later, that right is under threat as the court prepares to hear oral arguments in a new case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization.\n\nHow could a decision that was not met with widespread protest at the time be under threat less than half a century later?\n\nOver the years, a vocal minority of socially conservative Americans have steadily gained political power, passed many state-level challenges to the decision and, in some extreme cases, resorted to violence and intimidation in an attempt to reduce access to abortion.\n\nAlthough six in 10 adults in the US say abortion should be legal in \" all or most \" circumstances, Congress has never enshrined the right to terminate a pregnancy in statute. That has left abortion access vulnerable during a period of sustained legal attacks during the Trump administration and led to the precarious position of abortion rights in the US today.\n\nHere are some of the key moments in the almost 50 years that have passed since the Roe v Wade ruling.\n\nIn a 7-2 decision , the all-male supreme court ruled that the constitution protects the right to an abortion. Justices found abortion was a \"fundamental\" right for a woman's \"life and future\", and that Texas had violated the rights of \"Jane Roe\" when an abortion ban prevented her from obtaining one.\n\n\"When the decision came down, we were elated,\" said Eleanor Smeal, who was active in the feminist movement at the time and who is now president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. \"It was a celebration, it was happiness, and people thought the fight was over - we won.\"\n\n\"The movement wasn't thinking of, 'Oh my God, we're going to have to fight to protect this,'\" Smeal added. \"We couldn't imagine anyone would hammer away.\"\n\nThe decision was preceded by decades of activism, with momentum decidedly on the side of those working to liberalize abortion laws. Constituencies as diverse as radical feminists, clergy and doctors came together to call for reform to criminal abortion laws.\n\n\"There was a big movement for legalizing abortion before the supreme court decision. I think people forget that,\" Smeal said. \"We talk about back-alley abortion but [women] were dying\".\n\nPeople, especially those on low incomes, gained access to safe and legal abortion up to the point a fetus could survive outside the womb. Big-city hospitals shuttered \"septic abortion\" wards , where many poor people had died, infected and injured, from desperate attempts to end pregnancies.\n\nPeople also gained access to abortion through Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income people and those living with disabilities. Abortion joined contraceptives, legalized for unmarried people just one year earlier, as a newly available method of family planning.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement as we know it today had yet to coalesce, but the stridently anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ North Carolina US senator Jesse Helms did successfully pass the Helms amendment, which banned the use of foreign health aid to promote \"abortion as a method of family planning\" overseas. The amendment remains in effect.\n\nThe Hyde amendment, a temporary budget rider that barred Medicaid from paying for abortions, passed in the House of Representatives with a large majority. It was encouraged by Catholic bishops, and, unlike in today's polarized environment, votes were not split strictly along party lines. More than 100 Democrats supported the measure, and 32 Republicans opposed it.\n\nAt the time, some representatives argued the Hyde amendment unfairly discriminated against poor people. The law, still in place, has made it far more difficult for low-income people to obtain abortions, often forcing them to pay hundreds of dollars for the procedure. Three-quarters of people who seek abortions in the US are low-income. The policy disproportionately affects people of color.\n\nThis period would represent a turning point in Republican politics. Republican political activists such as Phyllis Schlafly worked to bring together evangelicals and conservative Catholics by uniting them in concern about women's changing place in society and how they would exercise new rights, such as abortion. Until then, legal abortion had been supported by many Republicans .\n\n\"Schlafly and her supporters argue that 1960s liberalism celebrates the individual and promotes the rights of the individual at the expense of the family and at the expense of a kind of moral order,\" the Harvard historian Jill Lepore told On the Media . \"Abortion becomes a linchpin\" for this argument, she added.\n\nThe same year, the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University , a Christian college that defiantly refused to admit Black students on \"religious liberty\" grounds. The Dartmouth University religious history professor Randall Balmer argued this was an important moment in activating white evangelical protestant voters, or the \"moral majority\", who would join many Catholic voters in being receptive to anti-abortion political messaging.\n\nEvangelical opposition to abortion \"was a kind of historical accident\", said Balmer, who details this history in his recent book Bad Faith: Race and the Rise of the Religious Right. \"It allowed them to deflect attention away from the real narrative and to advocate on behalf of the fetus.\"\n\nPennsylvania passed among the most stringent abortion restrictions in the nation with the Abortion Control Act , which required minors to gain parental consent to obtain an abortion, imposed a 24-hour waiting period on women seeking abortions and required married women to notify their husbands if they were seeking an abortion.\n\nAlthough it was not the first state or city to enact such impediments, it became the most significant, because its law survived a court challenge. The early 1980s also saw the rise of the religious right with the election of President Ronald Reagan, who voiced support for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.\n\nLitigation against Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act reached the supreme court in a case called Planned Parenthood v Casey . The court upheld the essential ruling in Roe v Wade but allowed states to pass more abortion restrictions as long as they did not pose an \"undue burden\".\n\nThe decision ushered in a new era of anti-abortion restrictions, which would come to be known as Trap laws, referring to targeted regulation of abortion providers. States passed hundreds of expensive and burdensome restrictions, often in an effort to test the constitutional limits of the court's new ruling.\n\nThe same year, President Bill Clinton said abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare\" , a phrase later seen as a symbol of the Democratic party's acceptance of the idea that abortion was shameful.\n\nEven as Casey ushered in a new era of incremental abortion restrictions and abortion access dwindled, anti-abortion zealots saw the case as a loss. Frustrated, some turned to violence and intimidation, organizing blockades of clinics. Their tactics culminated in the assassination of Dr David Gunn , who was shot dead outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. Eleven people have been murdered as a result of attacks on abortion providers since 1977.\n\n\"Anti-abortion forces got very extreme in the 1980s and 90s,\" said Laura Briggs, author of How All Politics Became Reproductive Politics: from Welfare Reform to Foreclosure to Trump. \"First they started bombing clinics and murdering providers, and formed the nucleus of the alt-right that we're now living with as white nationalists.\"\n\nTwo Planned Parenthood receptionists, Shannon Lowney, 25, and Leanne Nichols, 38, were killed and five more people injured at separate shootings by the same perpetrator in suburban Boston. The same year, Dr John Bayard Britton , 69, and James Barrett, 74, a clinic security volunteer, were shot and killed by an anti-abortion extremist outside another Pensacola clinic.\n\nA Canadian man shot Dr Barnett Slepian - a Buffalo, New York, abortion provider - through his kitchen window with a high-powered rifle. The perpetrator remained free for five years before he was apprehended.\n\nThe same year, a nail bomb exploded outside a Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic, killing an off-duty police officer, Robert Sanderson. The man responsible, Eric Rudolph, eventually pleaded guilty to the 1996 bombing of the Atlanta Olympics, as well as bombings at two more abortion clinics and a gay bar.\n\nThe FDA approved the drug mifepristone - the first pill available to end a pregnancy early in gestation. In the coming decades, the drug proved extremely safe and effective, and was used by millions. By 2017, mifepristone accounted for 39% of all abortions.\n\nHowever, it also became the target of attacks and disinformation. Some states required a doctor to be in the room when dispensing the medication, effectively banning telemedicine abortions . In others, anti-science disinformation about the ability to \"reverse\" a medication abortion was allowed to flourish .\n\nThe supreme court upheld a federal ban on dilation and extraction, a procedure opponents call \" partial birth abortion \". In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled a ban on the procedure was constitutional, even though it was designed to lead to fewer complications for pregnant people. The decision weakened Roe, which held that a pregnant person's health should be paramount.\n\n2009\n\nDr George Tiller was shot and killed in the entrance of his church in Wichita, Kansas, by an anti-abortion extremist. Tiller was one of the few abortion providers in the country willing to perform the procedure late in pregnancy.\n\nTexas passed a law that required abortion providers to have \"admitting privileges\" at local hospitals. The requirement proved impossible for many doctors to meet, shut down dozens of clinics in Texas, and was then replicated by other states. The midwest and south became the epicenters of anti-abortion legislation.\n\nThe same year, North Dakota passed the nation's first \" heartbeat bill \", a ban on abortion after roughly six weeks. That is before most people know they are pregnant and before the vast majority of abortions take place.\n\nAt the time it was passed, mainstream anti-abortion activists believed it was too extreme and would only serve to bolster Roe.\n\nA man opened fire at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood, killing three people and wounding nine more . His victims were later identified as Jennifer Markovsky , 35; Ke'Arre Stewart , 29; and Garrett Swasey , 44.\n\nThe same year, the supreme court struck down Texas's \"admitting privileges\" law in a 5-3 decision, ruling the burdens placed on people were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the damage was done - most of the clinics that closed when Texas enacted the law remain shuttered.\n\nDonald Trump was elected president. Running as a Republican on the campaign trail, he said people who had abortions should be punished and promised to appoint supreme court justices to \"automatically\" overturn Roe. He was carried to victory with strong support from the religious right. Trump confirmed three justices to the court during his term in office - Neil Gorsuch , Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - giving conservatives a 6-3 super-majority.\n\nSeveral more states passed so-called \"heartbeat bills\" - including Ohio and Georgia - even though the laws were blatantly unconstitutional and were blocked by courts. The author of the bills is an anti-LGBTQ+ conspiracy theorist whom anti-abortion activists once considered too extreme, but who found new purchase in the Trump era.\n\nEmboldened by Trump, the anti-abortion movement sees more grassroots efforts to outlaw abortion entirely. New York and Illinois expand abortion rights in response to near constant attacks in other states and from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic hit, and much of normal life came to a standstill. Hospitals and clinics across the country suspended normal operations. Ten states attempted to restrict abortion as a \"nonessential\" service. Courts intervened and many restrictions were lifted, though many measures had already sown confusion.\n\nThe same year, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, hailed by some as the court's greatest champion of reproductive health and freedom, died at age 87. The Trump administration quickly confirmed her successor - Barrett.\n\nBy May, the supreme court agreed to consider Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, alarming activists who worry the case could be used to significantly weaken the right to abortion.\n\nThe case focuses on whether Mississippi can outlaw most abortions at 15 weeks, a direct challenge to Roe, which provides a right to abortion up to the point the fetus can live outside the womb, widely regarded as 24 weeks gestation. A full-term pregnancy is 39 weeks.\n\nBy mid-year , 2021 has already become the most hostile year for abortion rights legislation on record, with more than 90 restrictions put in place by states. In July, attorneys for Mississippi asked the court to use the Dobbs case to overturn Roe v Wade, and called the 1973 decision one which has \"poisoned our national discourse\" and \"plagued the law\".\n\nBy September, the supreme court had let Texas's six-week abortion ban go into effect while it was litigated, halting the vast majority of abortions in the country's second-biggest state. Experts called Roe v Wade a \" dessicated husk \" of a ruling.\n\nThe court shocked observers again in September, when it allowed Texas to implement a six-week abortion ban. In effect, Texas nullifies the constitutional rights granted by Roe v Wade within its borders.\n\nIf the Mississippi case leads to the fall of Roe v Wade when the court issues its decision in 2022, and abortion restrictions are left to the states, more than half would be likely to move to again make the procedure illegal.\n\nDr Wendy Chavkin, a special lecturer in population and family health and clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University who helped found Global Doctors for Choice, said such a decisionwould set the US back decades.\n\n\"If this thing goes wrong, we're bucking the historic tide\" of liberalizing abortion laws globally, said Chavkin. \"It'll be like some of those decisions that the US is - embarrassed is an inadequate word - but profoundly embarrassed by for years and we'll have a lot of trouble ameliorating the harms that will result.\""

      "text": "A year ago Roe v Wade was overturned. Grieve for the new America\n\nThe supreme court's decision has created a two-tiered class of US citizenship: one for men and one for women. It is a generational tragedy\n\nT hat it has only been a year since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and ended the federal right to an abortion feels absurd, almost impossible. How horribly and dramatically our country has changed since then. In a span of just 12 months, thousands of lives have been permanently changed - dreams dashed, intentions scuttled, childhoods abruptly ended, talents and potential suppressed, health risked, and the self-determination of pregnant women snatched from them by a body of unelected jurists who believe that their own sentiments are more important than those women's dignity.\n\nThe decision unleashed atrocities and morbid perversions of medical ethics that have rapidly become routine. Women experiencing miscarriages now wait around in emergency rooms and parking lots, unable to receive treatment until they sicken to the point where sufficiently brutal health outcomes (life-ending or life-altering, depending on the state) become a certainty. Other women, and no small number of girls, now gestate and give birth to infants conceived by their rapists - their coaches, abusive boyfriends, acquaintances, priests, fathers. Still others are forced into torturously monstrous exercises in medical futility, their bodies commandeered and used by the state to birth babies without lungs or heads.\n\nAny one of these scenarios is the stuff of a horror movie, episodes of legally mandated medical sadism that makes a mockery of the principles of liberty, equality, privacy or due process. But the anti-choice movement also seems to be determined to bring an end to free speech: when an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, spoke to the media about performing an abortion on a raped 10-year-old girl who had had to flee Ohio for the procedure, Indiana state Republicans set about a year-long campaign of harassment and intimidation meant to punish her for speaking publicly about the reality that their policies had created.\n\nAll of this was predictable. All of it was, in fact, predicted by the pro-choice movement, whose size, institutional knowledge and internal variance did not earn it respect from either the Democratic establishment or the movement left. And it was all predicted, too, by the anti-choice movement, one of the largest and best-funded hate campaigns in the nation's history, whose habitual bad faith and single-minded commitment to ensuring women's suffering ushered in the human rights catastrophe of the post-Dobbs era entirely on purpose.\n\nThe Dobbs decision itself was not a surprise. Republicans held a commanding six-three supermajority on the court, ever since the appointment of the arch-conservative and devout Catholic justice Amy Coney Barrett, and the plaintiffs in Dobbs, the case that provided the court the excuse to end Roe, had revised their filings to ask for a more extreme ruling as soon as she was confirmed. Activists in the anti-choice movement, and the Republicans who do their bidding, dispensed with pretense and began introducing the bills they really wanted. Laws that criminalized women for seeking abortions were introduced; laws eliminating the fig-leaf \"rape, incest and life of the mother\" exemptions that the anti-choice set had long hid behind passed, and are now standard.\n\nNone of the ensuing atrocities should have come as a surprise to anyone with an interest in women's rights, because they were not a surprise: they were the anti-choice movement's design. Even the opinion itself leaked ahead of time, with a draft of Samuel Alito's rambling, contemptuous and ahistorical opinion published in Politico a month before the formal ruling.\n\nStill, the Biden administration was inexplicably and unforgivably flat-footed in the response, seemingly caught off-guard by an outcome that they had been warned about more than a month in advance. Members of the administration seemed, if anything, a bit irritated by the demand for action, and it emerged just days after the Dobbs decision went into effect that the Biden administration was in fact planning to appoint Chad Meredith , an anti-choice lawyer, to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench. The nomination was only dropped after an outcry from an irate nation.\n\nFor months, it seemed a victory when the clearly indifferent Biden so much as said the word abortion. When the decision came down, the Biden administration had no interest in using executive power to help women exercise their rights, and no plan to restore access, to redignify American women, or to mitigate the unspeakable harm that was coming. They still don't.\n\nFor months, abortion flickered in and out of legality in many states, like a fluorescent light with a moth caught in it, as lawsuits ascended through the courts and judicial stays either permitted or prohibited women from exercising authority over their own lives. But in the 13 states with so-called trigger laws - enacted by anti-choice Republicans in drooling anticipation of the day the court overturned Roe - the Dobbs decision meant that abortion was banned immediately. In these states, abortion providers rushed to perform as many procedures as they could before the bans went into effect, while women wept on the phone lines and in the waiting rooms, like passengers awaiting the last plane out of a war-torn country.\n\nThis was the stuff of another horror movie: the dwindling hours, the ticking minutes, that separated these women from a world where they were full citizens, endowed with the dignity to determine their own family futures and sexual lives, and one where they were transformed in law into something else, something lesser. Now, a new and chaotic legal regime has emerged, where women are full citizens in some states, something more like children in others. It is not a situation that will hold. The anti-abortion movement, and the Republicans who serve it, has every intention of pursuing a national ban, and all the resources needed to achieve it in our lifetimes.\n\nAmid all the brutality, all the horrific medical emergencies, all the women sickening to the brink of death, all the girls forced to remain pregnant with the children of their rapists while still children themselves, there is one central feature of Dobbs and its aftermath that hangs over every crude discussion of gestational limits and unspeakably vulgar argument over rape exemptions, this is the elephant in the room: that history does move backwards, that America does not advance all of its peoples steadily toward inclusion and justice, and that Dobbs diminished the citizenship of half of America because of their sex. It came as women attained new heights of education and achievement - it aims to reverse them. It came as trans people achieved new levels of visibility and acceptance as their true selves - it aimed to shove them back into a social role determined by their sex assigned at birth.\n\nDobbs created a two-tiered class of American citizenship: one for those who are trusted to plan their families and control their bodies, because they are male, and one for those who are not, because they are female. It is a generational tragedy.\n\nThis is not the kind of thing we are accustomed to memorializing in America: the lost dreams, the ruined health, the unwritten novels and symphonies, the early deaths, the searing and profound humiliation. We do not like to dwell on our failures, our violences, our ignoble reversals. But it is worth dwelling on this one today. Take a moment to remember the women who have been denied abortions since Dobbs - those who are hurt and threatened by their pregnancies, and those who simply do not want them - and grieve for them. Grieve, and wonder about what other lives they might have led, if they had a choice.\n\nMoira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"

      "text": "Permanent contraception surged after Roe v Wade overturned, study finds\n\nYoung adults living in states likely to ban abortion obtained tubal sterilizations and vasectomies in months after ruling\n\nIn the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade , permanent contraception in the form of tubal sterilizations and vasectomies surged among young adults living in states likely to ban abortion, new research released on Monday found.\n\nCompared to May 2022, when the opinion overturning Roe leaked, August 2022 saw 95% more vasectomies and 70% more tubal sterilizations performed on people between the ages of 19 and 26, according to the study, which was conducted by researchers at the George Washington University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan.\n\nIn addition to analyzing data about medical visits for permanent contraception before and after the opinion's leak, the researchers also examined survey responses from more than 600 people between the ages of 14 and 24 who were asked about the fall of Roe.\n\n\"It has made me want to be sterilized more,\" said one 24-year-old female survey respondent from the US south. \"The pill isn't 100% effective and I'm afraid of losing access to it, and I do not want children in the future and would much rather be sterilized. I'm afraid of getting pregnant and not being able to make decisions for myself.\"\n\nPublished in the journal Health Affairs, the study also found that, overall, tubal sterilizations - which surgically alter women's fallopian tubes and are colloquially known as \"getting tubes tied\" - were more popular than vasectomies. There were about seven more tubal sterilizations performed per state a month in the second half of 2022, compared to roughly three more vasectomies a month per state.\n\nThat popularity probably reflects the longstanding expectation that women shoulder the burden of contraception. But Julia Strasser, the study's lead author, suspects that there may be other reasons, too.\n\n\"My guess is that it's because people, who may be pursuing these methods because they fear that they will no longer have access to abortion services, may feel like they want to be the ones who are protecting their own sort of bodily autonomy versus relying on a partner,\" said Strasser, who is also the director of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health at the George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.\n\nTuesday's study is the only latest piece of evidence indicating that more people sought permanent contraception in the wake of Roe's collapse. Last year, another study also discovered that the rates of people under 30 who underwent tubal ligations and vasectomies increased after Roe fell. That study, however, did not break down its findings by state.\n\nTo analyze patients' interest in permanent contraception, Strasser and her co-authors relied on data from the health information company IQVIA, which broke down patient visits for permanent contraception in 2021 and 2022. Rather than examine states that enacted post-Roe abortion bans, the researchers split states into those that were thought likely to outlaw abortion versus those likely to protect it. Fear over a potential ban, they reasoned, could make someone want permanent contraception.\n\nThe study may in fact be underestimating the post-Roe demand for permanent contraception among young adults, Strasser said, since it focused on individuals who actually underwent tubal sterilizations and vasectomies. Even when they are sure they do not want children, young people often struggle to find medical providers who will perform those services on them.\n\n\"We don't want them to be seeking them out of fear or concerns about their safety,\" Strasser said. \"But also, I think it's important to recognize that young people, young adults, have autonomy over their contraceptive and reproductive health choices.\""

      "text": "'Tip of the iceberg': US self-managed abortions soar post-Roe, study shows\n\nAnalysis of data from suppliers outside US health system suggests abortion pills used by more people than thought to evade bans\n\nIn the six months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, roughly 26,000 more Americans used pills to induce their own at-home abortions than would have done so if Roe had not fallen, according to a new study .\n\nPublished on Monday in Jama, one of the leading peer-reviewed medical journals in the United States, the study comes ahead of a key Tuesday hearing at the US supreme court at which the justices will hear oral arguments in a case that could determine the future of a major abortion pill, mifepristone.\n\nPills are used in 63% of all abortions within the US healthcare system, and the study suggests they are being used by even more people than previously known in order to evade abortion restrictions that now blanket much of the US.\n\nAnalyzing data from abortion pill suppliers who operate outside of the US healthcare system, the study provides a rare window into the growing practice known as \"self-managed abortion\". Although definitions of self-managed abortion can vary, the practice generally refers to abortions that take place outside the formal healthcare system, without the aid of a US-based clinician.\n\nThe June 2022 decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe and unleashed a wave of near-total abortion bans across much of the US south and midwest, led to an explosion of interest in self-managed abortion, the study found.\n\n\"Where an abortion ban is in place, it's very common for large numbers of people to look outside the formal healthcare setting to meet their needs,\" said Dr Abigail Aiken, the lead author on the study and an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. \"What was once considered a very sort of marginal practice now seems mainstream.\"\n\nThe supreme court will consider arguments to roll back recent measures taken by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to dramatically expand access to mifepristone, such as erasing requirements for people to pick up the pill in person. Those changes paved the way for US providers to start offering telehealth abortions within the formal healthcare system, including to people who live in states with abortion bans; a recent analysis found that telehealth abortions now account for 16% of all abortions.\n\nHowever, regardless of what the court does, its actions will not affect the thriving market for self-managed abortion, because suppliers tend to source their pills from overseas pharmacies based in countries such as India.\n\n\"There's not a way for the government to really police that system very effectively,\" said Elisa Wells, another author on the paper and the co-director of Plan C, which runs an online database of organizations that offer abortion pills. \"It's unlikely to have much impact at all, except to maybe drive up the demand for those services.\"\n\nWells also believes that, should the supreme court try to curtail access to mifepristone, the resulting outrage will strengthen abortion pill suppliers. \"Every time there's an egregious court decision, that fuels activists and providers for finding new routes of access to help people access pills in the United States,\" she said.\n\nMedical experts widely agree that it is physically safe to self-manage an abortion early on in pregnancy, and the World Health Organization even offers a protocol for doing so. It is also technically legal to end your own pregnancy in almost every state, including in the 16 states that have enacted near-total abortion bans. (Nevada has a law that explicitly criminalizes self-managed abortion later on in pregnancy.) Abortion bans generally target abortion providers, not patients.\n\nHowever, experts have long warned that, if a prosecutor wants to punish someone for a self-managed abortion, they will find a statute that is elastic enough to use. Even before the fall of Roe, people had faced criminal consequences over alleged self-managed abortions. Between 2000 and 2020, 61 people were criminally investigated or arrested on suspicion of ending their own pregnancies or helping someone else do so, an October 2023 report found .\n\nThe study released on Monday examined the provision of pills from three different kinds of providers: community networks, which are groups of volunteers who usually offer pills free of charge; telemedicine organizations that provide pills with the aid of clinicians who are based outside the United States; and online vendors, which are straightforward businesses that simply sell pills.\n\nThe study's authors obtained data directly from most of these sources, although the authors also used statistical modeling to estimate how many pills may be provided from other sources that did not supply data to researchers. Including those estimates, researchers reported that these suppliers provided almost 40,000 pills in the six months following the demise of Roe. Had Roe not fallen, the researchers estimated that they would have provided closer to 10,000 pills.\n\nIn the six months after Roe, suppliers provided almost 6,000 pills for self-managed abortions each month, the study found. That's a monthly increase of more than 300% compared with before the fall of Roe. More than half of all these pills were provided by community networks.\n\nUsing past studies as well as providers' own estimates of how often their pills were used, researchers also calculated how many more self-managed abortions took place after Roe compared with how many would have taken place had the landmark ruling survived. Ultimately, they estimated that 26,055 more self-managed abortions took place than if Roe had not fallen.\n\nThe landscape of self-managed abortion has probably changed dramatically even since the end of the period captured in the study, which ended in December 2022, Aiken and Wells said. More and more vendors have entered the marketplace, driving down the cost of pills. Community networks are seeing increased requests this year, Wells added.\n\nThe numbers in the Monday study, she said, \"are the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's happening out there\"."

      "text": "More than 200 pregnancy-related prosecutions in first year post-Roe\n\nStudy finds highest yearly number of prosecutions related to pregnancy - and experts say that is likely an undercount\n\nIn the year Roe v Wade was overturned, at least 200 people in the US were prosecuted for conduct relating to their pregnancies - the highest number of cases in a single year ever recorded, according to a new report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe report, compiled by the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice, is the first comprehensive accounting of pregnancy-related criminal charges between June 2022 and June 2023, but researchers warn that it is still probably an undercount.\n\n\"To be perfectly honest, I think we're scratching the surface of what is happening,\" said Wendy Bach, a University of Tennessee law professor and the report's principal investigator.\n\nThe vast majority of prosecutions documented in the report do not involve abortions. However, five cases mention allegations of an abortion, an attempted abortion, or \"researching or exploring the possibility of an abortion\", according to the report. Only one was charged under a statute meant to criminalize abortions. The rest involved a bevy of other laws, such as a statute that bans the \"abuse of a corpse\".\n\nFour of those cases took place in states that ban abortion or are hostile to the procedure.\n\nMore than 200 of the 210 recorded prosecutions involve allegations of substance use during pregnancy. In almost 200 of the cases, prosecutors charged people using statutes that criminalize child abuse, neglect, or endangerment - charges that treat an embryo or fetus as a person, complete with rights and protections that may compete with that of the person carrying them. More than 100 prosecutions recorded by Pregnancy Justice took place in Alabama, a state whose supreme court recently ruled that embryos were \"extrauterine children\".\n\nMost of the cases also involved statutes under which prosecutors do not need to prove that any harm was done to a fetus or infant. Rather, prosecutors must show that a defendant posed some \"risk\" to the pregnancy - which could lead to criminalization of behavior that is not actually dangerous, advocates say.\n\n\"It's ultimately, a lot of the time, based on someone's perceptions of risky behavior, however they might define it, and it's often based on stereotypes or outdated notions,\" said Zenovia Earle, media and communications director for Pregnancy Justice.\n\nPeople have faced criminal consequences over their pregnancies even before Roe fell. In just one example, Alabama police arrested Ashley Caswell, then two months pregnant, in 2021 for allegedly testing positive for methamphetamine and \"endangering\" her fetus, the Guardian reported last year . Jailed for the rest of her pregnancy, Caswell was forced to deliver her baby alone, in a jail shower, according to court and medical records.\n\nOver three-quarters of the cases uncovered by Pregnancy Justice also involved defendants who are low-income.\n\nTwenty-two of the cases involved fetal or infant demise. For Bach, this is evidence that, in a post-Roe country, \"pregnancy loss is suspect\" .\n\n\"The idea that the fetus can be a person and a victim of a crime is being wielded in significant ways when there's a pregnancy loss,\" Bach said. \"So rather than meeting a pregnancy loss with care, with support, with an acknowledgement for the often tragic life circumstances that that involves - we are meeting it with criminal suspicion, with criminal investigation and with prosecution.\"\n\nOn Monday, KFF Health News shared the story of a 23-year-old woman who miscarried in South Carolina, and was arrested in June 2023 and charged with \"murder/homicide by child abuse\". The woman, Amari Marsh, was held in jail for 22 days, then was placed under house arrest, and had her case cleared by a grand jury in August - 13 months after leaving jail. Marsh was facing the possibility of 20 years to life in prison.\n\nSouth Carolina's abortion ban was not in effect at the time of Marsh's arrest; today, abortion in the state is banned after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn another high-profile case, a grand jury declined to pursue the case of Brittany Watts, an Ohio woman who reportedly miscarried into a toilet last year. A nurse reportedly told the police about Watts, who was charged under an \"abuse of a corpse\" statute. Her case falls out of the range of the Pregnancy Justice report.\n\nPregnancy Justice found that more than half of the cases involved information obtained in a medical setting. In a separate 2023 study of the criminalization of self-managed abortion between 2000 and 2020, the reproductive justice group If/When/How found that in 45% of cases, it was healthcare providers or social workers who had tipped off police to a suspected self-managed abortion.\n\n\"This is a significant phenomenon, and now we have people all over the country hiding real healthcare needs and not reaching out for help. That's the effect of this,\" Bach said. \"I would like a society in which people who need care, seek care. But if this is what's going to happen, then it is totally rational to not seek care.\"\n\nFor Pregnancy Justice, the link between prosecutions and the medical establishment raises questions about the post-Roe surveillance of pregnancy - in particular, how the CDC, which already tracks nationwide information about abortion, could expand its reach.\n\nProject 2025, a playbook of policies for a future conservative administration drafted by the influential thinktank the Heritage Foundation, suggests that the CDC force every state to report the number of abortions it performs, as well as abortion complications, miscarriages, stillbirths and \"treatments that incidentally result in the death of a child (such as chemotherapy)\". Bach and Earle declined to discuss the Project 2025 proposal, citing Pregnancy Justice's nonprofit status.\n\nThe findings released on Tuesday are preliminary; Pregnancy Justice researchers intend to conclude the study in two years.\n\n\"Every day, as the research continues,\" Bach said, \"we discover more evidence of this and the harder we look, the more we find.\""

      "text": "Anger, fear and desperation: people reflect on two years since fall of Roe\n\nThe Dobbs decision has forced patients to travel out of their state to access abortion care, others have carried unwanted pregnancies, while for some it was a call to action\n\nAfter Roe v Wade was overturned in June 2022, Daphne did not want to leave anything to chance.\n\nAbortion is currently legal until 18 weeks in Utah, where the 38-year-old lives - but the state has a 2020 trigger law banning almost all abortion care that is currently under appeal.\n\nDaphne knew she didn't want children so she decided to undergo surgical sterilization in October 2022, to have \"peace of mind that [she] physically cannot become pregnant\".\n\n\"My husband could have gotten a vasectomy for less money and an easier recovery time. However, that doesn't change the outcome if I were to be assaulted. Living in Utah, I could not and would not risk having to seek an abortion, likely having to leave the state to do so, after an already traumatic event,\" Daphne said.\n\nThe procedure, which was not fully covered by her health insurance, left her around $1,000 out of pocket.\n\n\"I'm lucky I was able to take these measures, and most cannot,\" she added.\n\nAlmost two years after the supreme court decided there is no constitutional right to abortion in the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization case, patients have increasingly been forced to travel out of their state in order to access abortion care, while others have carried unwanted pregnancies to term. A study earlier published in January estimated there have been nearly 65,000 pregnancies from rape in states with abortion bans.\n\nInterstate travel for abortion care in the US doubled between 2020 and 2023 , from one in 10 to almost one in five people leaving their state to access treatment, data from the Guttmacher Institute shows.\n\nIn states where it is possible, many go to neighboring states. Hanz, a 30-year-old who works as a clinical social worker in an abortion clinic in Illinois, but lives in Missouri, found out they were pregnant in late July 2022, they recalled: \"As soon as I saw the two lines on the test, I knew I had more rights standing in Illinois than I would when I got home that night. Abortion rights had already got so much worse in recent years - and then Roe was overturned.\" (Missouri passed a trigger law in 2019 that banned abortions except in medical emergencies.)\n\nHanz wanted a child, but felt it wasn't the right time. \"I was really weighing what I wanted and what felt like the right decision. It was very hard for me to terminate the pregnancy, but I had a difficult time growing up and didn't feel I could bring a child into the world and not be able to give them the quality of life I wanted to,\" they said.\n\nAfter spending a month carefully weighing their options, they crossed into Illinois to terminate the pregnancy at the beginning of September at nine weeks.\n\n\"Making the decision was much harder than having the actual abortion,\" Hanz said, adding that fears remain about crossing the border to receive care.\n\n\"I've talked to people who thought they may be arrested when they returned to their home state - you're not breaking the law by crossing the state,\" Hanz said.\n\nFor others, the introduction of abortion restrictions has meant they are not having children they may have had. Over the last few years, Brie, 41, had been considering having another child - but after Dobbs, she felt she could not undergo the risk of a pregnancy at her age in the state of Texas.\n\n\"My husband and I had dreamt of a third child. Now, I know it's definitely not going to happen,\" Brie said, adding that she felt she could not risk a pregnancy in Texas, which has a near-total abortion ban .\n\nHer medical history adds to her fears: she had a complicated first pregnancy, including experiencing pre-eclampsia, and needed an emergency C-section.\n\n\"It was scary and dangerous,\" she said. \"With my history, there's no way I'd trust having this pregnancy in Texas or the south. I'd have to move.\"\n\nThe loss of the constitutional right to abortion has taken the choice out of her hands, she feels. \"Our seven-year-old son is asking for a younger sibling,\" Brie said. \"I know I'm in a privileged position - we have two wonderful, healthy kids - but I don't appreciate the state making my family planning decisions.\"\n\nAbortion is an issue that divides her family. \"The last two years have been a very volatile time, even having these discussions within my extended family,\" she said. The issue is at odds with other values prized in Texas, she believes: \"People here are very concerned with freedom. But there's this huge conflict here between concern with personal freedom, and the approach to women and fertility. The only acceptable carveout is women that are pregnant.\"\n\nEvery month, she feels anxious about the chance of pregnancy. \"It's constantly on my mind and has been since Dobbs: am I going to be thrown under the bus by my state this month?\n\n\"You play scenarios out, what if, where would I go, who would I tell. It's a big wall of separation between who could you trust. I think that's the goal: to isolate and put women in a position of insecurity.\"\n\nFor some, the fall of Roe was a call to action. Paul, in his mid-50s and living in North Carolina, knew little about abortion rights when he heard the news two years ago.\n\n\"Up until then, it was not something I cared about - it was obvious that women should have the right to choose,\" he said. He had thought abortion was a \"settled issue\".\n\nWhen he heard the news, he remembers that he and his wife \"stared at each other in silence, and thought, what the hell happens next? It doesn't affect us personally, but it does affect millions of women. I went in completely blind.\"\n\nCompelled by a need to take action, by November 2022, Paul had begun volunteering with a group that offered logistical assistance to people requiring abortions, often picking up patients who had travelled from states with more restrictive laws and driving them to clinics.\n\n\"I've driven young teens with their parents who are absolutely petrified; women in their 20s who accept it's something they have to do, and others to whom it's no big deal. Everyone has a different set of circumstances - you don't have to explain your reason to me,\" he said.\n\nAfter North Carolina reduced the limit from 20 to 12 weeks in May 2023 , the number of patients traveling to the state dwindled until the service disbanded. Now, Paul volunteers most weeks as a clinic escort.\n\n\"More Saturdays than not, I can be found wearing a rainbow-striped vest, shielding women behind umbrellas as I walk them into the clinic. I have been called a murderer, a baby killer ... And I'll happily do it again next weekend as well,\" he said. \"A lot of men don't want to acknowledge that men have a role to play in fixing this - it's not up to just women.\"\n\nFor Jane*, a woman from Texas in her 60s, the writing was on the wall before Dobbs as she watched restrictions chip away at abortion rights year after year. Between 1973 and May 2022, 1,380 abortion restrictions were enacted in states, according to the Guttmacher Institute , with more than 630 of these enacted since 2011.\n\nJane became involved in direct action in 2018, driving people in need of abortion to appointments: \"I became involved because I realised pro-choice is just that - it doesn't address access. It's a limited way at looking at reproductive justice. Seeing the impact of restrictions on abortion, I felt that to do nothing is to be complicit.\"\n\nAfter Texas passed a bill outlawing abortion following the detection of cardiac activity - usually around six weeks - in 2021, Jane was galvanized to take further action. Toward the end of that year, she reached out to Las Libres, a Mexican network that mails pills for self-managed medical abortion.\n\n\"The inhumanity of restrictions just raised my temperature and made me increasingly angry and willing to stick my neck out and do something to help,\" she said. \"Dobbs was the logical next step after increasing regulations permitted under Roe. [Access] was very effectively overturned before Dobbs.\"\n\nJane has been packaging and posting pills to states with abortion bans for the last two years.\n\n\"It is empowering and effective to fight back,\" Jane said. \"Perhaps I am in denial about my own risk, but I have had a good life, I enjoy relative financial stability in my retirement, and who better than me to be in a position to fight back? Small actions matter, and allow me to maintain hope.\"\n\n*Name has been changed"

      "text": "With the end of Roe, the US edges closer and closer to civil war\n\nThe question is no longer whether there will be a civil conflict in America. The question is how the sides will divide, and who will prevail\n\nThe cracks in the foundations of the United States are widening, rapidly and on several fronts. The overturning of Roe v Wade has provoked a legitimacy crisis no matter what your politics.\n\nFor the right, the leaking of the draft memo last month revealed the breakdown of bipartisanship and common purpose within the institution. For the left, it demonstrated the will of dubiously selected Republican justices to overturn established rights that have somewhere near 70% to 80% political support.\n\nAccelerating political violence, like the attack in Buffalo, increasingly blurs the line between the mainstream political conservative movement and outright murderous insanity. The question is no longer whether there will be a civil conflict in the United States. The question is how the sides will divide, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and how those strengths and weaknesses will determine the outcome.\n\nThe right wing has been imagining a civil war, publicly, since at least the Obama administration. Back in 2016, when it looked like Hillary Clinton would win the election, then Kentucky governor Matt Bevin described the possibility in apocalyptic terms: \"The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood. Of who? The tyrants, to be sure. But who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren,\" he told supporters at the Values Voter Summit.\n\nThe possibility of civil war has long been a mainstay of rightwing talk radio. Needless to say, when the right conjures these fantasies of cleansing violence, they tend to fantasize their own victory. Steve King, while still a congressman from Iowa, tweeted an image of red and blue America at war, with the line: \"Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8tn bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use.\"\n\nAny time anyone acts on their violent rhetoric, the rightwing politicians and media elites are appalled that anyone would connect what they say to what others do. \"We need to understand we're under attack, and we need to understand this is 21st-century warfare and get on a war footing,\" Alex Jones said in the lead-up to the Capitol riot.\n\nAccording to a New York Times series, Tucker Carlson has articulated the theory of white replacement more than 400 times on his show. Calls to violence are normal in rightwing media. Calls to resist white replacement are normal in rightwing media. The inevitable result is the violent promotion of resistance to white replacement. Republican politicians like Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers and New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik are outraged when their one plus one turns out to equal two, but their outrage is increasingly unbelievable, even to themselves. America is witnessing a technique used in political struggles all over the world. Movements devoted to the overthrow of elected governments tend to divide into armed and political wings, which gives multiple avenues to approach their goals as well as the cover of plausible deniability for their violence.\n\nThe leftwing American political class, incredibly, continues to cling to its defunct institutional ideals. Democrats under Biden have wasted the past two years on fictions of bipartisanship and forlorn hopes of some kind of restoration of American trust. When violence like Buffalo hits, they can do little more than plead with the other side to reconsider the horror they're unleashing, and offer obvious lectures about the poison of white supremacy. Since January 6 didn't wake them up to exactly what they're facing, it's unclear what might ever wake them up. The left has not made the psychological adjustment to a conflict situation yet. But it won't be able to maintain the fantasy of normalcy for much longer.\n\nThe conflict, which on the surface seems so unequal, with an emboldened and violent right against a demoralized and disorganized left, is not as one-sided as it looks at first. It is unequal but it is also highly asymmetrical. The right has the weaponry and an electoral system weighted overwhelmingly in its favor. The left has money and tech.\n\nSteve King was, in a sense, absolutely correct about the armed status of the two sides. Half of Republicans own a gun, compared with 21% of Democrats. But that gap, though wide, is closing. In 2020, 40% of gun buyers were new buyers. There was a 58% rise in gun sales to African Americans in 2020 over 2019. In 2021, women were nearly half of new gun buyers, an astonishing statistic. The real structural advantage the right possesses is not military but electoral. By 2040, 30% of the country will control 70% of the Senate. The institutions of the US government distinctly favor those who want to destroy it. Every Democrat who fights to end the filibuster is fighting for their own future irrelevance, or rather for the acceleration of their own irrelevance.\n\nTwo essential facts of the 2020 election should give leftwing partisans hope, however. Biden-voting counties amounted to 70% of GDP, while 60% of college-educated voters chose Biden. That is to say, the left-democratic wing of America is the productive and educated part of the country. One way of looking at the American political condition of the moment is that the leftwing part of the US has built the networks that have left behind the rightwing part. The networks are the left's strength.\n\nThe struggle over abortion has already revealed how the divide plays out. Anti-abortion factions control the pseudo-legitimate court system and the poorer states in the Union. Pro-choice factions have responded, first of all, with their superior financial resources. Oregon started the Oregon Reproductive Equity Fund with $15m. New York is establishing a fund to make the state a \"safe haven\". California governor Gavin Newsom plans to add $57m to the state budget to deal with out-of-state patients.\n\nAt the same time, pro-choice organizers are turning to technology. The Atlantic recently reported on networks using \"encrypted, open-source Zoom alternatives\" to provide women with support for their procedures. Already, anonymous web access to self-managed abortions is available, just as it has been for many years in some restrictive jurisdictions.\n\nThis divide isn't just American. As the forces of the world split between a liberal-democratic elite and authoritarian populists, the same asymmetry can be seen in the struggle everywhere. In Canada, the convoy that held the city of Ottawa hostage was defeated, in the end, not by force, but by money and technology. Other countries responded to similar convoys with direct assaults - the French teargassed their convoy immediately and the United States called in the national guard before they had even left for Washington. But in Canada, the government, not wanting to have the blood of children on its hands, weakened the convoy's financial networks by simply turning off their fundraising accounts. A small band of anonymous hackers also tormented the convoy organizers by disrupting their communication lines. They infiltrated their Zello channels, blaring the hardcore gay pornography country anthem Ram Ranch. The \"Ram Ranch Resistance\" almost single-handedly undid the protests at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor.\n\nThis same divide has played out on an international level, in the struggle between Russia and Ukraine. Russia, overwhelmed by resentment because it cannot meaningfully compete in an integrated 21st-century economy, has devolved into a conservative authoritarianism with no other outlet than violence. But Ukraine had better access to the global financial and media networks. The reaction, from the forces of the democratic west, has been to cut Russia off from financial systems and to provide Ukraine with superior technology. Technology and financial networks have proven the match, at the very least, of brute force.\n\nIncipient civil conflict in the United States won't be formal armies struggling for territory. The techniques of both sides are clarifying. Republican officials will use the supreme court, or whatever other political institutions they control, to push their agenda no matter how unpopular with the American people. Meanwhile, their calls for violence, while never direct, create a climate of rage that solidifies into regular physical assaults on their enemies. The technical term for this process is stochastic terrorism; the attack in Buffalo is a textbook example.\n\nThe leftwing resistance is more nascent but is also taking shape: if you're rich and you want to stay living in a democracy, the time has come to pony up. If you're an engineer, the time has come to organize. The conclusion is not at all determined. Neither side has an absolute advantage. Neither side can win easily. But one fact is clear. The battle has been joined, and it will be fought everywhere.\n\nStephen Marche is the author, most recently, of The Next Civil War: Dispatches from the American Future"

      "text": "'The Fall of Roe' Is More Than An Account Of History. It's A Warning About The Future.\n\nContributing Writer\n\nSome people may believe that the end of Roe v. Wade was simply a matter of luck: Following the then-black swan event of Donald Trump winning the 2016 election, Trump got to appoint two Supreme Court Justices in his first two years and a third after an octogenarian passed away weeks before the 2020 election.\n\nThe court then had a 6-3 conservative supermajority, and that was that. But the project to overturn the federal right to abortion was much more calculated, involving an alliance of Republican groups aiming to reshape Congress, the courts and American life. And while conservatives may have won a huge battle, it's not the end of their unholy war.\n\nThat's the story New York Times reporters Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer tell in their new book, \"The Fall of Roe,\" a deeply reported accounting of the machinations of anti-abortion activists and lawmakers to reverse the 1973 ruling that reshaped both society and women's lives. The book recounts the conservative network's past victories, yes, but is also a window into the future, highlighting just how crucial November's elections are for our rights and freedoms.\n\nThat's because if Trump wins a second term, this conservative coalition will bring even more litigation to strip away people's rights - and would likely face a Supreme Court that's even more untouchable than it is now.\n\nThe group most connected to Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe, is Alliance Defending Freedom, a far-right Christian advocacy group. But ADF certainly didn't do it alone, per Dias and Lerer - correspondents on religion and politics, respectively. In many ways, two other organizations laid the groundwork for this victory: The Federalist Society, a judicial group that drafted a list of Trump's Supreme Court nominees, judges Trump said were all opposed to Roe ; and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion political group with an affiliated PAC.\n\nAnd they're all funded with massive amounts of dark money , including from billionaires like the Koch brothers . The 30,000-foot view is that these groups worked together to draft and pass unpopular state laws and have conservative lawyers defend them in front of friendly judges who had been confirmed to lifetime appointments by Republican senators. The network could use this playbook on any number of issues in the future.\n\nADF wrote Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban at issue in the Dobbs litigation. Dias and Lerer report that a conservative Wisconsin lawyer suggested crafting a ban at exactly 15 weeks basically as a dare for abortion rights proponents to challenge it, believing the Supreme Court would find the ban reasonable and gut Roe without fully overturning it.\n\nThe lawyer, Misha Tseytlin, allegedly floated the idea at a Trump victory party hosted by Federalist Society Chair Leonard Leo , and then someone connected to ADF heard it, and the organization had Tseytlin present his theory at a July 2017 ADF summit. (This story shows that conservatives picked 15 weeks not because of emerging medical research, but because abortion rights advocates had chosen not to sue over previous 20-week bans designed to challenge Roe .)\n\nADF drafted a model bill, identified states that might pass it and that had anti-abortion attorneys general who would defend it, and started talking to lobbyists. Then-Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) signed the 15-week ban into law in 2018, and litigation began.\n\nBy the time the Supreme Court was considering taking the case, it was early September 2020. Then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, giving a 5-4 court a 6-3 conservative supermajority, with three Justices appointed by Trump - a president who lost the popular vote. The court agreed to hear the case in May 2021, and the rest is history.\n\nThat playbook worked for striking down Roe , but the coalition is not done. Dias and Lerer write that ADF, in particular, will \"work to restore an understanding of marriage, the family and sexuality that reflects God's creative order.\" First, abortion opponents think Dobbs is not enough; they want a nationwide ban starting at egg fertilization.\n\nADF is involved in two abortion-related Supreme Court cases this term, and Kristen Waggoner, its CEO and general counsel, admitted in March that its lawsuit over the abortion pill , mifepristone, is part of a long-term strategy to restrict abortion at the federal level because Dobbs was never the end goal.\n\nWhat is? A nationwide abortion ban rooted in the view that life begins when an egg is fertilized. \"We believe that human life is precious, that it deserves protection from conception until natural death,\" Waggoner told Politico this past March. \"We believe that the 14th Amendment protects persons and that includes unborn persons, and that the right to life is protected in the Constitution and in our founding document.\"\n\nThe legal theory of personhood from fertilization could also be weaponized against the right to use contraception established in 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut - a precedent Justice Clarence Thomas called on the court to overrule . Though many anti-abortion activists falsely claim that certain methods of birth control are abortions because they prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus, Waggoner chafed at the suggestion that ADF's positions could lead to restrictions on contraception.\n\nShe told Politico that \"ADF has never advocated for limitations on access to contraception\" while later conceding that it's all about how you define abortion and contraception . \"I'm getting uncomfortable with the way you're asking questions, because the mechanism of action for birth control is different depending on what that birth control is,\" she said, per Politico . \"For example, Ella would be considered an abortifacient.\"\n\nElla is emergency contraception , and no credible doctor thinks it causes abortions, yet multiple states are already trying to legally reclassify emergency contraception as abortion. (Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst even explained her vote against the Right to Contraception Act by saying that she introduced a separate bill that doesn't protect emergency contraception .) This is an area to watch in the coming months and years.\n\nBut getting the court to declare fetal personhood might take a while, and a backup plan appears to be trying to resuscitate the Comstock Act of 1873. ADF is arguing in the abortion pill case that the long-dormant anti-vice law means no one can mail abortion pills to other states, even those where abortion is legal.\n\nAnd in arguments, two justices seemed open to the idea . Anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell - the man who wrote the Texas bounty hunter law that nullified Roe months before Dobbs - is working with activist Mark Lee Dickson to pass local ordinances claiming Comstock bans the mailing of abortion pills. And he's deploying the same tactic of pro-bono legal representation that ADF used in Mississippi. Mitchell told The Nation he hopes to get lawsuits over the measures in front of the Supreme Court \"as quickly as possible.\" (Mitchell, I must note, is also litigating a case that gutted minors' access to birth control in Texas.)\n\nADF also has its sights set on reversing the 2015 ruling establishing marriage equality , but Waggoner also seems to resent when journalists ask her about Obergefell v. Hodges . (That ruling was 5-4, and two of the Justices in the majority are no longer on the court - you only need four votes out of nine to take a case.) \"I'm worried you're gonna just use a choice little quote, and anybody that reads the article is going to think I'm abandoning Obergefell , and I am not,\" she told The New Yorker . \"I think it is wrong and it should be reversed, but I don't wake up in the morning thinking about how to do that.\"\n\nThe group wants to roll back transgender rights in employment ( Bostock v. Clayton County , 2020) and expand parental rights ( Troxel v. Granville , 2000) so that parents can override the medical needs of their children with gender dysphoria, The New Yorker reports. ADF is also behind the rash of state laws banning gender-affirming care for minors and trans kids' participation in sports - the group wrote model legislation. W e're watching a redux of the anti-abortion battle plan in real time. \"It's not that the Court is going to say, 'Gender ideology is bad,'\" Waggoner told The New Yorker . \"But I do think the Court could say, 'Parental rights are fundamental rights.'\"\n\nThis far-right Christian coalition is coming for practically every civil right people in the U.S. have gained since the 1960s. It wants to oppress queer people, young people and women, and there are very few obstacles in the way of it getting everything it wants. That's the larger message of \"The Fall of Roe\" - that religious conservatives are extremely organized and see their work as far from over.\n\nThe next president could appoint multiple Supreme Court justices who may be asked to rule on cases challenging the precedents in the crosshairs of ADF, the Federalist Society and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito could retire, cementing a 6-3 court for another generation - or the balance could tip even further to 7-2 should tragedy befall a liberal Justice.\n\nOur freedoms in this country currently depend on the life expectancy of nine unelected people in robes, and the court absolutely needs reforms, including term limits. Keep all the right's larger project in mind when you vote this fall, because this network of groups is counting on people to tune out."

      "text": "Roe v. Wade: Supreme Court Overturns Landmark Ruling Protecting Abortion Rights\n\nCopy Chief, HuffPost\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood on Friday, dismantling the decades-old precedent that protected abortion rights and giving states the go-ahead to dramatically limit access to reproductive health care.\n\nThe ruling in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case, written by Justice Samuel Alito, was not a surprise. A draft ruling was leaked to Politico and published in early May ; the final ruling hews closely to the leaked draft.\n\n\"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" Alito wrote for the majority. \"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely-the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\"That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" and \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" Alito continued.\n\nAbortion is not \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,\" according to Alito, and, therefore, not protected as a right.\n\nAlito was joined in his decision by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate concurrence, while the liberal minority of Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor filed a joint dissent.\n\nThe hard-line conservative ruling will now go nationwide, allowing states to implement strict abortion restrictions that will force some people to continue unwanted and unsafe pregnancies. Victims of rape and incest will, in some states, have to go through the traumas of pregnancy, birth and parenthood or adoption. Babies will be born with health conditions they suffer from and even quickly die from. People who aren't prepared or don't want to have children will have to have them anyway.\n\nThe ruling does not end abortion rights entirely. Some states have vowed to protect abortion access and will likely become a safe haven for those seeking the procedure who are able to afford to travel. It's unclear how quickly the 22 states that already have laws limiting abortion will put their bans into effect, but some, including Missouri and Texas, acted quickly to enact their trigger bans in the wake of the ruling. And most state bans restrict abortion only after a certain point in a pregnancy, often with exceptions.\n\nHowever, that's not always the case. In Oklahoma, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill that would prohibit all abortions, except if the life of the pregnant person was in danger or if a rape had been reported to law enforcement. In other states, Republicans are increasingly pushing abortion restrictions that offer no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.\n\nAnd some efforts to enshrine abortion rights have failed. Senate Republicans blocked a bill to codify Roe v. Wade in May. The GOP holds an electoral advantage in many states due to district lines and electoral laws.\n\nThe case came before the court as conservatives sensed momentum when former President Donald Trump, who promised to only appoint conservatives who would overturn Roe v. Wade, appointed three Supreme Court justices. One of those seats was filled by Trump only after Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to allow then-President Barack Obama to appoint a justice to the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia's death in 2016. The die was then cast after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death weeks before the 2020 election allowed Trump to appoint Barrett to give the conservatives a supermajority on the court.\n\nFor this reason, Alito's majority did not need the vote of Roberts, who did not join the other conservative justices and filed a separate concurrence. In his concurrence, Roberts declared that Alito's opinion was wholly unnecessary to decide the case brought by Mississippi.\n\n\"Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis\" Roberts wrote. \"The Court's opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.\"\n\nThe liberal justices' joint dissent notes their \"sorrow\" at the ruling and the pain and hardship it will bring to those now forced to bear children in the states where abortion is now illegal.\n\n\"With sorrow-for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection-we dissent,\" they wrote.\n\nThe liberals also noted that the judicial conservatives are not done stripping Americans of their hard-won rights.\n\n\"[The court's decision] eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women's freedom and equal station,\" the liberal justices wrote. \"It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court's legitimacy.\"\n\nIndeed, Justice Thomas declared in a separate concurrence that the majority opinion excising abortion from protection under the 14th Amendment's due process clause should be applied to the decisions that legalized contraception, same-sex marriage and same-sex sex.\n\n\"[I]n future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nThe deck is stacked against supporters of abortion rights. However, many advocacy groups were already planning next steps ahead of the ruling.\n\nSome are mobilizing to support people seeking abortions by funding travel to and care in states where the procedure remains legal. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington state announced a pact on Friday to allow patients from around the country to access abortion care in their states.\n\nAnother option to protect access is medication abortion, which allows some people seeking to end their pregnancies to do so at home. State-level abortion bans have also targeted medication abortion, but advocates say it's likely more people will obtain the medication and manage their own abortions should bans go into effect.\n\nOn the legislative front, advocates have called for the Senate to end the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation - allowing the minority party to block bills, even if most senators support them. For now, ending the filibuster is unlikely: Two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, oppose ending it. Even if they changed their minds, Democrats likely only have 49 votes in favor of codifying Roe. In the most recent vote, Manchin sided with Republicans to block the bill.\n\nOn Friday, Manchin lamented that he had \"trusted\" Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, both of whom he voted to confirm, when they suggested they would not overturn Roe v. Wade. He added that he supports \"legislation that would codify the rights Roe v. Wade previously protected\" and hopes the two parties will work together on such a bill.\n\nBut most Republicans ― save similarly disappointed lawmakers like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine ― are not interested in codifying abortion rights. On Friday, Republicans cheered the decision and indicated their next aim is to ban abortion across the country .\n\nPresident Joe Biden vowed on Friday to fight to protect abortion access, including by directing officials to ensure broader access to abortion pills and to protect people's ability to travel to seek an abortion.\n\nBut he said that actually codifying abortion rights into law would take Congress ― meaning voters need to expand Democratic majorities.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "What's Up With The 17% Of Voters Who Blame Biden For The Fall Of Roe v. Wade?\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nNearly 20% of voters blame President Joe Biden for the Supreme Court's decision to repeal Roe v. Wade in 2022, according to a poll released Monday ― even though former President Donald Trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning Roe, given that he appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who were central to the decision.\n\nThe survey, conducted by The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer, found that 17% of registered voters in six swing states believe Biden has \"a lot of responsibility\" or \"some responsibility\" for ending the constitutional right to abortion. Just over 55% of respondents said Trump has \"some responsibility\" or \"a lot of responsibility\" for overturning Roe.\n\nAbortion has been a weak spot for Trump, who up until recently has dodged questions on the issue. Since Roe fell and nearly 20 states enacted abortion bans or restrictions, abortion has become a powerful campaign weapon for Democrats and a vulnerability for Republicans.\n\nThe 17% figure yielded in the Times/Siena/Inquirer poll doesn't reflect what Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, is hearing on the ground while canvassing for abortion rights in some of these states.\n\n\"The data and evidence, particularly in Trump's own words, is extremely compelling... and we've just gotta get more folks paying attention,\" she said. \"That doesn't tend to happen until later in the summer, early into the fall.\"\n\nThe finding is a stark contrast to some of the other numbers from the poll. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said abortion should be \"always legal,\" and 49% said Biden would do a better job on abortion than Trump. Another recent survey from Navigator, a polling group focused on progressive issues, found that the public is growing more aware of Trump's anti-abortion record. The more voters hear from Trump, the more likely they are to believe he will sign a national abortion ban if elected.\n\nChristina Reynolds, senior vice president of communications at EMILY's List, wasn't too worried about the 17%, reasoning that it's a small number and the other findings about abortion access are generally in line with what the abortion rights group has heard from pro-choice voters.\n\n\"The idea that some percentage blames Biden, it may be that that's a percentage that's just gonna blame Biden for anything,\" Reynolds said. \"It may be that that's a group of people who just know that it happened while Biden was president and haven't focused on that specific issue very much.\"\n\nThe 17% of respondents consisted largely of young voters who did not vote in the last election. Abortion is \"incredibly salient\" to young voters and young voters of color, said Timmaraju, who sees this as an opportunity for the Biden campaign.\n\n\"We knew we were going to have to keep reminding voters who was responsible for the crisis and who can fix it,\" she said. \"Trump's vote is locked in, Biden has a lot of opportunity. We've known all along, as advocacy groups that have endorsed Biden and [Vice President Kamala] Harris, we have a lot of work to do to make sure voters understand not only what the Biden-Harris record is, but what they're going to do when we return them to the White House.\"\n\nGeoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, agreed that many voters are not dialed in to the election yet.\n\n\"The reality is that many voters are not paying close attention to the election and have not started making up their minds ― a dynamic also reflected in today's poll,\" Garin said in a statement shared via a Biden spokesperson. \"These voters will decide this election and only the Biden campaign is doing the work to win them over.\" He added that broad conclusions about the presidential race should not be drawn based on the results of just one poll.\n\nThe poll shows that Trump is leading in five of the six battleground states surveyed. The decrease in support for Biden is among young voters and voters of color who are frustrated with how the president has handled the economy and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\" You'll see us out there in the press... talking about this and raising this issue,\" Reynolds said, \"and by election day voters won't be confused about who's to blame.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "How TV Shows Tackled The End Of Roe v. Wade This Year - And What They Got Wrong\n\nSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nFrom characters having to go to another state to access abortion care to an episode of \"Law & Order\" featuring \"the first ever depiction of an abortion fund volunteer,\" many shows on TV incorporated stories showing the repercussions of the U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade this year. But as a new report released Thursday lays out, they often produced mixed results and did it in misguided ways that don't accurately reflect the wide range of abortion stories in America.\n\nFor the past decade, researcher Steph Herold and her team at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) at the University of California, San Francisco, have collected and studied abortion storylines in pop culture , whether it's a character having an abortion, disclosing a past abortion and/or considering getting an abortion.\n\nMore TV shows in 2022 began depicting the legal, financial and logistical barriers to abortion access, according to her newest report. TV characters encountered obstacles like having to drive long distances to reach an abortion provider, needing to raise money to pay for the abortion and having trouble taking time off from work or finding child care. But for Herold, who for years has pointed out the lack of TV storylines that reflected the difficulties of accessing abortion, this shift has been \"too little, too late.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Dobbs decision was a big wake-up call for a lot of people,\" she said in an interview, referring to the Mississippi abortion access case that triggered the reversal of Roe. \"I think that there are a lot of writers, showrunners - and, hopefully, producers and networks - who are now here to take a little bit more risk in the service of telling some of these stories.\"\n\nThe year 2022 marked an all-time high in TV storylines about abortion since she and her team began collecting this data . There were at least 60 abortion-related plots or mentions on 52 TV shows - an increase from last year , when there were 47 abortion-related plots on 42 shows. It's a huge change from even just a few years ago: In 2016, they found only 13 abortion-related stories on major scripted shows in the U.S.\n\nBut shows are still repeating many of the same tropes. Chief among them is that, demographically, TV shows still don't reflect who is most likely to face barriers to abortion access, a trend Herold has long documented. Most TV protagonists getting abortions are still \"young, white, wealthy characters,\" which Herold thinks is a product of Hollywood's risk aversion and what executives think will make money.\n\n\"I think there's this presumption that the story that audiences want to see, if they want to see stories about abortion at all, is about this, like, attractive, young, wealthy white woman - although the reality is, I think audiences really deserve a lot more credit. Most want to see all kinds of different stories represented on TV,\" she said. \"Of course, at the top of it all is capitalism and white supremacy. ... Even though writers' rooms are diversifying, that's not trickling up to the networks. People who are ultimately making the decisions are a lot of the older white men or older white women who are cutting those stories that could really break boundaries and could tell some of the stories that we keep saying we want to see.\"\n\nAccording to Herold's report, only eight abortion plotlines (or 23%) involved Black characters - an improvement from previous years but still not reflective of the reality of abortion in America, where about 33% of abortion patients are Black. And about 60% of people seeking abortions are already parents, a storyline that's not often depicted on television. As the report notes: \"This continues to erase the very common experience of parents who obtain abortions, and perpetuates the false dichotomy between raising children and having abortions.\"\n\nThere's still a relative lack of everyday abortion experiences on TV, especially on legal and medical procedurals, which often create stories out of exceptional, \"ripped from the headlines\" circumstances for maximum dramatic effect. This season of ABC's long-running medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" (which has often admirably featured abortion, including in times when many shows would not go there ) featured two episodes exploring the effects of the Supreme Court decision last summer. As Herold explained, each episode did a few things well - but also reinforced several inaccurate tropes (among them: both characters seeking abortions are white).\n\nIn an episode in October, Dr. Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) instructs a teenager on how to safely take pills for a medication abortion. \"Our research has shown that that kind of information can increase people's knowledge about medication abortion, especially coming from a doctor character, so that's great,\" Herold said. \"But in terms of helping people understand who gets abortions, why they get abortions, developing empathy, having a one-off character there for a few minutes is really not going to do that. You need it to be a character who people have a relationship with over many episodes or a season.\"\n\nA few episodes later, Bailey and Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) are treating a pregnant woman from Idaho who had to travel across the border to Washington to receive an abortion for an ectopic pregnancy. But while the three are stuck in traffic, she bleeds to death.\n\n\"It's like this white character who is just this victim and is not having an abortion for the much, much, much more common reasons that people have abortions. Like, they can't afford to have another child, or they don't want to raise a child with the partner that they have right now or that they don't want to be pregnant at this time at all - all of those reasons that are less dramatic, which is why we don't see them on TV.\"\n\nHerold gets that shows like \"Grey's\" often \"heighten the drama,\" which results in these extreme scenarios. \"The problem is that people have so little information about abortion that they often see these kinds of portrayals and they think, like, 'Oh, OK, that might be how it happens in real life.' Like, if you see a car crash on TV, you have enough information most likely to say, 'OK, I know driving is actually safe. That probably won't happen as long as I do X, Y, Z.' But most people don't have that kind of counterfactual [for abortion]. And they might not think, like, 'Oh, a lot of other people are suffering, not just this suburban mom who has an ectopic pregnancy.' Actually, millions of people now can't get the abortions they need, not just people with ectopic pregnancies,\" Herold said. \"I get why they did that: it's very dramatic to have a fallopian tube burst on the side of the road. I just hope we see more and more everyday types of abortion scenes, too.\"\n\nOne of the best shows in 2022 that thoughtfully incorporated abortion into its plot was Starz's \"P-Valley,\" created by Katori Hall, who had long wanted to write an episode exploring Mississippi's restrictive abortion laws. Herold said she appreciated that the show meaningfully explored the relationship between Mercedes (Brandee Evans) and her daughter Terricka (A'zaria Carter) as the daughter weighed whether to get an abortion and that the storyline centered low-income Black women without being exploitative.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the success of shows and stories like that will help motivate others to not just tell stories but greenlight stories that people already really want to share,\" Herold said. But she worries about the current wave of economic cuts in Hollywood. In times of economic contraction, executives often disproportionately mute underrepresented voices and revert to greenlighting stories they deem as less risky, which could set back progress on representation.\n\nIn an ideal world, Herold would love to see more shows across genres and time periods incorporate abortion in substantive ways - or even \"a writers' room full of people who've had abortions.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Backlash To Losing Roe v. Wade Is Just Getting Started\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThe end of national abortion rights threw a wrench in Republican plans for a \"red wave\" in the midterm elections by turning the advantages of running against an unpopular president's party on their head.\n\nThe biggest policy change of President Joe Biden's first term wasn't passed by Congress nor signed by the president. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which in June overturned the abortion rights precedent set in 1973 in Roe v. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court's Republican-appointed conservatives asserted themselves, and the party that put them on the bench as counter-incumbents to Biden. Their woefully unpopular decision - consistently opposed by at least 60% of Americans across most polls - energized Democratic Party voters when backers of the current president's party usually are less engaged. It not only helped limit Republicans to a maximum net gain of nine seats in the U.S. House but also helped Democrats maintain Senate control and win crucial state-level races for governor and state legislature seats in more traditionally conservative states such as Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd just as the court's Roe v. Wade ruling worked to disassemble the interests and factions that made up Democrats' New Deal coalition, so too will Dobbs continue to tear at the seams of the GOP coalition for elections to come.\n\nThe first sign that Dobbs had changed the 2022 election dynamic came when Republican-heavy Kansas voted down an anti-abortion initiative in August. A string of Democratic overperformances in House special elections followed the Kansas vote, culminating in Democratic wins for Pat Ryan in New York and Mary Peltola in Alaska, who both ran on explicitly pro-abortion rights platforms.\n\nSeeing how the electorate reacted to Dobbs in these races, Democrats made abortion the top attack issue in their midterm campaign with tens of millions of dollars invested in advertising. The goal all along was to energize Democratic voters over abortion rights as a way to blunt the traditional political advantage Republicans would gain as the party not in control of the White House and not presiding over the economic turmoil dragging down Biden's approval rating.\n\nRepublican and Democratic political operatives agree that the Dobbs decision activated Democratic voters and prevented the \"red wave\" that was widely expected, HuffPost reporters Kevin Robillard and Alanna Vagiannos reported.\n\nTwo post-election polls - a TV network exit poll and a Kaiser Family Foundation supplement to the Associated Press's VoteCast survey - back that up, with numbers showing that the Dobbs decision energized key constituencies in support of Democrats and drove crossover Republican voting in key races.\n\nThis is not to say that Dobbs was the sole reason why Democrats performed well in the midterm elections. Other factors, such as the economy's low unemployment rate, the relative popularity of Democrats' policy agenda and the looming presence of former President Donald Trump and his effort to halt the peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 6, 2021, also aided Democrats and hampered Republicans. Many of the candidates supported by Trump after endorsing his election fraud lies did exceptionally poorly.\n\nBut 40% of all voters and 56% of those who cast a ballot for Democrats said abortion rights had a \"major impact\" on their decision to vote, according to the VoteCast survey. First-time voters (54%), young voters under 30 (52%), women under 50 (51%) and \"those who said they were angry about the Supreme Court decision\" (63%) were among the groups with the highest share saying the issue of abortion drove their decision to vote in 2022.\n\nAmong the 25% of voters who told VoteCast that abortion was the \"single most important factor\" in their vote, 70% cast their ballots for Democratic candidates. These voters included Republicans who crossed over to vote for Democratic candidates in five swing states studied by VoteCast. One out of five Republicans in Arizona and Pennsylvania who said the end of Roe was the most important factor in their vote cast their ballot for Democratic candidates. Around 1 in 10 GOP voters animated by the Dobbs decision voted for Democrats in Georgia and Wisconsin.\n\nSimilarly, significant percentages of Republicans said they were angry about the court's decision to overturn Roe and supported abortion rights in the TV network exit poll . One-quarter of the poll's respondents said abortion should be legal were Republicans. Among the 39% of respondents who said that the end of Roe made them angry, 14% were Republicans. And among the 53% of respondents who trusted Democrats to handle the issue of abortion, 13% were Republicans.\n\nThis follows the consistent findings in Gallup's polling that around one-quarter of Republicans say they support a woman's right to choose. This significant chunk of registered Republicans could be motivated to oppose their party over the abortion issue in upcoming elections, particularly if congressional Republicans continue to push for a national abortion ban or as red states embrace ever more draconian restrictions.\n\nThe state-level policy already appears to have driven - or depressed - voter turnout in some areas, according to The New York Times . Democrats did worse in states such as California and New York, where abortion rights were protected, and did better in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where abortion was on the ballot. There are some reasons to doubt this is a controlling explanation: Democrats may have done even worse in California and New York for various other reasons. Also, Democrats performed as poorly as the traditional political wisdom said they should in Florida, where Republicans have a free hand to restrict abortion access further.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising to see an uneven or slow political effect from a major Supreme Court decision like Dobbs. It took multiple election cycles for Republicans to capitalize on the court's decision in Roe, which was unpopular when it was decided, and build a new majority coalition with crossover voting from Catholics and Southern protestant evangelicals. This culminated with Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential win and his dominating of the 1984 reelection campaign - the most recent blowout presidential victory - and continued with the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994.\n\nGOP-led attacks on Roe succeeded in building a new coalition because the abortion issue \"helped to redefine the scope of conflict in society,\" political scientists Dave Bridge and Curt Nichols argue , by connecting the perceived attack on traditional values by a liberal court to the anti-government sentiments expressed by free market libertarians and civil rights opponents.\n\nThe same can be said of Dobbs and the other major issue that dragged on Republicans in the midterms: democracy. The predominant concern put before voters about democracy is that in embracing Trump and his anti-majoritarian political success, the Republican Party is working to secure permanent power without having to win most of the votes. In the worst-case scenario, this could involve a successful legal overthrow of an elected government, as Trump tried in 2021 and the candidates he endorsed in 2022 promised. (All of those candidates lost.)\n\nThe abortion and democracy issues overlap in three ways, political scientist Julia Azari argued in a pre-election piece for Grid . First, Azari points to an analysis of voter attitudes on abortion by Meredith Conroy and Amelia Thomson-Deveaux at FiveThirtyEight that notes that support and opposition to abortion rights are more about questions of power than fetal viability or the question of when life begins:\n\n\"If you dig into the polling and research, it becomes clear that the divide is less about people's individual genders than the way they think about gender. People who believe in traditional gender roles - and perceive that those roles are increasingly being blurred to men's disadvantage - are much likelier to oppose abortion than people who don't hold those beliefs.\n\nThe dividing lines of the abortion debate aren't just about the morality of terminating a pregnancy. They're also about views of power. Who has it? Who doesn't? And who should?\"\n\nAs Azari notes, the exercise of power is exactly what Americans see when women and girls need to flee their home states to obtain medical care, state GOP politicians retaliate against medical providers for talking to the press about local bans on abortion and statements by Republican politicians, such as Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania or Bo Hines in North Carolina, that abortion care should be decided, in part, by politicians.\n\nSecond, those concerns about power also apply to the Supreme Court itself. As the lone unelected branch of the federal government, the court is the least democratic of the three. And attacking the court as an unelected bench of politicians in robes is a tried-and-true attack by any who dislike its decisions. But this particular court is even less democratic than past courts.\n\nTrump's appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett handed Republicans the supermajority they needed to overturn Roe. These three pivotal justices also happen to be the only justices in American history appointed by both a president who lost the popular vote and confirmed by the votes of senators representing a minority of the U.S. population. The only other justices in history similarly confirmed by senators representing a minority of the American electorate, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, are also on the court. These are the five justices who voted to overturn Roe.\n\nAnd third, there is the issue of state's rights. In Alito's decision in Dobbs, he declared that by overturning Roe, the court would \" return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives\" in the states. But Republicans have so heavily gerrymandered some states - Ohio and Wisconsin , for example - that the people living there cannot achieve representative government to enact their actual preferences. Instead, they must live with abortion bans that they do not support.\n\nThe Dobbs decision itself is a product of the problem the current anti-majoritarian Republican Party presents for the American democratic tradition. And none of these concerns are going to leave the political stage any time soon.\n\nEvery week brings a new fresh horror of a woman or girl denied medical care due to the abortion bans enacted in the wake of Dobbs. The most recent story is about a Washington, D.C., woman who nearly died after a hospital in Ohio, which bans abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy, refused to treat her miscarriage and sent her home, where she almost bled out in a bathtub. These stories will not stop.\n\nNor will efforts to impose more stringent and punitive abortion bans. From its founding, the anti-abortion movement has had one goal: banning abortion nationwide. Anti-abortion groups like Right to Life and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America are promoting Tennessee's extremely punitive abortion ban as a model for other states and the nation, according to ProPublica .\n\nThe 2024 GOP presidential primary will also put the issue front and center as anti-abortion groups have already made support for a nationwide abortion ban a litmus test for their support.\n\n\"In this new Dobbs era, some in the GOP have suggested this is an issue solely for the states to decide and that Congress and the president have no role,\" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in a press release following Trump's announcement of his third bid for the White House on Tuesday. \"This amounts to a death sentence to unborn babies in blue states that allow abortion on demand until birth, such as California, Illinois and New York. It is an unacceptable position for any 2024 GOP presidential contender to hold.\"\n\nEven if Republicans wanted to sweep their support for an unpopular abortion ban under the rug, Democrats would not let them. Calling Trump a \"failure as a president,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison said in a statement after Trump's announcement that \"Democrats stand ready to remind Americans what Trump brought America,\" including \"the right-wing Supreme Court that overturned Roe and paved the way for extreme Republicans across the country to criminalize abortion.\"\n\nAbortion rights groups and Democratic politicians are also likely to look at their success in ballot measure campaigns in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont in 2022 as a way to spur turnout in 2024 and beyond. States that allow ballot measures include those where Democrats will be defending their Senate majority in 2024, including Arizona, Montana, Nevada and Ohio.\n\nThe political fallout from Dobbs is just getting started. Just as the anti-abortion forces that came together following Roe did not solely affect the elections immediately following the decision, the forces fighting back against Dobbs will continue to alter the political landscape as they seek to reclaim the right that the court's conservatives stripped from them."

      "text": "I Work At A Women's Clinic In Post-Roe America. This Is What I Wish Every Teenager Knew.\n\nGuest Writer\n\nI was in the clinic the day Roe v. Wade was overturned. I was either inserting an IUD, treating another case of chlamydia or ordering breast imaging after finding a nut-like lump during a routine breast exam. Perhaps I had just finished counseling a woman about what to expect after taking her medical abortion pills.\n\nEven though the entire staff at my nonprofit feminist health center in Chico, California, knew this was coming, the news still hit like a blow. I had spent 26 years of my life dedicated to empowering women about their health and reproduction, and in one terrible decision, the Supreme Court sent the rights of women in America about 70 years backward.\n\nI became a contraception expert almost by accident. I am a certified nurse-midwife, and in 2017, after years of providing home birth midwifery care, I decided to try a clinic job. Delivering babies as a solo home-birth midwife is one of the most meaningful things a person can do for a living. Midwives are honored to be present at life's greatest and most intimate transformations. But the work also involves getting called out of bed in the middle of the night, strings of lost nights of sleep and high-stakes stress when unexpected complications arise. Not to mention always being on-call. I was ready for a change. One of the benefits of a career in nursing is that you can work in many different capacities and settings yet stay within your profession.\n\nWhen I took the position at Women's Health Specialists, I found that my own reasons for going into women's health were perfectly aligned with the clinic's mission: \"Working toward a world where women control their own bodies, reproduction and sexuality.\" The clinic is dedicated to providing women-controlled health care and advocating for all options for all women, with the understanding that only with dignity and freedom of choice can women achieve their full potential. I felt like I was home.\n\nCompared to attending births, my role as clinician here initially seemed easy, with daytime hours and a set schedule. The patient visits I conducted were \"basic\" for someone with my level of training and experience. They included help with contraception and sexually transmitted infections, general gynecological care for mostly teens and college students, counseling on pregnancy options, and medical abortion.\n\nI would soon discover that my patients needed so much more than basic clinical care. For one thing, anyone who came through our doors would be seen, regardless of ability to pay. We saw young, old, people who were unhoused and years behind on regular health care maintenance, and undocumented immigrants afraid to go anywhere else. Our waiting rooms were lively and colorful, with all genders and sexual orientations and different crowds that comprised our college town and the surrounding farming communities. Everyone knew that for sexual health needs, our clinic was the place to go.\n\nClinic days were hectic because I would often see 35 or more patients in a day. When I walked into an exam room, I had 15 minutes face-to-face with a person, and that often included a physical exam. I saw my work as a privilege and a responsibility, and I wanted to make each visit a meaningful interaction for the patient. This meant really listening to them and giving counsel that was accurate and nonjudgmental. I wanted my patients to leave the clinic feeling better about themselves than when they came in.\n\nThen there was the fact of the world dramatically changing outside our clinic walls.\n\nDonald Trump was inaugurated as president three weeks after I started my job, and with his ascent came immediate threats to women's rights and autonomy. That is when we saw a massive uptick in teenagers getting IUDs. They wanted to have contraception that would last his whole presidency, just in case. I will never forget the first 14-year-old I helped to get an IUD. She was so brave and happy about it, having made that choice for herself.\n\nTwo years of pussy hats and women's marches later, on Nov. 8, 2018, our neighboring town of Paradise burned down in a single, historically destructive day. Thirty thousand people lost their homes in the Camp fire. We stayed open extra hours for days afterward, our clinic blanketed in apocalyptic black smoke, daylight reduced to a dim red haze, so that hundreds of people could replace birth control that had been lost in the fire. Even still, there was a huge surge of unintended pregnancies in the fire's aftermath.\n\nAnd then came the pandemic. We never closed our doors, not even for a single day ― because guess what people locked down at home do more of? Everyone and their aunties got urinary tract infections or needed birth control. Our community saw a rise in syphilis cases during the COVID years, which we called the Second Epidemic. Our services were essential, and to continue providing them, we risked bringing the deadly new infection home to our families. I was proud to be a pilot provider of telehealth medical abortion. The data from our clinic's pilot program during COVID helped determine that telehealth abortion is safe so that this service can now be scaled up to serve people in states with bans on physical abortions.\n\nPeople seeking our care were often in trouble and needing serious help. Perhaps they were a victim of sexual assault or had been betrayed by a partner and left with both a pregnancy and an STI. People came in with multiple concurrent STIs, or a breast mass or a lump in their ovary the size of a cabbage. A woman came in bleeding from what turned out to be a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. I had never seen one before, but I swiftly diagnosed it, saving her life.\n\nThere would also be hundreds of routine visits ― injection after injection of Depo-Provera birth control, contraceptive pill prescription after prescription, and complaint after complaint of \"funky discharge,\" the hallmark of vaginitis. I counseled patients about the same topics day in and day out ― safe sex, how to use each birth control method correctly and the care of one's vagina. I became skillful at addressing delicate personal and sexual issues that are cloaked by our culture in stigma and shame. I shared as much information as I could stuff into each encounter so that women would leave a little more empowered to take care of themselves. I often thought that I should put all of this in a book.\n\nAs an expert in all things contraception and reproduction, I also felt I had a responsibility to help young people during the transition to a post-Roe America. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to the consequences of unintended pregnancy. Around the country, they now face abortion bans and care deserts, fake clinics and misinformation circulating on the web. These are all barriers to reproductive autonomy. I decided to write \"It's Your Body: The Young Woman's Guide to Empowered Sexual Health\" because everyone has the right to decide whether, when and with whom they have a baby.\n\nAs fall approaches, the Center for Reproductive Rights reports that 6 million college students are heading to campuses in abortion-restricted states. Fifty-five percent of them are female. Abortion care is now fully illegal in 14 states, many of which have historic and large universities, including Florida, Texas, Georgia and Indiana. Young people are the hardest hit by abortion bans as they are the least likely to have the resources required to travel out of state for help. The consequences of being denied abortion care as a student have been found to lead to an incomplete education, falling into and remaining in poverty, and the increased likelihood of experiencing domestic violence. This is a public health crisis for the young women of America.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Is This The Last Anniversary Of Roe v. Wade?\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThis weekend marks the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision that protects the right to abortion . It could be the last time reproductive rights advocates celebrate the anniversary of Roe - next year, they might be looking back at the law in memoriam.\n\nThe upcoming Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization weighs heavily on this year's anniversary, which falls on Saturday . The case centers around a Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy - a direct contradiction to Roe, which made it a constitutional right to access abortion until a fetus becomes viable at around 24 weeks. The Mississippi law cuts that almost in half.\n\nThe Supreme Court could strike down the law, which means Roe would remain intact. But advocates and experts agree that during oral arguments last month, the court's conservative majority signaled that it would likely uphold the law by either banning abortion outright or tinkering with the viability line. Either of those options would effectively overturn Roe - setting off a nationwide battle where some states outlaw abortion and others go to great lengths to protect it.\n\n\"I'm not sure it has hit people in this country that we are on the precipice of the court overturning 50 years of naming and reaffirming that Roe is the law of the land, that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is one tied up with your very liberty,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center , told HuffPost on a press call last week. \"I'm not sure the public fully understands what's at stake, but on this Roe Day, it is hitting all of us extremely hard that it could be the last.\"\n\nThe decision in the Mississippi case is not expected until June, but the battle for abortion rights is already underway on the state level.\n\nA handful of pro-choice lawmakers have passed or are working to pass abortion protections in their states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced just days after Mississippi's oral arguments that he planned to make his state a \"sanctuary\" for people seeking reproductive care by paying for travel, lodging and abortion procedures for those coming from out of state.\n\nEarlier this month, New Jersey passed a law that codifies protections for reproductive freedom and expands the definition of who is legally allowed to provide abortion care to include midwives and advanced practice nurses.\n\n\"The United States Supreme Court is preparing to take a wrecking ball to its own precedent Roe v. Wade, and that would also demolish our case-law-based foundation here in New Jersey,\" Gov. Phil Murphy (D) said at the public signing of the bill. \"Neither I nor those with me today can let that happen.\"\n\nAt least 15 states and Washington, D.C., have laws that explicitly protect the right to abortion, including Maine, New York, Nevada and Washington state. States such as Delaware and New Mexico have repealed pre-Roe abortion bans as a sign that they will protect reproductive rights if Roe falls. Colorado and Virginia have improved abortion coverage in health insurance plans , while Hawaii expanded the definition of who can provide abortion care, similar to New Jersey's recent move.\n\nMany advocates in abortion care are well aware that this might be the last Roe Day where the movement is actively fighting to protect the ruling. Next year, they could be working in a very different landscape.\n\n\"We need to watch and listen to the people who are leading the fight for abortion when they tell you that this law that may seem small is actually going to affect a lot of people,\" Lindsay Rodriguez, communications director for the National Network of Abortion Funds , told HuffPost . \"We can take nothing for granted at this moment. As we move toward this Supreme Court decision, it is critical that there are all hands on deck.\"\n\nTexas' recent abortion ban - which applies after six weeks of pregnancy and deputizes private citizens to enforce it - has given the country a daunting preview of what's to come if Roe falls. Texans seeking abortions are crossing over state lines to access care in another state; bordering states with few resources to begin with are overwhelmed or at capacity trying to accommodate the influx of patients; and those who don't have the ability or resources to travel out of state are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.\n\n\"I'm not sure it has hit people in this country that we are on the precipice of the court overturning 50 years of naming and reaffirming that Roe is the law of the land, that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is one tied up with your very liberty.\"\n\nThe war to overturn Roe v. Wade has always been waged at the state level, and these attacks didn't just pop up overnight. But the attacks have grown in number and severity over the last few years.\n\n\"This is a decadeslong battle that has been waged against abortion access in this country,\" said Destiny Lopez, co-president of All* Above All , a reproductive justice organization . \"We have seen hundreds of attacks almost annually in state legislatures across this country and the attacks have gotten worse, culminating in what we saw in Texas in the fall.\"\n\nLast year, the United States saw the largest wave of state-level bans and restrictions since Roe was decided in 1973. More than 400 anti-abortion measures were introduced, many of which served as test cases for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe in the event that the Mississippi law doesn't do the job. Around 108 of those restrictions were enacted in 19 states.\n\nAt least 21 states are poised to immediately ban or severely restrict access to abortion if Roe falls, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights. A dozen states such as Idaho and Ohio have trigger laws that will immediately ban all or nearly all abortions if Roe is overturned. Four states, including Alabama, West Virginia and Louisiana, have added constitutional amendments declaring that their states do not protect the right to abortion in the event that Roe falls. Eight states still have pre-Roe abortion bans on the books that could once again be enforced in a post-Roe world.\n\nTexas' abortion law accelerated the current environment and galvanized many anti-abortion radicals on the state and federal levels. To date, at least six other states have introduced Texas-style abortion bans and lawmakers from several other states have expressed support for passing similar restrictions.\n\nThe Supreme Court's blessing of the Texas abortion ban last month gave abortion rights advocates even more reason to believe that the high court will not protect Roe in the Dobbs case. The justices ruled that federal court challenges against the ban could proceed, but allowed the six-week ban and the enforcement mechanism to remain in effect during that time.\n\n\"Wherever we go, whether that be in Texas or Nebraska or Ohio or Kentucky or Florida ... we can go anywhere now and say, look, this enforcement mechanism has survived before the Supreme Court of the United States,\" Mark Lee Dickson, the architect of the Texas abortion restriction, said after the Supreme Court made its decision on the ban last month .\n\nBetween the Texas law remaining in effect and the Supreme Court signaling support for extreme restrictions like those in Mississippi and Texas, anti-abortion advocates and lawmakers have been given a signal that they're winning - and that a post-Roe world is just around the corner.\n\nBut the fall of Roe won't only affect abortion care, advocates say. Other civil liberties that are rooted in the 14th Amendment's guarantee of liberty, similar to Roe, could be at risk.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Fall Of Roe v. Wade Is Going To Hurt You In Ways You Can't Foresee\n\nRoe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court case legalizing abortion, has been overturned, and we are grappling with the profound loss of bodily autonomy and personhood that was stolen.\n\nAs a family medicine doctor with a focus on reproductive health, including abortion care, I have been fighting against this outcome for years, and I've already seen a steadily increasing stream of patients who have needed to fly for compassionate abortion care. I'm lucky to live and work in New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul recently signed several laws further codifying and protecting abortion access. Connecticut was the first to pass similar protections, and states like California and Massachusetts are working on legislation. But this is a stark contrast to what Americans in other parts of the country are facing, even though access to high-quality, evidence-based health care should not be based on where you live.\n\nSo let's explore what's coming next, thanks to the fall of Roe: worsening health care disparities, higher maternal mortality rates, criminalization of pregnant people and their doctors, lack of medical care for people experiencing pregnancy complications, attacks on routine medical care for people who can become pregnant, and broad assaults on human rights currently in place for marginalized groups.\n\nTo start, it's important to understand that millions of Americans have already been living in a post-Roe reality. States led by anti-abortion politicians have spent decades making abortion access nearly impossible through targeted regulations of abortion providers, or TRAP laws . They have forced people to drive hours to get care, followed by a visit where doctors are legally obligated to deliver medically inaccurate information. After jumping through those hoops, many states require 24- to 72-hour waiting periods before patients can return to finally get the abortion they need.\n\nIt's easy to see how these barriers are lengthy and expensive. However, lawmakers pretend these obstacles haven't represented an \" undue burden . \" Before Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned Roe, seven states had two or fewer abortion clinics left due to the onslaught of TRAP laws.\n\nWe have already been operating in a system where people with wealth and power are able to end unwanted pregnancies, while marginalized groups, including Black people, Indigenous people, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, children, and people with disabilities, have suffered and will continue to suffer the most due to harsh abortion restrictions. If you are new to abortion advocacy, I encourage you to look to long-standing reproductive justice and advocacy groups ― including SisterSong , the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice , New Voices for Reproductive Justice , the Afiya Center and Shout Your Abortion , among others ― and follow their guidance.\n\nIn 2022 alone, the Supreme Court's decision will directly cause the deaths of hundreds of people as their bodies are used by the state against their will. Abortion is significantly safer than pregnancy ― period. The World Health Organization ranks the United States 57 th in the world for maternal mortality. This rate has increased in past decades , unlike the decline seen in most of the rest of the world. In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. at 23.8 deaths per 100,000 births. Non-Hispanic Black women fared much worse, with a staggering 55.3 deaths per 100,000 births, making them 3.5 times as likely to die as non-Hispanic white women. For comparison, the death rate from abortion in the U.S. between 2013 and 2018 ( the most recent data available ) was 0.41 per 100,000 abortions ― which means abortion is 25 times safer than continuing pregnancy.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision will directly cause the deaths of hundreds of people as their bodies are used by the state against their will.\"\n\nThe politicians banning abortion falsely claim they are protecting women, while having the worst maternal outcomes in the nation. In order, the states with the highest maternal mortality rates are Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri, Texas, South Carolina and Arizona. Notice a pattern? They mandate forced birth, but don't have adequate prenatal care. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana actually argued that maternal mortality rates in his state aren't so bad if you don't count Black women. Sorry, Bill, we do count Black women.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, with other medical organizations, said in a statement that the Dobbs decision will \"certainly lead to unnecessary patient suffering and harm.\" The Lancet, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals, went further , saying: \"Women will die ... [Supreme Court Justice Samuel] Alito and his supporters will have women's blood on their hands.\" The American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Medical Association have also condemned anti-abortion laws. This is not theoretical: These are living, breathing people whose deaths will be an incalculable loss.\n\nMany of the pro-abortion rallying cries over the past few months have centered the idea that only safe abortion can be outlawed. While it's certainly true that abortion will continue , this sentiment is not entirely correct. We are not returning to the pre-Roe era of coat-hanger and back-alley abortions. Today we have medication abortion, a highly effective and safe combination of mifepristone and misoprostol that has been used legally in the U.S. since 2000, and which received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2021 to be mailed via telemed. The pills can be ordered online and delivered to all 50 states through international organizations like Aid Access .\n\nAbortion is not as divisive as hard-line opponents want us to believe. According to the Pew Research Center , 61% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while only 37% believe it should be illegal in all or most cases. Extreme abortion bans are unpopular, but many of the anti-abortion laws being passed are exceptionally cruel . Twelve states have enacted laws making no exception for pregnancy due to rape or incest, and three states don't even make an exception to save the pregnant person's life.\n\nWe are never going back. Instead, we are moving toward a darker future of increased legal surveillance and criminalization of all people who can become pregnant, regardless of their feelings about abortion.\n\nOne in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage ― and there is virtually no way to tell the difference between a spontaneous abortion (the medical term for miscarriage) and an induced abortion. Anyone with an adverse pregnancy outcome is open to investigation and criminalization. Indeed, this is already happening . We can expect it to increase as states pass laws offering bounties to private citizens who report their neighbors . Anyone who can get pregnant is at risk, but members of already marginalized communities are most likely to be targeted. Marshae Jones was indicted for manslaughter after being shot and suffering a miscarriage, because prosecutors felt she hadn't tried hard enough not to get shot. She was released after public outcry, but there are countless other people in similar positions .\n\nEven if you have a miscarriage and you aren't criminalized, you shouldn't count on receiving medical care. Many doctors are reluctant to treat complications from miscarriage , which aren't rare. People can have prolonged bleeding, difficulty passing products, or serious infections. Some doctors will not even receive training on how to manage these complications due to the abortion bans within their states, putting all pregnant people at risk. Recently, for example, some pharmacists have refused to fill misoprostol prescriptions , which can be used for management of miscarriage or abortion ― or treatment of gastric ulcers.\n\nFetal personhood laws give the government broad authority to criminalize pregnant people. The South Carolina courts ruled that pregnant people who use drugs can be prosecuted for child abuse and murder. In Oklahoma, Brittney Poolaw was convicted for manslaughter after she had a miscarriage in a hospital and admitting to using drugs, though there was no evidence the drug use caused the miscarriage.\n\nWith these laws, people struggling with addiction are less likely to seek prenatal care and drug treatment programs, resulting in worse outcomes for parents and children. States continue this criminalization despite evidence-based recommendations from ACOG opposing the practice. People have even been criminalized for taking medications that were prescribed and monitored by a doctor. When stripping people's bodily autonomy and freedoms in the name of health, lawmakers are unfortunately not required to enact laws based on medical evidence, or laws that improve health and safety outcomes.\n\nBy making fetuses people, you also strip the rights of potentially pregnant people in any number of ways. If a pharmacist dispenses a medication that results in abortion ― for treatment of cancer, say, or autoimmune conditions ― are they responsible for murder in the eyes of the law? If your health insurance paid for the medication, are they accomplices to homicide? Very few medications are approved for use during pregnancy because of the reluctance to perform prescription drug trials on pregnant people. How far does someone have to go to prove they're not pregnant to access routine health care? This will worsen as states race to inflict the most punitive restrictions. Everyone who can become pregnant will have their access to basic medical care limited.\n\n\"Anyone with an adverse pregnancy outcome is open to investigation and criminalization. Indeed, this is already happening.\"\n\nEven in cases where a person's life is threatened (and the state allows such exceptions), clinicians and lawyers are struggling to figure out exactly what that means. An ectopic pregnancy implants outside the uterus and cannot develop into a viable pregnancy. It's the top cause of first-trimester pregnancy death, and is always a medical emergency. Yet people are being turned away for treatment because the pregnancy has not yet ruptured and caused severe internal bleeding. In this example, imminent harm is clear, but the legality is still hazy. People diagnosed with cancer, or other conditions with no identifiable \"moment\" when their life is at risk, will not have access to life-saving treatment.\n\nSomeone who wants to deliver a healthy child can also face criminalization if they disagree with their doctor on any aspect of the pregnancy management. Vaginal birth after cesarean is common, and most obstetricians agree it's safe and can reduce pregnancy complications . Laura Pemberton 's doctors didn't agree, however, so they obtained a court order for her to undergo a C-section against her will.\n\nPemberton, a Florida woman, was taken into custody, had her legs strapped legs together and was forced to go to the hospital. She later sued, but Florida courts decided that the fetus' best interests outweighed her own First, Fourth and 14th Amendment rights. Despite this horrific medical abuse, and despite being put at increased risk of future pregnancy complications by the repeat C-section, Pemberton went on to deliver three children vaginally.\n\nAnti-abortion lawmakers manifestly have no intention of helping pregnant people have successful pregnancies, safe deliveries or healthy children. Republicans have voted against access to baby formula and free school lunches . They've unanimously voted down paid parental leave ( with the help of Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia), even though it improves health outcomes for infants . This means the U.S. is one of only 41 countries in the world without parental leave. States with abortion bans are less likely to have adopted Medicaid expansions to provide health insurance for postpartum parents and their children. Minimum wage is so low that millions of Americans can't afford to feed an additional mouth while keeping a roof over their heads. Yet politicians focus on forced birth and the criminalization of pregnant people and their doctors instead of meaningful policy solutions.\n\nSafety considerations aside, abortion access tangibly improves lives. The Turnaway Study, conducted by a research program at the University of California, San Francisco, found that people who are \"turned away\" from obtaining desired abortion care have worse outcomes across the board . When someone who wants or needs an abortion cannot have one, it increases the likelihood of being tethered in an abusive relationship, increases anxiety and mental health problems, and leads to higher rates of unemployment, poverty and reliance on public programs, among other things.\n\nAll people of all genders should have the right to control their bodies and be respected, whether or not they choose to explain their reasoning to you. People's reasons for seeking abortions are personal and fundamental to the core of their being. Studies like this just give us the scientific data to prove it.\n\nThe fall of privacy protections from Roe has far-reaching implications. Justice Clarence Thomas offered a grave preview in his Dobbs opinion , writing that the court should re-evaluate all rulings that deal with privacy, due process and equal protection legal standards set by Roe ― specifically citing cases that legalized contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas tweeted : \"Now do Plessy vs Ferguson/Brown vs Board of Education,\" referring to the decision desegregating public schools. Everyone who believes in basic human freedoms needs to fight against abortion criminalization, or the courts will take us back to a time when only property-owning white men were legally considered people.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "By Vowing to Codify Roe, Kamala Harris Ensures Continued Government Meddling in Abortion Care\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nReproductive justice advocates warn that stopping at enshrining Roe's protections would allow abortion bans and restrictions to flourish.\n\nAfter months of touring the country to push back against draconian restrictions on abortion care, Vice President Kamala Harris has made reproductive rights central to her nascent presidential campaign. She has pledged to turn back the clock on Dobbs, the Supreme Court ruling that eliminated constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n\"We need to put into law the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Harris told Politico. \"And that is about going back to where we were before the Dobbs decision.\"\n\nThat vision is not exactly visionary. A growing number of abortion advocates say that codifying Roe only guarantees government interference in reproductive health care - the very thing Harris has said she opposes.\n\nCalling to \"restore Roe is a call to continue banning abortion and to continue criminalizing pregnant people,\" said Dr. Jenni Villavicencio, an OB-GYN and complex family planning specialist who provides all-trimester abortion care. \"It is an outdated call that in reality threatens, harms, and punishes abortion seekers and their providers.\"\n\nAhead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week, dozens of advocates are calling for an expansive vision of abortion rights that they hope Harris and other politicians will embrace to create equitable reproductive health policy. They are pointing to a memo titled \" Abortion Justice, Now \" of which Villavicencio is a primary co-author, that lays out a vision of reproductive freedom that expands far beyond the reaches of Roe.\n\nThe memo calls on elected officials to instead enact protections for patients and doctors throughout pregnancy that center the needs of the most vulnerable, and it points to federal legislation filed last year as a first step in that direction. \"We can and should invest in bold policies, not restoring Roe,\" the 17-page memo reads. \"Given that past is prologue, a return to a Roe-era status quo squanders a once in a generation opportunity to reimagine reproductive rights, health, and justice.\"\n\nThe right to abortion guaranteed by Roe (carried through and refined under later Supreme Court decisions ) was always considered a floor and not a ceiling. In other words, Roe provided a base level of reproductive freedom but did not constrain states from going further to protect reproductive rights.\n\nFunctionally speaking, however, Roe provided anti-abortion activists and politicians the framework to begin restricting access even as the opinion's ink was drying. Roe and its progeny ultimately enshrined limits on abortion rights, allowing states to restrict abortion after a certain point in pregnancy, when the government's so-called interests in protecting fetal life give it the green light to impose limits on care.\n\nThe new abortion policy memo tackles these limitations head on. In addition to Villavicencio, the memo's authors include Dr. Colleen McNicholas , an OB-GYN who provides all-trimester abortion; Pamela Merritt, the executive director of Medical Students for Choice ; and Garin Marschall and Erika Christensen, directors of Patient Forward, which advocates for all-trimester abortion care. (Villavicencio and McNicholas recently co-founded the reproductive justice policy group Raven Lab for Reproductive Liberation , for which Merritt serves as a senior adviser.)\n\nIn the memo, they note that \"states were not required to ban abortion after viability,\" but Roe's framework allowed them to do so. As a pregnancy advanced under Roe, it was subject to increased surveillance while abortion was subject to increased restriction. The Roe framework and its generous caveats also encouraged a slew of other restrictions on access, such as waiting periods, that were ostensibly aimed at shoring up patient health and safety, but were mostly based on junk science . Thousands of such proposals have been filed in legislatures throughout the country, and since the early 2010s, well over 1,000 have made it onto the books. Read Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nBy the time the Supreme Court toppled Roe in its 2022 Dobbs decision, 43 states had banned abortion after some point in pregnancy. Since then, 14 states have banned abortion entirely , while 27 others imposed a gestational limit, many of them well before viability, which is generally considered to begin around 24 weeks. Limited exceptions, many of which are purposely vague , have seen pregnant people scrambling for care, increasingly across state lines.\n\nThe patchwork abortion rights system created under Roe, where socioeconomic status and ZIP code often determined whether a person was able to exercise their constitutional right to abortion, has also worsened exponentially over the last two years; in each case the most vulnerable and marginalized communities are largely left out of the fold.\n\nBut the Dobbs decision has also sparked sustained activism. Kansans were the first to speak at the ballot box when, less than two months after the Dobbs decision, voters fought back an effort to overturn the state's constitutional protection for abortion. Since then, every state that has taken up abortion has either voted to protect access or to fend off anti-abortion measures. So far, abortion measures in eight states have been certified for the ballot in November, with similar efforts underway in another three states.\n\nIn most of those states, voters will be asked to codify measures designed in Roe's image - in other words, abortion rights with an asterisk.\n\nVillavicencio belongs to an oft-vilified group of physicians that provide abortion care later in pregnancy, a fluid concept that can begin around 21 weeks. She lamented during a recent press conference that she has \"watched advocates, both elected and unelected, specifically use us and our patients as bargaining chips in their quests for political wins.\"\n\nWhile abortion later in pregnancy is uncommon , it is vital for those who need it . Still, political jockeying has for decades put a target on patients who seek such care, as well as their providers - even though the gestational and viability limits imposed on abortion care make little, if any, medical sense .\n\nThe advocates' new memo lays out the case for doing away with this framework altogether. Not only does the Roe paradigm cut off patients from care, but it also does the work of anti-abortion activists, Villavicencio said, helping them to \"enshrine a place for the government in pregnancy decisions.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe memo calls for federal, statutory protection for abortion that eliminates the incentive for governments to interfere with reproductive choices. Even though the notion of viability is fluid and can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy, the memo notes, gestational and viability limits encourage the policing of pregnancy - and have fueled a rise in its criminalization .\n\nFor the government to impose these artificial lines would reinforce the \"underlying logic\" of the fetal personhood movement, which argues that fetuses enjoy the same constitutional rights as actual people and is the end game for far-right anti-abortion activists and a goal laid out in the 2024 Republican Party platform. \"Enshrining a viability standard in federal law is not an incremental step toward expansive rights,\" reads the memo. \"On the contrary, viability and gestational duration limits are an incremental step toward establishing fetal personhood.\"\n\n\"Viability and gestational duration limits are an incremental step toward establishing fetal personhood.\"\n\nAhead of the DNC, more than 200 organizations and individuals have signed on in support of the new policy memo. They point, in part, to the Abortion Justice Act , introduced in June 2023 by Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., as a model for abortion protection going forward. The bill would eliminate government intrusion in individual reproductive health decisions and expand access to care, in part through federal grants to support the training of abortion providers, the construction of clinics, and the direct support of individuals seeking care.\n\nThe policy memo builds on a foundation that is readily available and advocates for a more inclusive vision of reproductive freedom and equality, Merritt, Raven Lab's senior adviser, said. \"The Abortion Justice Now position is an incredibly necessary tool,\" she said. \"We have created a tool that we really do want the movement to use to combat not just the anti-abortion movement's playbook, but also to combat the fear of organizing toward justice.\"\n\nEnshrining Roe just won't cut it, she said. \"We have spent 49 years in a defensive posture, protecting Roe, because it's what we got. ... It is simply not the framework we need in 2024 and moving forward.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Roe Was Never Enough to Ensure Reproductive Freedom\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden vowed to codify Roe. But the ruling was never about whether the government had a right to your body, only when it had a right to your body.\n\nIn his state of the Union address, President Joe Biden zeroed in on the chaos that has ensued in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to cast reproductive rights out of the Constitution.\n\nHe talked about Latorya Beasley , an Alabama woman in the audience whose plans to have a second child using in vitro fertilization were scuttled after the state's Supreme Court announced that embryos created via IVF were \" extrauterine children .\" The ruling prompted IVF providers in the state to halt services.\n\nBiden also talked about Kate Cox, a Dallas mother in attendance who asked a Texas court for permission to terminate a nonviable pregnancy. A district judge agreed that her situation met the medical exception to the state's merciless abortion ban. But the attorney general and state Supreme Court balked , forcing Cox to flee Texas to receive care meant to protect her life and future fertility.\n\n\"Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,\" Biden said . He noted that the Supreme Court's majority opinion overturning Roe referred glibly to women having electoral power - and thus the political ability to overcome the ruling. Indeed, Biden said, state ballot measures enshrining reproductive rights won handily in 2022 and 2023. \"Those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women,\" Biden said to thunderous applause.\n\n\"If you, the American people, send me a Congress that supports the right to choose,\" he said, \"I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile that might sound good, Roe was never enough to ensure reproductive autonomy in the first place. The ink was barely dry on the 1973 decision before its supposed protections came under attack. In 1976, Congress passed a measure that stripped government funding for abortion for low-income people. In the decades that followed, elected officials and the courts took a hammer to Roe - even as the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld its core ruling -passing and then blessing hundreds of restrictions, some targeting abortion facilities and doctors with excessive regulation, others erecting barriers between pregnant people and care, many of them based entirely on junk science .\n\nRoe was never enough to guarantee that everyone in need of reproductive care could meaningfully access it. It was always a paper-based right that depended on status and ZIP code, leaving low-income people and other vulnerable groups out of the fold.\n\nAnd that's because Roe had a deep and unmalleable flaw: It was never about whether the government had a right to your body, only when it had a right to your body. Roe ensured that at some point, a pregnant person would lose the right to autonomy, which in turn guaranteed, if not wholly encouraged, the surveillance and criminalization of pregnant people.\n\nAlso present in the chamber for Biden's state of the Union speech was a woman from Ohio named Brittany Watts. Her story is emblematic of Roe's failures.\n\nWatts had been to the hospital several times before she miscarried at her home southeast of Cleveland. She was nearly 22 weeks pregnant - the cutoff for abortion under Ohio law - and her water broke early. The fetus was not viable, and even though she was under the state's gestational cutoff, the Catholic hospital she went to for help failed to intervene.\n\nIn September 2023, Watts miscarried the pregnancy in her bathroom. Back at the hospital later that day, Watts was soothed by a nurse who had already called the cops on her. Prosecutors charged Watts with \"abuse of a corpse.\" In justifying the charge, they vilified Watts, saying she put her \"baby into the toilet\" and then \"went on\" with her day. The truth was that she'd sought treatment, miscarried in the toilet, and then, scared, went to a scheduled appointment before diverting to the hospital.\n\nThe arrest caused a national uproar. Watts's attorney argued that her client was being \"demonized\" for miscarrying, \"something that goes on every day .\" Nonetheless, a municipal court judge allowed the case to go to a grand jury: \"There are better scholars that I am to determine the exact legal status of this fetus, corpse, body, birthing tissue, whatever it is.\"\n\nUltimately, the grand jury declined to indict Watts, and she was cleared. But the bottom line is this: Roe did not save her. While the ruling had been overturned by the time Watts came under the scrutiny of the criminal legal system and its proxies in health care, Ohio's remaining legal protections were based on Roe's structure, including the gestational limit of 22 weeks.\n\nThe judge sent the matter to a grand jury precisely because the miscarried fetus might have had some legal rights, leaving Watts's personal medical circumstances open to judgment by the government.\n\nIn contemplating a role for the government in a person's reproductive life, Roe and its progeny deemed that outside intervention was acceptable later in pregnancy, when the fetus could be viable outside the womb. Generally speaking, this is accepted to occur around 24 weeks. But it is also a fluid concept. Anti-abortion activists had long advocated for pushing up the viability line, arguing that medical advancements meant a fetus could be supported outside the womb even sooner - thus encouraging greater governmental oversight of pregnancy.\n\nWhile the notion that there is some government interest in protecting a fetus later in pregnancy might seem reasonable, pregnancy is a highly individualized experience and complications or circumstances that arise cannot be generalized or fairly conscripted to government control. The entire term of a pregnancy depends on the person carrying it, and the right to intervene in that pregnancy should lie with the individual.\n\nIn the years before Roe fell, near-total bans on abortion had become commonplace, passing in a number of states under the notion that legal personhood should begin before the person exists. It was the framework of Roe that allowed these power grabs, regardless of whether they were blocked by various courts before the Supreme Court said otherwise. Since the fall of Roe, several states have sought to codify its protections, as Biden said he would do given the chance. But that just reimagines the same inadequate framework. In November, Ohio became the seventh state to enshrine reproductive rights post-Roe when voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state constitution that guarantees access to abortion free from government intervention - before viability.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nOpting to hew to the line Roe cast is seen as politically safe. But recent research suggests the electorate isn't so sure .\n\nIn June 2023, research firm PerryUndem conducted an experiment involving more than 4,000 registered voters and two reproductive rights amendments. The first amendment was the exact language passed by Michigan voters in 2022, which allows the government to regulate abortion after fetal viability. The second amendment mirrored the first but stripped out any role for the government.\n\nWhich amendment did voters prefer? By a large margin - 15 points - participants preferred the clean amendment, free of government control. \"Which is it?\" one voter said when asked about concerns with the first amendment. \"Do we have individual freedoms or is the state controlling us?\"\n\nBonyen Lee-Gilmore, vice president of communications for the National Institute for Reproductive Health , put it bluntly: The voters are out ahead of the government, she said, and even ahead of many reproductive rights organizations. People see that government involvement is a trap. And yet there is disagreement among reproductive rights organizations when it comes to the path forward, with many hedging, believing a Roe-like framework might pull us more quickly out of the current, hideous abyss. But that only takes us backward to days that were never all that great.\n\nAs we move forward, we need to think about what we really want - and what we can do to guarantee fully autonomous reproductive lives for all. Among those pushing for a holistic and inclusive approach is the NIRH's Learning and Accountability Project.\n\n\"The public has never been more with us, more willing to reject government interference in our reproductive lives and futures,\" the organization and its partners wrote on Medium. In each election since Roe was overturned, \"we've won. But voters can only vote for what we put in front of them. It's time to offer something more.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "In Overturning Roe, Radical Supreme Court Declares War on the 14th Amendment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAlito's opinion completely elides the significance of the 14th Amendment, which was explicitly designed to address the particular horrors of slavery, including the right of individuals to determine whether, with whom, and when to form a family.\n\nLess than an hour after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution no longer recognizes the right to abortion, and that the decision about whether individuals enjoy reproductive freedom should be decided by individual states, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt was ready.\n\nIn a four-page letter sent to the state's Revisor of Statutes, Schmitt wrote that he was pulling the trigger on the state's blanket ban on abortion - a law that had been sitting dormant, waiting for Roe v. Wade to fall. \"With this attorney general opinion, my Office has effectively ended abortion in Missouri, becoming the first state in the country to do so following the Court's ruling,\" he said in a press release.\n\nDuring a subsequent press call, Yamelsie Rodríguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said that the state's sole remaining abortion clinic had gone dark. \"Shortly after the decision came down, we notified the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services that we are ceasing abortion services in the state of Missouri. We have reached the end of the line for abortion care,\" she said. \"Today is the worst-case scenario for the 1.3 million people of reproductive age who live in the state of Missouri, where abortion is now banned.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIndeed, with the fall of Roe, 22 states are poised to ban abortion almost immediately; four other states are expected to follow suit . Thirteen of those states have sleeper, so-called trigger bans on the books, like Missouri, that will now rapidly take effect across a large swath of the country. In all, tens of millions of people of reproductive age will be left without access to abortion.\n\nThe court's consequential ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization represents the culmination of decades of conservative ideological assault on reproductive freedom. And it opens a door for the court's 6-3 supermajority to strike down a host of other protections grounded in the Constitution's promise of individual liberty that the court declares in Dobbs are not actually rooted in \"history and tradition\" - including the right to use contraception, the right to consensual sexual relations, and the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nStill, the text of the majority ruling, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, is not entirely new: The substance of the ruling has not changed since a leaked draft of the opinion was published by Politico in May. As he did in the leaked opinion, Alito goes on at length about how history doesn't include a right to abortion (notably citing the \"great\" Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th century judge who sentenced two \"witches\" to death and advocated for a husband's right to rape his wife); gives a nod to the ahistorical idea that abortion is akin to eugenics; and seems perplexed by the idea that any reliance interests may have developed around the 50-year-old abortion precedent - in other words, he can't see how generations of people may have internalized the guarantee that they have the right to plan and control their reproductive lives.\n\nOriginal reporting.

According to the Alito majority, there are two limited categories of rights protected by it: Those specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments - like the ( apparently absolute ) right to bear arms - and those that comprise \"a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.\" And where that select list is concerned, Alito writes that the court must basically determine whether a right was considered as such in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was ratified. He concludes that abortion wasn't firmly accepted then and so cannot be considered so now.\n\nIn fact, Alito's opinion scoffs at the idea that individual liberty would include a person's ability to make autonomous intimate personal choices. \"While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they wish about 'existence,' 'meaning,' the 'universe,' and 'the mystery of human life,' they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts,\" he wrote. \"These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one's 'concept of existence' prove too much.\" That criteria, \"at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like,\" he wrote.\n\nAlito's opinion completely elides the significance of the 14th Amendment, a Reconstruction-era addition explicitly designed to address some of the particular horrors of slavery , including ensuring the right of individuals to determine whether, with whom, and when to form a family. \"These explicit protections for equality and liberty were written into our national charter at a time when the question of what it truly meant to be free, as a matter of law, was urgent and pressing,\" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said in a statement. \"The Fourteenth Amendment provided this measure of equality and more. The Court's conservative majority - which claims to follow text and history where it leads - instead turns a blind eye to these central precepts at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe majority's position also fails to engage with another obvious point: The 14th Amendment was ratified by white, property-owning men - in other words, women weren't contemplated as equal under the law. Taking the majority's logic at face value, that would mostly remain the case.\n\nIn their dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan grapple with this problem directly and at length. \"Of course, 'people' did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for women's liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation,\" they wrote. \"When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship.\"\n\nThe point of a constitutional right is to protect it against \"all comers,\" the dissent wrote. But by undoing decades of protections for reproductive freedom, the majority has unleashed sweeping changes that will leave individuals vulnerable to the whims of various state politicians. \"Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist's child or a young girl her father's - no matter if doing so will destroy her life,\" the justices wrote. \"So too, after today's ruling, some States may compel women to carry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies ... sure to die within a few years of birth. States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm,\" they continued. \"Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child.\"\n\n\"Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today's decision is certain: the curtailment of women's rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.\"\n\nUnmooring abortion from individual liberty rights also jeopardizes any number of rights similarly understood to have a home in the 14th Amendment, the dissent warns. \"The Constitution will, today's majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all,\" they wrote. \"And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.\"\n\nAbortion rights rose directly from the right to contraception, as decided in 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut and its progeny. \"In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions.\"\n\nIn the majority opinion, Alito disregards this concern, insisting that none of the other rights are in jeopardy because abortion is different - because it involves potential life - and accusing the dissent of stoking \"unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights.\" Still, at least part of the majority isn't signing on to this assurance. In a concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote explicitly that those other rights should be overturned. While he agreed that the right to contraception, consensual sex, and same-sex marriage weren't on the table in the Dobbs case, he wrote that they're actually no different from abortion in that they too have no 14th Amendment protection and thus must go. \"No party has asked us to decide 'whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised,'\" he wrote. But in the future they should consider the entire class of rights, because any granted on that basis are \"demonstrably erroneous,\" he wrote, and \"we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\"\n\nDuring a press call, Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who argued the Dobbs case before the court on behalf of the Jackson Women's Health Organization, called the ruling cataclysmic. \"The Supreme Court has taken away people's ability to make basic decisions about their bodies, lives, and health,\" she said. \"Generations of people have relied on this right, and they'll now be thrown into a world without it.\" It is \"the biggest rollback of women's rights in our history.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Roe Is Dead. Long Live Roe?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe first state constitutional protection of reproductive rights hints at the contradictions and fears of a divided movement.\n\nActivists participate in a candlelight vigil on abortion rights in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 13, 2021, in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, 26 states are \"certain or likely to ban abortion,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute . In December, the court heard arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , addressing Mississippi's Gestational Age Act banning abortion after 15 weeks' pregnancy. The law is a deliberate violation of Roe, the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion. Most observers expect the conservative majority to rule in Mississippi's favor. In that case abortion law would revert to the states, where in vast red swaths of this nation it has been so slashed and shredded that it's already practically confetti.\n\nMeanwhile, 15 states are doing what they can to rescue the legal right to abortion. Twelve are crafting legislation, like New York's Reproductive Health Act, that reaffirms in statute the court's ruling in Roe. Three, and the District of Columbia, are moving beyond Roe: codifying a right to abortion throughout pregnancy without state interference. And one state, Vermont, is doing a little of both: proposing a state constitutional amendment that enshrines individual reproductive liberty as a basic right - and then hedging, suggesting that it may not be that basic after all.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThese varying approaches show that the reproductive justice movement is divided not just about how to shelter legal abortion in its last redoubts now, but also how to win it back for all and for good. Before Roe, the question was: Reform abortion laws or repeal them altogether? Today that translates to: Hang onto a tattered Roe or scrap it and start anew? Vermont's hybrid - or self-contradictory - strategy may hint of both a realization and a fear. Roe is probably a dead letter. But it is still a letter, something to hold onto. The movement's confidence may be as tattered as the right it's trying to defend.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nWhat is wrong with Roe? A lot. First, it's based on the right of privacy established in Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 ruling affirming a married couple's freedom to use birth control. Many critics (including me) have argued that privacy - a young, relatively untested \"penumbral\" right not named in the Constitution but implied by other amendments - is a fragile support for the weighty human right of reproductive autonomy. Why not, say, the 13th Amendment's prohibition on involuntary servitude, the use of one's body against one's will?\n\nThe second weakness is the framework the court set up in Roe, which shifts the balance of the state's interest from the pregnant person's rights as independent actor (and the fetus as part of the pregnant person) in early gestation to the fetus's potential life as it matures toward viability: the point at which a baby can survive outside the womb, now about 24 weeks. A decade after Roe, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor alerted her colleagues that science was pushing viability earlier and earlier in gestation, progressively shaving weeks off the mother's liberty; Roe, she said , was \"on a collision course with itself.\" And indeed, hardly an instant later, abortion opponents started revving the engines to accelerate that collision, promoting the myths - and passing laws based on them - that a fetus can feel pain during abortion or survive on its own at the first indication of a \"fetal heartbeat\" less than six weeks after conception. During oral arguments in Dobbs, Chief Justice John Roberts showed eagerness to eliminate the viability standard altogether, in effect cutting the brake line that keeps Roe from crashing.\n\nThe third flaw in the past 40-some years of legally defending Roe is the test O'Connor proposed as more enduring than viability: that the law impose no \"undue burden\" on the ability to get or provide an abortion. Undue burden is even feebler than privacy. At this point, there may be no burden SCOTUS's conservatives consider undue: not driving thousands of miles , not having an ultrasound probe shoved up your vagina for no reason , not paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket . Apparently, no emotional burden is undue either. During the Dobbs colloquy, Trump appointee Justice Amy Coney Barrett brought up \"safe haven laws,\" which allow people to leave an unwanted newborn at a hospital or fire station anonymously and without criminal liability. Wouldn't these provisions \"take care of [the] problem\" of forced parenthood, Barrett mused. Julie Rikelman, attorney for the abortion provider, responded that the issue at hand was forced pregnancy, which \"imposes unique physical demands and risk on women and in fact has impact\" on their families and livelihoods. Court etiquette inhibited Rikelman from voicing what was likely on her mind: \"And which of your seven children would you put in a basket and float down the Nile, Your Honor ?\"\n\nVermont's Reproductive Liberty Amendment aims to overcome these weaknesses. Introduced in 2019, the amendment easily passed the state Legislature, the mandated second time, this session. If the electorate votes yes on Proposition 5 on the November ballot, it will become part of the Vermont Constitution the next day. This is what it says:\n\nThat an individual's right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one's own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.\n\nAt its most basic, the amendment makes permanent \"conditions on the ground,\" Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint, a co-sponsor and active champion of the bill, told me. This is a good thing, because at present Vermont's policies are exemplary. The state requires no parental involvement in a minor's decision to end a pregnancy, for instance, and compels Medicaid and private insurance to cover abortion and birth control. Healthy majorities support reproductive justice. The amendment passed the House by a vote of 107 to 41. Seven in 10 Vermont adults favor the right to abortion in most cases.\n\nIn this sense, the amendment might be more symbolic than practical. Still, as the first in the nation, the text serves as a signpost for other states. The problem: It's hard to know which direction the signpost is pointing.\n\nThe first part, up to and including \"shall not be denied or infringed,\" is radical. It asserts that the roughly half of humans who bear uteruses are free to do with their bodies as they wish, period. The second half telegraphs second thoughts. The phrase \"unless justified by a compelling state interest\" hints that there might be legitimate and compelling justification to violate the fundamental right the state just finished declaring.\n\nWhat compelling interest might Vermont have to violate the human right to bodily autonomy? This is not a theoretical question. All sorts of arbitrary and burdensome restrictions on abortion claim a compelling state interest. \"Whereas the State of Florida has a compelling interest from the outset of a woman's pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child,\" and \"the pregnant woman has a compelling interest in knowing the likelihood of her unborn child surviving to full-term birth based upon the presence of cardiac activity,\" reads Florida's Heartbeat Act , language that is nearly identical to other fetal heartbeat laws, including Texas's , which effectively ban abortion at six weeks. In defending its 15-week ban, Mississippi had the chutzpah - and the wit - to use Roe and other pro-choice precedents against themselves. \"The Supreme Court has long recognized ... an 'important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life,'\" it argued, quoting Roe. It went on to cite the state's \"interest in protecting the life of the unborn\" as well as its \"legitimate interests from the outset of pregnancy in protecting the health of women,\" both from Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed Roe in 1992.\n\nThe Vermont amendment's sponsors do not agree that its second clause kneecaps the first. The terms \"compelling state interest\" and \"least restrictive means,\" they note, echo the language of \"strict scrutiny,\" the highest level of judicial review. To be upheld as constitutional under this standard, a law must further a \"compelling governmental interest\" that cannot be achieved in any other way - and that way must be narrowly defined. One of the few triggers for strict scrutiny is the challenge that the legislation abridges a fundamental right.\n\nIf the \"unless\" clause is compromise language intended to win more votes, neither Balint nor the chief sponsor, Vermont Senate Health and Welfare Committee Chair Ginny Lyons, admitted as much. Both insist that Clause No. 2 only strengthens the fundamental right to reproductive liberty. \"Remember that the Roe v. Wade decision was based on something called privacy that doesn't exist in the Constitution,\" Lyons told me. \"What we've learned from that is to place reproductive autonomy in the broader context of the state constitution.\"\n\nArticle 1 of the Vermont Constitution proclaims: \"All persons are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights.\" Interestingly, also on Vermont's ballot this November is Proposition 2 , asking voters to ratify another amendment - no easy task in this state. Prop 2 repeals Article 1's second half, which abolished servitude or slavery, \"unless bound by the person's own consent\" or in payment of a debt. In its place would be the simple sentence \"Slavery and indentured servitude in any form are prohibited.\"\n\nAppending an asterisk to a human right is asking for trouble. Does the Eighth Amendment prohibit cruel and unusual punishment \" unless justified by a compelling state interest \"? Does the 19th proclaim, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex - unless justified by a compelling state interest \"? The one U.S. constitutional amendment with an exception written into it is the 13th, banning slavery and involuntary servitude \"except as a punishment for crime.\" As Michelle Alexander and other scholars argue, this loophole, inserted to gain ratification from Western states ambivalent about slavery, allowed the reincarnation of slavery in striped prison garb during Jim Crow and led to the mass incarceration of the descendants of enslaved people. What if Vermont's \"unless\" clause, intended to preempt violation, actually invited it?\n\nAt a meeting in the late 1960s, Cindy Cisler, a Redstockings co-founder and leading feminist organizer for repeal - not reform - of abortion laws, held up a blank piece of paper. \"This,\" she declared, \"should be the abortion law.\"\n\nNow that there's little left to lose, we might as well start over with what we really want. Replace the consumerist concept of reproductive choice with the principle of reproductive justice: not just the right to terminate a pregnancy but also to carry one healthily to term and raise the child in a safe and sustainable environment; not just the right to contraception but also the right to refuse it and to be free from forced sterilization or other eugenic coercions. Build this expansive definition of reproductive justice into the right to bodily autonomy. Elevate bodily autonomy in the U.S. to its global status, as an inalienable human right.\n\nThen we should demand what we need from the government when it comes to abortion law. That is, nothing .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The End of Roe: Saving Abortion Rights Means Taking Them Into Our Own Hands\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe relentless right and feckless Democrats brought us here. Now, preserving access to abortion will require breaking some laws.\n\nA police officer carries a barricade as demonstrators gather to protest a leaked draft opinion poised to strike down the right to abortion in the U.S. in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on May 3, 2022.\n\nFor months now, if not years, front-line abortion providers and advocates for access have been writing about the fall of Roe v. Wade as a \" when ,\" not an \"if.\" The end of Roe has already arrived in dozens of states where Republicans have forged a post-Roe reality by cutting off access to abortion and criminalizing its provision.\n\nYet the unprecedented leak Monday night of a Supreme Court draft opinion, signaling the final and unambiguous undoing of already weak constitutional abortion protections, curdles the blood even of those who saw it coming. More women and pregnant people will suffer and die; poor people of color will be affected in disproportionate numbers.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe blame lies squarely with the powerful Christian right, aided and abetted by cynical fascoid right-wingers, who have set their sights on pregnant people's bodily autonomy for decades. They will not respond to our rage and protests. They will push on with their authoritarian agenda. Despite claims to states' rights in the leaked opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, there is clear evidence that if Republicans retake Congress in November, they will seek to pass a federal abortion ban .\n\nThere is no reasoning with fascists. Our energies must go elsewhere: placing fierce and unwavering pressure on Democrats, spineless as they have been, to act on this issue while they still have some control of the legislature. It should never have come to this - the end of Roe with zero nationwide legislative protections for abortion access.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nDemocrats in Congress should have long ago codified the right to abortion access, as the party's left flank has urged , but they didn't. If they don't act now to end the filibuster and pass abortion protection laws, they will deserve something approaching the same level of blame directed at anti-abortion Republicans.\n\nAfter Texas passed an effective abortion ban last year, which was ruled unconstitutional by a state judge in December, President Joe Biden vowed to \"launch a whole-of-government effort\" to protect the right to abortion in the state. We are yet to see any such effort, even though, as I wrote at the time, there are a number of steps his administration could immediately take.\n\nIf - and this really is an if - the fear of a nationwide abortion ban and the shock of Roe's undoing galvanizes Democratic voters in November, these will once again be votes against a greater evil, rather than votes the Democrats have earned. Just as today's Democratic Party has refused to take the lead on this issue even as abortion access has fallen apart in so many places, they will not take the lead now. Instead, it is up to us - it always has been.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the draft opinion on overturning Roe v. Wade, photographed in Washington, D.C., on April 23, 2021.\n\nSince we cannot rely on Democratic leaders, we must - following the example of organizers on the front lines of this struggle - work around the law, exploiting the coming interstate jurisdictional chaos around abortion law that the end of Roe will bring into even sharper relief. The fight for free and accessible abortions has always required solidarity, risk, and cunning. To keep reproductive justice alive, we must fight on terrain beyond the law, in contravention of certain laws, or in post-Roe legal gray areas.\n\nThe end of Roe, as a forthcoming and crucial paper in the Columbia Law Review notes, will bring forth an entirely new battleground of interstate juridical conflict. States that support access rights will move to pass laws that protect abortion providers who treat out-of-state patients, while anti-abortion states will seek to pass laws to prosecute out-of-state providers.\n\nThis clashing bifurcation is already beginning to unfold: Legislators in Connecticut passed a bill last week designed to protect abortion providers who assist patients seeking refuge from abortion-ban states. Other blue states should follow this lead.\n\nMeanwhile, 26 states are ready with laws to enact abortion bans when Roe is undone and are passing ever more elaborate ways to criminalize abortions. Over a dozen of these states recently passed bans in their legislatures; other laws predate Roe but remain on the books and could snap back into effect. At present, only 16 states and Washington, D.C., have laws that actively protect the right to abortion.\n\nMajor interstate court battles along these lines are set to erupt after Roe - from the policing of women and other pregnant people's interstate travel, to the functioning of telehealth services that can prescribe abortion pills across state lines, to the criminalization of those who share resources and material support to aid abortions.\n\nThe Columbia Law Review paper's authors highlight that these fights will make a mockery of Republican claims that Roe has made abortion law more, rather than less, complicated. If legal confusions produce openings after Roe - spaces to set up new access sites and build greater networks, while finding new loopholes and ways to be ungovernable against repressive government action - we must take such advantage where we can.\n\nReproductive rights demonstrators protest outside the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on May 3, 2022.\n\nIt's already clear that there will be more arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonments of abortion providers, supporters, and seekers. A recent attempt by a local law enforcement agency in Texas to charge a young woman, Lizelle Herrera, with murder in connection to a \"self-induced abortion\" failed because no such murder statute for charging pregnant people currently exists in the state. We have seen, though, how swiftly such laws are changing for the worse.\n\nThe policing of this post-Roe world gives us much reason to fear - but even more reason to resist, and fight with and for the communities with the least power, who will no doubt be the most targeted.\n\nNetworks already exist to send abortion medication to jurisdictions where it has been made illegal. These will have to grow, using various online tools and techniques, physical mailing systems, and assistance with transportation - especially to ensure that those with the fewest resources are reached.\n\nCrucially, though, this fight is something to join, not invent anew. Many will be shocked by the end of Roe, but they need to realize that there are existing efforts and groups on the ground that need support, more so than major organizations like Planned Parenthood .\n\nOne thing that is abundantly clear in this still-emerging landscape is that we cannot focus solely on the law . Republican terror tactics against abortions have not hewed to existing statute; they have forged new realities to de facto ban abortion through brutal state action in clear violation of existing constitutional law and done so in the knowledge that these constitutional protections were on their last legs. The same extralegal Republican approach informs the right's attacks on trans lives, and they are constantly pushing it further.\n\nIn his draft opinion , Alito also criticizes Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated sodomy laws, and Obergefell v. Hodges, the ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. \"[N]one of these rights,\" the justice wrote, \"has any claim to being deeply rooted in history.\" This is what fascists and their allies are fighting for: not just an end to abortions, horrifying enough as that is, but the palingenesis of a nation, in which the only rights permitted to stand are those that protect property, patriarchy, and whiteness - such, in Alito's own framing, is the rooting of U.S. history.\n\nContrary to liberal mythologizing, the battle for bodily autonomy and justice was never won in the Supreme Court. The fight did not begin at the court, and it will not end there. On Monday night, a crowd of many hundreds gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington, chanting, \"Fascist scum have got to go.\" It is certainly in this antifascist spirit that the fight must go on.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "A \"Woodstock\" for Right-Wing Legal Activists Kicked Off the 40-Year Plot to Undo Roe v. Wade\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTwo hundred conservatives gathered at Yale Law School and coalesced into a group whose name was a joke: the Federalist Society.\n\nIn the early Reagan years, religious right movement leaders Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell knew that they could not solely rely on fickle politicians to implement their plan on a national scale. They didn't have public opinion on their side - certainly not on legal abortion, nor on other elements of their plan to maintain their privilege and power. In order to implement their anti-democratic policy agenda and political philosophy, they needed the influence and power of a court system impervious to the will of voters. In that pursuit, an institution named the Federalist Society became their main vehicle.\n\nIn 1982, a group of conservative students and professors gathered at Yale Law School giddy with the opportunity offered by Ronald Reagan's presidency. They spent the time discussing the perils of federalism, decrying the cultural influence of \"coastal elites,\" and listening to speakers who excoriated everything from New Deal politics to the legalization of abortion and its impact on \"acceptable sexual behavior.\" This relatively small crew of around 200 began the process of building a language and a culture around constitutional originalism, a designed approach of interpreting the Constitution very narrowly based on what the framers - all white, all men, all Christian - supposedly meant at the time they wrote it. They named the new group the Federalist Society as a bit of an inside joke. One of the organizers wrote to invite future Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork to help them, saying that the group \"settled on Federalist Society as a name which I suppose makes up in euphony what it lacks in accuracy. If you have any brilliant ideas for a better name, however, that would be splendid.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

They were all convinced that there was a desperate need for an antidote to what they believed was insidious left-wing bias in law schools. One of the student organizers, Steven Calabresi, recalled that \"part of Reagan's policy was to build up forces in battleground nations in order to topple enemy regimes, and I thought of us as kind of the same equivalent in law schools.\"\n\nPerhaps no speech better articulated the overarching mission of this new endeavor than that of Bork, who had recently been appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by Reagan, when he told the gathered students that the courts were legislating with made-up constitutional rights:\n\nThis is a process that is going on. It happens with the extension of the equal protection clause to groups that were never previously protected. When they began to protect groups that were historically not intended to be protected by that clause, what they are doing is picking out groups that should not have any disabilities laid upon them.\n\nGiven that Bork had excoriated the Civil Rights Act as being grounded in \"unsurpassed ugliness\" and had opposed Griswold v. Connecticut, which granted married couples the right to contraception, those who read the speech reasonably concluded that Bork did not include historically marginalized groups as meriting protection. This seminal speech was later invoked in Bork's Supreme Court nomination hearings and helped sink his chances at confirmation.\n\nThe weekend was a smashing success, with one prominent attendee comparing it to Woodstock for right-wing legal activists. The attendees left convinced that they were a silent majority, despite all evidence to the contrary. They believed that if they could make it socially permissible, many more students on college campuses would come out against liberalism. They emerged from the gathering energized to build the Federalist Society, a new effort to train and promote conservative-minded lawyers into prominent positions, with an eye toward installing far-right judges. Backed by a who's who of right-wing money, the fledgling group quickly grew from a handful of grassroots chapters on college campuses into a million-dollar organization with headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at least 75 campus affiliates. One of its initial backers was the John M. Olin Foundation, the force behind the establishment of business-friendly law and economics programs at law schools throughout the country.\n\nThe Federalist Society scoped out the legal aspect of Falwell and Weyrich's new strategy, and it found that abortion proved to be an excellent litmus test for likely members of the radical right. It turned out that young and ambitious legal minds who had an antipathy to Roe v. Wade were far more likely to be on board with the full agenda to assert control and maintain the status quo of right-wing power.\n\nEdwin Meese, a top aide to Reagan, hired many \"Federalists,\" as they came to call themselves. Other GOP operatives helped young, newly graduated Federalist Society lawyers find jobs. The movement was riding high when Chief Justice Warren Burger informed Reagan of his intent to retire in 1986. Reagan, in his second term with no reelection to plan for and chastened by the backlash to his Sandra Day O'Connor Supreme Court nomination, did two things: He moved to elevate right-wing ideologue William Rehnquist to occupy the position of chief justice. Then he nominated Federalist Society superstar Scalia to replace Rehnquist.

Photo: Darren Hauck/AP The fight over Rehnquist's ascension was bitter and divided. He had served on the court since 1972, having been nominated by President Richard Nixon. Rehnquist was a stalwart conservative cut from the same cloth as Weyrich. As a clerk for the Supreme Court, he had written a memo arguing against mandated school desegregation as the court considered Brown v. Board of Education. He consistently argued for prayer in school and capital punishment and against equal rights extending to gender and abortion rights - dissenting in the Roe case. His ascension was an affront to numerous causes and issues that Democrats had come to champion, and many fought his nomination bitterly. A witness testified to Rehnquist's efforts to suppress minority voting in the early 1960s and, in a heated argument, Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond overruled the request of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and others demanding more transparency and fact-finding. Rehnquist was finally confirmed by a vote of 65-33, and the Democratic holdouts were defeated.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, center, speaks at the the Federalist Society half-day conference on \"The Legacy of the Rehnquist Court\" on Feb. 23, 2006, in Milwaukee.\n\nThey were also exhausted. They voted to confirm Scalia the same day as the vote on Rehnquist. The Democrats had little fight left in them, and they had spent all of their political capital. Besides, the junior nominee was relatively unknown outside his own conservative legal circles, without an established paper trail on hot-button issues - a profile that became a staple of Federalist nominees. Scalia was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and went on to become one of the most right-wing justices in the history of the Supreme Court, upending norms by using oral arguments as political theater and writing scathing dissents in cases in which he was outnumbered.\n\nThe following year, Justice Lewis Powell - of the infamous Powell memo - announced his intention to step down, giving Reagan yet another opportunity to shape the court. Reagan drew again from the same well, nominating Federalist Society founding father Bork. The man who had used the original conference to decry \"the gentrification of the Constitution\" and to claim that states should be able to ban abortion and define \"acceptable sexual behavior\" was up. The new legions of Federalists were ecstatic about the possibility of having two of their own on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Democrats and progressives were not going to be caught flat-footed again. Opposition to Bork's nomination came fast and furious from civil rights and women's groups. Kennedy, who led the opposition, responded to the nomination by saying:\n\nRobert Bork's America is a land where women are forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police would break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government, and the doors of the federal courts would shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is - and is often the only - protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy. ... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate, and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.\n\nThe extreme ideology on display at Bork's initial Federalist speech came back to haunt him in the lengthy confirmation battle. Bork's nomination was defeated in a bipartisan vote after months of bitter fighting. The seat ultimately went to Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988. The Federalists were enraged and took a solemn vow to never let one of their own be sunk again.\n\nOther groups were also hard at work using law and the courts to tilt culture in the direction of the radical right's goals. In 1990, Christian televangelist Pat Robertson created the American Center for Law and Justice specifically to go head-to-head with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLJ held a stable of attorneys ready to jump into high-profile battles worldwide focused on its version of family values. The organization, today led by former President Donald Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow, has fought changes to the Kenyan constitution that would allow abortion, supported the government of Zimbabwe in its effort to criminalize homosexuality, and, closer to home, effectively blocked the construction of an Islamic cultural center near the World Trade Center site.

Jeb Bush during a presidential candidate forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 23, 2015. Photo: Steve Helber/AP In 1993, prominent evangelical Christian ministers founded the Alliance Defending Freedom to advance \"religious freedom, sanctity of life, and marriage and family\" through legal advocacy and funding court cases that tested legal precedent. In 1994, a Catholic lawyer named Kevin J. \"Seamus\" Hasson used seed money from the Knights of Columbus to round out these efforts with the Becket Fund, a nonprofit law firm solely devoted to promoting \"religious liberty.\" All of these groups shared a fundamental belief that their way of life was under attack and aimed to use the courts to impose a traditionalist, Christian ideology on the American public, echoing the demands for \"religious liberty\" that the radical right had first tested on its pro-segregation work in the 1960s.\n\nJay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, introduces former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during a presidential candidate forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 23, 2015.\n\nThey subsequently joined in common cause to choose a series of high-profile cases that they believed would cement the idea that liberal reforms around civil rights and gender equity amounted to an attack on traditional religion. In California, the ACLJ and its allies aggressively defended Proposition 8, the ballot measure designed to ban same-sex marriage in the state. Their rhetoric presented out-of-touch elites trying to foist a liberal agenda on the rest of the nation. In 2018, the Alliance Defending Freedom advocated in the Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which dealt with religious business owners' ability to refuse service to people based on their sexual orientation, for similar reasons.\n\nPerhaps the feather in the cap of the movement architects - some of whom did not live to see this day - was their victory in the 2014 Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act had mandated long overdue reform that contraception be covered by insurance at no extra cost to the employee. The owners of the craft supply chain Hobby Lobby sought to deny their employees this coverage, using their go-to claim that it violated their religious beliefs. Core to the plaintiffs' case was the claim that the owners of Hobby Lobby believed that some kinds of contraception were \"abortifacients.\" This term was straight out of anti-abortion propagandist John Willke's playbook. It suggested, with no grounding in medical fact, that birth control was tantamount to abortion. In a hotly contested 5-4 decision, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, opening the door to the erosion of all sorts of hard-won gains in the name of moral objection. Tellingly, the court's majority wrote that the fact that birth control did not actually cause abortions was irrelevant in this context. For a violation of religious liberty to occur, the plaintiff must only believe that it could happen. Four of the five justices who ruled in Hobby Lobby's favor had Federalist Society ties.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby case was a massive triumph for the radical right, underscoring the effectiveness of the mutually reinforcing strategies. The movement had effectively used abortion as a Trojan horse to move the goalpost, limit access to contraception, and enshrine disinformation into the legal canon. For them, it was icing on the cake that the victory undercut the ACA, a crowning achievement for the much-loathed Obama administration. They had effectively reversed one of the most significant national steps forward for gender equity in decades.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIn the first week of May 2022, a draft decision penned by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press laying bare the intention of the majority of the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many legal experts warned immediately that the draft was written to not only eradicate the current federal protection to abortion access, but also to lay the legal groundwork to undo a whole host of other rights guaranteed through the 14th Amendment protecting privacy and equality for all individuals.\n\nAlito repeated a common refrain from right-wing leaders and judges all the way back to Bork that the original interpretation of the 14th Amendment was just wrong. The ground is being set to review and revoke so many hard-won gains, from access to birth control to marriage quality. Six of the current occupants of the Supreme Court were nurtured and backed by the Federalist Society: Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts. The architects' plan has finally come to fruition, but this is only the beginning, not the end, of their quest to make sure we're all living in a world of their creation.\n\nThis article was adapted from the bestselling book \" The Lie That Binds,\" by Ilyse Hogue and Ellie Langford .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Roe v. Wade Is About to Be Struck Down by the Electoral College\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFour of the justices voting to overturn Roe were appointed by presidents initially elected while losing the popular vote.\n\nRoe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to abortion, was decided 7-2.\n\nAccording to Politico , the Supreme Court will soon strike down Roe v. Wade on a 5-4 vote.\n\nWhile the U.S. right has organized for decades in hopes of this result, it would never have come close to success without one factor: the Electoral College. There have been eight presidential elections over the past 30 years, and also eight Supreme Court vacancies. The bizarre reality of the U.S. political system is that Republicans have won the popular vote in just one of the eight elections, but got to choose five of the eight new justices. Of these five GOP picks, four are reportedly voting to reverse Roe.\n\nIn an alternate history in which presidents were elected by a simple plurality of voters, Roe would likely soon be upheld in the relevant case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, by a 7-2 or even 8-1 margin - assuming that the court even heard Dobbs in the first place.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nHere are the details of this history:\n\nPolitico's article features a draft opinion striking down Roe, which was written by Justice Samuel Alito. Politico also reports that Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett will vote with Alito.\n\nGorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett were appointed by President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College 304-227, thanks to extremely narrow victories in key states. Yet Trump got just 46.1 percent of the popular vote, while Hillary Clinton received 48.2 percent. In numerical terms, 65.854 million Americans voted for Clinton, while 62.985 million voted for Trump - an almost 3 million margin for Clinton.\n\nMoreover, voter turnout in 2016 was, by one way of measuring it, 59.2 percent. This means that just 27.3 percent of eligible voters chose Trump. Yet he was able to pick a third of the current Supreme Court. (And, of course, there were three vacancies for Trump rather than two because then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky refused to even allow a vote for the vacancy when Antonin Scalia died in 2016, during Barack Obama's presidency.)\n\nThen there's Alito, who was nominated by George W. Bush in 2005. Officially, Bush won the Electoral College against then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 by a margin of 271-266. In reality, a study of Florida ballots released in November 2001 found that Gore actually won the state, under any counting standard, and thus actually won the Electoral College vote. But since this was just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, no one dared bring it up.\n\nGore also won the popular vote, 48.4 percent to 47.9 percent. Over half a million more Americans voted for Gore than Bush. Voter turnout in 2000 was 54.3 percent, meaning Bush was the choice of 26.0 percent of eligible voters.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIt is true that Bush won both the Electoral College and the popular vote against John Kerry in 2004. However, it's extremely unlikely that Bush would have run again if he'd lost in 2000. The last time a president got his party's nomination, lost, and then got the nomination again and won, was Richard Nixon 54 years ago in 1968. Perhaps another Republican would have beaten Gore in 2004, or perhaps not.\n\nThe remaining justice apparently poised to strike down Roe is Thomas, who was appointed by George H.W. Bush. Bush won both the Electoral College and popular vote in 1988.\n\nOf course, it's impossible to know precisely how history would have played out if the United States had a system in which the candidate who got the most votes became president. But polls show that overturning Roe has been deeply unpopular for as long as the question's been asked. So if the composition of the Supreme Court reflected anything close to the perspective of most Americans, this day would never have come. Now that it's here, it's hard to know whether the court will retain any legitimacy. The basic facts suggest that it should not.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Democrats' Cowardice and Complicity in the Post-Roe World\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe liberal establishment refuses to take any sort of risk in the service of women's and other pregnant people's lives.\n\nXavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, speaks during a news conference about an action plan in response to the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in Washington, D.C., on June 28, 2022.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that the Biden administration and Democratic leadership in Congress are doing hardly anything to protect reproductive rights following the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\nSpeaking on \"Meet the Press\" this Sunday, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra made clear that his agency had little interest in exploring ways to use federal powers to ensure abortions remain available in states that have banned the procedure.\n\n\"Unless we're all going to say the word of the Supreme Court will no longer have value, we have to heed the word of the Supreme Court,\" Becerra said, before dismissing the suggestion - supported by a number of left-wing Democrats and rejected by the White House - of using federal lands to provide abortion services in states with bans.\n\nThis unbound deference to the moribund institution of the Supreme Court - paired with a cowardly refusal to take any sort of risk in the service of women's and other pregnant people's lives - is typical of the mainstream liberal response to the end of Roe. On the Sunday talk show, Becerra rejected the centrist host's suggestion to place temporary clinics on federal lands and force the courts to decide. Instead, the administration is throwing up its hands without even trying.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate how badly Democrats dropped the ball on preventing Roe from being endangered and then preparing for it to be overturned. The world after Roe, though, is showing the liberal establishment's cowardice and complicity when it comes to getting access to abortions for people who need them. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reading an Israeli poem to the repeated entreaties to vote harder, the utter failure is staggering.\n\nDemocrats in government are not the only ones whose scant resistance will ensure that the Christo-fascists can enforce their post-Roe reality. Numerous health care providers and nonprofit organizations - most notably Planned Parenthood - are acting with preemptive zeal to remove reproductive and other health care services, even while legal gray areas abound.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a group that does much good work but also exists firmly within the reluctant liberal establishment, has shown a lack of fortitude since the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision took down Roe last month. Planned Parenthood of Montana will no longer provide medication abortions for patients from South Dakota, Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma and will now require proof of residency for the treatment.\n\n\"The risks around cross-state provision of services are currently less than clear, with the potential for both civil and criminal action for providing abortions in states with bans,\" wrote Montana Planned Parenthood CEO and President Martha Fuller in an internal email to her staff, which was obtained by the Daily Beast. \"As we move forward, and learn more about risks, we will be offering guidance and implementing any necessary changes in policies and procedures for abortion care.\"\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Southwest Fort Worth Health Center in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 3, 2022.\n\nFuller is correct that the end of Roe brings about a new battleground of interstate juridical conflict : Republican-led statehouses are trying to find ways to prosecute out-of-state abortion providers. Numerous blue states are, thankfully, passing laws to combat this in turn. None of it is settled, and it remains legal for Planned Parenthood of Montana, where abortion is legal, to provide abortion pills to patients from out of state. Fuller even noted that surgical abortions would remain available for patients from any state.\n\nContinuing to provide medical abortions for all should be the very least a well-funded institution could do. Instead, in the name of litigiousness, Planned Parenthood handed yet another victory to the pro-natalist far right .\n\nIn Missouri, meanwhile, St. Luke's Health System, which operates 17 hospitals, pharmacies, and urgent care clinics in Kansas City, responded to the fall of Roe by immediately ending the provision of Plan B emergency contraception pills.\n\nWithin a day, however, the major health system reversed its decision. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson had clarified that the state's new abortion ban did not affect Plan B or similar products.\n\nThe health care provider's hair-trigger willingness to briefly stop providing Plan B remains chilling: a clear signal that as the GOP continues its fight to decimate all reproductive rights, including access to contraception, major hospital groups will follow in goose-step. In examples like St. Luke's, the hospitals and their lawyers have been at the vanguard of care removal - even before a law was on the books to coerce action.\n\nPolice look on as abortion rights demonstrators march past the house of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in Chevy Chase, Md., on June 29, 2022.\n\nIn the days since the Supreme Court's vile and long-predicted ruling, stories spread across social media of women who have been denied care, even care unrelated to ending a pregnancy.\n\nA Virginia woman with the autoimmune disease lupus tweeted that her doctor had stopped prescribing her medication, methotrexate, because it is considered an abortifacient: \"in less than one week i lost access to healthcare that i need because the drug could be used to induce abortions,\" she wrote. \"I live in Virginia and abortion is legal here. but it is not protected by law and individual providers and pharmacies can decide what they will and won't do re: abortifacients.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other stories are circulating of OB-GYNs in red states waiting to operate to end potentially deadly and always unviable ectopic pregnancies until the patient's life is in clear danger, so as to be in compliance with abortion bans' \"medical emergency\" exemptions.\n\nWhen Republicans designed abortion ban legislation to evade federal court challenges by relying instead on vigilante enforcement - like Texas's pernicious Senate Bill 8 - it was in the knowledge that health care providers would respond with litigious compliance. Under a privatized model of medical care, the bottom line will always trump a broader commitment to human health and flourishing.\n\nThat so many have given up on reproductive rights so swiftly, even those purportedly dedicated to reproductive health care, is a grim reminder that neither the medical nor the political establishment can be relied upon as allies in the struggle for a robust reproductive justice. It's hardly news: The U.S. medical system has long treated poor Black and brown women - who disproportionately suffer under abortion bans - as disposable.\n\nThankfully, while establishment Democrats, major nonprofits, and private health care groups act in timid compliance to fascist rule, sites of genuine resistance continue to grow. Collectives and individuals have long been committed to sharing information, support, resources , abortion pills , and services. They understand the need to navigate legal gray areas and work within, outside, and against violent laws.\n\nThose who continue to take risks to fight for reproductive justice make clear that real resistance is possible. They clarify, too, that those caving so readily to a fascist status quo are making a choice to stand on the wrong side of history.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

This is, of course, very bad for abortion rights.

Wade was not a good decision. It was grounded in respect for doctors' freedoms, not women's, and in the consumerist right to \"choose\" an abortion if you could pay for it, not in the right to equality. Three years after the Roe decision, Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment banning federal funding to allow poor women to get abortions. States began enacting more and more restrictions on abortion, requiring parental (and even spousal) notification or consent, forcing ultrasounds, compelling inaccurate speech by health care providers, placing onerous requirements on abortion clinics, barring late-term abortions, and so on.\n\nThere may have been a federal right to \"choose\" abortion, but for many women, especially poor, black, and brown, and young women, that didn't mean any ability to get one.\n\nWhen Roe was what we had, abortion rights activists were forced to defend it and argue within its pinched contours. The Supreme Court in Roe framed abortion as a private \"choice,\" so feminists defended the \"right to choose,\" to which antiabortionists retorted, \"It's a child, not a choice.\" Hillary Clinton defended the right to choose, but called abortion a \"sad and tragic choice.\" Many politicians could call themselves pro-choice, but, like President Biden, are unable to say the word \"abortion.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe will harm the lives of millions. Yet in the wake of this bitter defeat, we also have new opportunities to think bigger, better, about what we really want and deserve. We can finally focus not on defending a defective law, but on winning a legal and political framework for abortion rights that can actually deliver what we need. In the words of the feminist theorist and activist Selma James, it is time to embrace \"the perspective of winning.\"\n\nWe don't want Roe back. We want more.\n\nThe right to abortion in Roe was limited by the concept of viability. The decision assumed without explaining that the state has an interest in \"potential life\" that may trump a woman's autonomy and defined viability as the moment when the state's interest in the potential life of the fetus becomes compelling. By focusing on viability rather than birth, the decision refused to acknowledge the unique geography of pregnancy - by definition fetuses are located inside of human beings. Until birth, any contact between state and fetus must go through the woman. Therefore, birth would seem far more salient than viability. The decision treated the fact that at viability a fetus could survive outside a woman's body as equivalent to its actually being outside a woman's body, a strange leap, as it were, around the birth canal.\n\nThe Court in Roe v. Wade did not ground the right to abortion in equality, or even in women's freedom, but rather in the right of privacy. And not even women's privacy, but the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nIn Justice Harry Blackmun's decision, the freedom from government intrusion belonged not to individual women, nor even to women in consultation with their doctors, but to the \"physician, in consultation with his patient.\" Even this limited role for the pregnant woman dropped away by the time the holding was summarized a few pages on. During the first trimester, \"the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\"\n\nUnder Roe , women were free to \"choose\" without the government stopping them - but also without any social and financial support to provide the conditions for meaningfully free choice, and with women's freedom protected not in its own right but as a corollary of others' (doctors', husbands') freedom.\n\nThe difficult moral claim we make when we defend abortion is that women's lives have independent value, not subsidiary to anyone else's rights and not dependent on the judgment of anyone else. A woman is not of value only as a mother or a wife or a member of a family but in her own right, whether anyone else likes her choices or not. This means, among other things, respecting the unique geography of pregnancy, and therefore women's right to control it.\n\nSure, privacy is a good thing and we need it, as far as it goes. Like any health care procedure, my abortion is nobody's business but my own. But abortion is fundamentally an issue not of privacy but of equality. A woman cannot be a full and equal citizen if she faces the perpetual threat of being forced to bear a child against her will.\n\nMen may not need abortions to participate in society as equal citizens, but women do, and it is time to begin demanding what we need. We need not just the right to c hoose an abortion, but the right to get one, socially funded if necessary. Hillary Clinton was wrong to call abortion \"sad and tragic.\" The right to get an abortion when you want one is an affirmative good to which all who can get pregnant are entitled.\n\nTo regain our reproductive autonomy, we must unapologetically demand it. Otherwise, we will keep losing.\n\nCarolyn McConnell is a writer and lawyer who lives in Seattle.

Democrats must now use their power to fund abortion access and protect basic reproductive freedoms.\n\nDemonstrators outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, early on Tuesday, May 3, 2022.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Right is on the verge of achieving what it has promised to accomplish for decades: the destruction of a federal, constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nDemocrats have for years raised small donor cash off of the perpetual conservative threat to reproductive rights and then evaded opportunities to protect those rights, even when they had control of the White House and congressional majorities.\n\nThere are obvious lessons: don't lose winnable presidential elections to reality TV show hosts, don't protect the ego of aging celebrity judges when it could cost liberals Supreme Court seats, don't permit billionaires to anonymously buy lifetime appointments to the high court, and don't mobilize the party's electoral apparatus in defense of anti-choice politicians.\n\nIt's also a reminder of how minoritarian the United States government is. While the vast majority of Americans support the right to an abortion in at least some circumstances, five Supreme Court justices appointed by two presidents who lost the popular vote are positioned to overturn that right - and the judges' draft opinion scoffs at the idea that they have any responsibility to represent what the public wants.\n\nIndeed, they declare that \"we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction\" to the end of basic reproductive freedoms.\n\nDemocrats, presumably the pro-choice party, still control the executive and legislative branches, as well as many state governments across the country. If there's one lesson to act upon right now, it's that they must actually use the power of the government to fund abortion access and protect basic freedoms - something that, incidentally, might be more encouraging to the party's base than telling them to just keep voting blue , but even harder .\n\nYesterday's leaked draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito is a radical document, based on reasoning that questions the fundamental rights to same-sex and interracial marriage, contraception, the right to not be forcibly sterilized, and more. The opinion \"relies heavily on a 17th century English jurist who had two women executed for 'witchcraft,' wrote in defense of marital rape, and believed capital punishment should extend to kids as young as 14,\" according to reporting by Jezebel .\n\nWhile still in draft form, these extreme legal arguments are the culmination of decades of efforts by the American right to capture the Supreme Court.\n\nThey have done so by using the shadowy money and influence network run by Donald Trump judicial adviser Leonard Leo, an antiabortion zealot and longtime executive at the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers group in Washington. Leo helped select President Donald Trump's high court picks while simultaneously leading a dark money operation to boost their confirmations with TV ads and contributions to conservative groups that promoted the judges, too.\n\nLeo and his colleagues have been building their dark money network since 2005 , beginning with efforts to confirm justices John Roberts and Alito.\n\nIn 2016, Leo's Judicial Crisis Network led a successful campaign against confirming Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, before aiding the confirmations of Trump justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Through it all, these power brokers have been quiet and efficient - we still know very little about who's been financing Leo's network.\n\nThis might be one of the most powerful political coups in US history. Leo and his anonymous donors helped flip control of the court and build an ultraconservative supermajority that could last for decades - and they managed to accomplish this using two presidents (Trump and George W. Bush) who lost the popular vote.\n\nLeo's success was a product of lockstep unity between his network and Republican senators. While liberals have recently built their own well-funded pressure group focused on the courts, the group has effectively no influence, because party leaders have refused to consider taking aggressive actions to counter the GOP's maximalist strategy.\n\nFor much of the past two decades, the right-wing takeover of the courts was at best ignored and at worst aided and abetted by Democratic politicians and pundits who sanitized the reputations of radical, right-wing judges. (Of course, you never see a prominent Republican politician or talking head praising pro-choice judges.)\n\nThere was Neal Katyal, Obama's solicitor general, making the case for \"why liberals should back Neil Gorsuch.\" There was liberal pundit Noah Feldman declaring that \"Amy Coney Barrett deserves to be on the Supreme Court.\" There was liberals' favorite MSNBC regular, Steve Schmidt, boasting about his work leading the Bush administration's campaign to install Alito and Roberts on the high court.\n\nLiberal pundits also defended Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg when she declined to retire under a Democratic president, even though it threatened to hand another Supreme Court seat to the Right in the future. That is exactly what happened - and now Ginsberg's legacy has been tarnished far more significantly than it would have been by the personal sting of an early retirement.\n\nThe good news is that after a bit of preening and delaying, Justice Stephen Breyer seemed to learn the cautionary tale and decided to retire under a Democratic president. The bad news is that there were still liberals insisting that justices shouldn't be pressured to retire when it might help the principles they purport to support.\n\nBut the likely end of Roe v. Wade isn't just due to careful conservative plotting to overturn the law. It's also courtesy of Democrats' refusal on many occasions to safeguard reproductive rights from such political dismantling - despite being a party mostly comprised of pro-choice politicians.\n\nRoe v. Wade has been the law of the land since 1973, but its standing has always been tenuous. Democrats at the national level have not prioritized codifying reproductive rights and expanding abortion access during the periods when they've controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress - just as they do now.\n\nIn 2009, when Democrats held the presidency and large majorities in Congress, Obama was eager \"to straddle the abortion divide,\" according to reporting from the New York Times :\n\nBut even as Mr. Obama has delighted abortion rights advocates, he has dialed back some earlier ambitions. In 2007, he promised Planned Parenthood that \"the first thing I'd do as president\" would be to sign the Freedom of Choice Act, which effectively codifies Roe v. Wade . Now he says the bill is \"not my highest legislative priority,\" as he put it at a recent news conference.\n\nThe legislation to codify Roe sat in committees during that Congress, before Republicans swept the 2010 midterms.\n\nToday, for the first time since 2010, Democrats once again control Congress and the presidency. That means they still have the power to pass legislation codifying Roe into federal law.\n\nHere's the catch: They would have to end the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, and doing so would require them to apply real pressure on lawmakers in their own party amid the anti-choice movement's ongoing campaign to preserve filibuster rules. Democrats would need to have support from the entire Democratic caucus to end the filibuster and pass their abortion rights bill, since the Senate is split 50-50 and no Republicans are likely to support either move, even though Republican senators Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) claim to be pro-choice.\n\nAfter the House passed the bill to codify Roe last fall, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) in March joined every Republican senator in voting against it. Corporatist Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) says she supports codifying Roe, but it's all meaningless spin, since she still opposes ending the filibuster. (Manchin opposes ending the filibuster, too.)\n\nOn Tuesday, President Joe Biden - who once supported letting states overturn Roe - wouldn't even endorse ending the filibuster to protect abortion rights, even though he previously endorsed a plan to make an exception to the filibuster to try to pass voting rights. (As a senator, Biden diverged with his party numerous times to vote in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funds from being used to pay for abortions.)\n\nAnd while Biden has been intervening in primaries against progressive candidates, he has shown no appetite for using the most powerful office in the world to pressure the corporate holdouts in his party to help him protect abortion rights. That includes anti-choice Manchin, who even recently taped an ad bragging about blocking Biden's domestic agenda.\n\nDemocrats have further sabotaged their ability to reify reproductive rights by continuing to welcome antiabortion politicians into their caucus.\n\nFor example, Democratic House leaders - Speaker Nancy Pelosi (CA) , Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (MD) , and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (SC) are supporting the re-election bid of Texas representative Henry Cuellar, the last anti-choice Democrat in the House, against a progressive, pro-choice challenger. Clyburn is even scheduled to campaign with Cuellar Wednesday.\n\nIn 2017, Pelosi suggested that abortion was \"fading\" as a political issue, and insinuated that Democrats were too focused on the matter.\n\nThen there's the fact that Biden has appointed a Democrat who has undermined abortion access to his own cabinet. In January 2021, he appointed former Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo (D) as secretary of commerce. As governor, Raimondo negotiated a budget agreement that required some plans on the state insurance marketplace to exclude coverage for abortions.\n\n\"I don't think voters in Rhode Island really know what Governor Raimondo's done that has really violated the reproductive rights of women and threatened their health,\" former longtime NARAL Pro-Choice America leader Kate Michelman told UpriseRI about that deal. Michelman and Gloria Steinem, among other prominent abortion rights activists, endorsed Raimondo's primary opponent Matt Brown in 2018 due to her record on abortion rights.\n\nDespite Democrats squandering opportunities to protect reproductive rights, there's no reason they can't change right now. Biden can use his executive authority to improve abortion access, blue states can move to entrench abortion rights, and Democrats can take on the minoritarian institutions that are stripping away fundamental rights against popular will.\n\nBiden, for example, could use his sweeping executive powers to increase access to abortion. Yes, such a move could be overturned in the courts - but that development would represent an embarrassing about-face for the Roberts court.\n\nIn January, the court ruled in an unsigned opinion in Biden v. Missouri that the administration's vaccine mandate requirement for workers in health care settings was legal, saying :\n\nThe rule thus fits neatly within the language of the [law]. After all, ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm. It would be the \"very opposite of efficient and effective administration for a facility that is supposed to make people well to make them sick with COVID-19.\"\n\nThat language could be reasonably applied to an executive order from Biden mandating that virtually all hospitals with the capability to do so provide medically necessary abortions. All Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services providers - effectively all hospitals - could be bound by such an order. While the Hyde Amendment could present a difficulty, since it specifically bans the authorization of federal funds for abortion, nothing in its language limits the administration's ability to ensure abortion access.\n\nLess controversially, Biden could use the powers of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure access to the so-called \"abortion pill,\" mifepristone. He could do so by seeking to preempt state regulations that limit access to the pill, since drug approval is the FDA's sole domain.\n\nAt the state level, meanwhile, sixteen Democratic-controlled legislatures have moved to codify Roe into state law in recent years - but there is more they could do to expand access. Rhode Island, Delaware, and Nevada are the only three states with Democratic trifecta control or veto-proof legislative majorities that do not use state Medicaid funds to ensure abortion access. Those states could pass laws to do so, expanding coverage for low-income people seeking abortions.\n\nBlue states that already ensure Medicaid abortion coverage could also work to expand abortion access to people who will likely soon be arriving to access abortion and reproductive health care clinics within their borders.\n\nFor example, Illinois, which is surrounded by six red states set to enact sweeping abortion restrictions, could open public abortion clinics staffed by unionized state health care workers in towns and cities across the state. It could do so by leveraging its budget surplus of $444 million .\n\nBillionaire Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker (D) said Tuesday that\n\nno matter what atrocity of an opinion the Supreme Court officially rolls out this summer in regards to Roe v. Wade - - abortion will always be safe and legal here in Illinois. Illinois is and will remain a beacon of hope in an increasingly dark world.\n\nLikewise, Maryland could do the same as a gateway to the South where abortion rights restrictions will be rampant. While the state has a Republican governor, Democrats hold a supermajority in the legislature - and it has a \" huge \" budget surplus that is as high as $7.5 billion .\n\nStates could also provide modest assistance such as transportation, food, and lodging for those traveling from out of state to seek abortion care.\n\nCalifornia could provide similar support along its Arizona border, as could Washington and Oregon along their shared border with Idaho.\n\nWe reached out to top Democrats in California, Maryland, and Illinois to ask what steps they are willing to take to ensure access to abortion care. None returned a request for comment. In New York, meanwhile, Governor Kathy Hochul (D) recently thwarted a proposal to increase funding for women's health centers.\n\nFinally, there are important steps Democrats can take right now to chip away at minoritarian rule by the Right. After all, if ever there was a case for expanding the Supreme Court to make it more reflective of the public's desires, this is it. The approximately 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus has endorsed legislation to add four seats to the high court.\n\nMaybe the Roe v. Wade disaster will spur the party to action. The Washington Post said today that \"Democrats finally have something they have lacked in this perilous midterm election year: a compelling message.\"\n\nBut Democrats only need a new message because Biden and Democrats have failed to deliver on so many of their ambitious 2020 election promises. That includes implementing a public health insurance option to compete with abusive corporate insurers, aggressively investing in a green economy, passing a higher minimum wage, and expanding union rights.\n\nEven with this supposed midterm gift - one that comes with tragic consequences - Democrats face a massive uphill battle in the 2022 elections. The potential Republican rout could result in even more abortion restrictions, including in key states like Pennsylvania, where Governor Tom Wolf (D) is the only barrier against expansive abortion restrictions proposed by the Republican legislature.\n\nThat said, giving up is not an option. The recent union organizing win at Amazon's colossal Staten Island warehouse - and the multicentury campaign for women's bodily autonomy - prove that ordinary people do have the ability to make sweeping societal changes.\n\nPerhaps this unconscionable decision will finally wake a sleeping giant - or at least convince Democrats to come back home from brunch .\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nJulia Rock is a reporter for the Lever .\n\nMatthew Cunningham-Cook has written for Labor Notes , the Public Employee Press , Al Jazeera America, and the Nation .\n\nAndrew Perez is a writer and researcher living in Maine.\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

But rather than just stand by and watch the votes roll in, Democrats should run on a broader vision of reproductive freedom, including abortion access and economic policies to support families.\n\nAbortion-rights activists protest in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on June 24, 2024. (Aashish Kiphayet / Middle East Images / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDemocrats are counting on supporters of abortion rights to show up in big numbers this November and deliver them a victory. This election is, at least partially, a referendum on reproductive freedom, bodily, autonomy, and women's rights. It's a winning issue, and Democrats are finally ready to embrace it forcefully. If they had fought as hard for abortion access in the preceding decades as they promise to if they manage to hang onto the presidency, we might be in a different situation today. Still, we should see Kamala Harris's focus on reproductive rights as vice president and in the whirlwind first weeks of her presidential campaign, and her selection of the vocally pro-abortion Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate, as signs that pressure from reproductive-freedom advocates is having an effect.\n\nPro-choice activists cheered when Joe Biden stepped aside; as a practicing Catholic never shy to proclaim his moral opposition to abortion, he was forced into an uncomfortable role as the savior of reproductive rights in a post- Roe election season. During high-profile interviews , Biden frequently brought up his personal discomfort with abortion and avoided saying the word abortion during his State of the Union address. For the Democrats to go all in on abortion this election cycle with such a lukewarm supporter of reproductive rights at the top of the ticket felt like watching a slow-moving disaster.\n\nThe Biden administration did take some concrete steps to protect the few federal abortion protections remaining, including suing the state of Idaho for an abortion ban that denies abortion care to pregnant patients with medical emergencies in violation of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. In June, the Supreme Court declined to protect emergency abortion care and dismissed the case, temporarily allowing doctors in Idaho to provide emergency abortion care while the case returns to a federal district court.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has been on a reproductive-rights speaking tour this year, rallying people outraged at the overturning of Roe and repeating the talking point that Donald Trump's abortion bans are the cause of the suffering and fear of the past two years. She made national headlines (and infuriated antiabortion leaders) for being the first sitting vice president to visit an abortion clinic. As governor, Tim Walz joined in the public appearance at the Minnesota Planned Parenthood earlier this year.\n\nWalz is a strong and vocal supporter of reproductive rights and has supported efforts to ensure access to abortion in Minnesota in recent years. He signed the Minnesota PRO Act in January 2023, a law guaranteeing the right to abortion, birth control, and other reproductive health care. He also signed into law the Reproductive Freedom Defense Act, which shields abortion patients and providers from out-of-state legal or disciplinary actions for providing legal care; prohibits Minnesota agencies from enforcing out-of-state subpoenas, arrest warrants, and extradition requests; and protects patient records and privacy. The law was part of a package of safeguards for abortion and LGBTQ rights, including protections for gender-affirming care. Walz also ended a program that gave millions of dollars of state funding to antiabortion crisis pregnancy centers, and he talks openly about his own family's use of IVF to have their children.\n\nDespite these positive signs, leftists must continue to pressure Harris and elected Democrats to expand their horizons. It's not only reproductive health care that's necessary for communities to thrive, but also Medicare for All, universal childcare, more funding for public education, paid family leave, and a higher minimum wage - all demands of the reproductive-justice movement. For too long, advocates of popular and expansive goals to meaningfully support families and ensure access to all reproductive health care decisions have been met with derision and defensiveness by mainstream Democrats.\n\nAbortion can no longer be considered a third-rail issue, with politicians afraid to bring it up or make the connections between abortion access and economic issues. Now that Democrats have finally figured out that abortion is a winning electoral issue, it's up to reproductive-justice supporters to pressure our elected officials to advance the broadest progressive agenda and to ensure that they follow through on their campaign promises.\n\nThat means moving beyond the inadequate protections of Roe , which did not ensure abortion access for those who needed it most. In early August, over four hundred physicians providing sexual and reproductive health care signed onto a letter urging the Biden administration \"to broaden their efforts, moving beyond Roe 's framework, and talk about the future our patients deserve boldly and bravely. We ask you to champion policy solutions that are not premised on returning us to the narrow protections Roe created. We deserve so much more.\"\n\nIn Harris's August 6 rally in Pennsylvania, her language evolved from the \"restore Roe \" call that Biden popularized. Under her presidency, she said , \"we will restore reproductive freedom.\" This shift in language is an important indicator of the power and popularity of activists' demands for a broader definition of reproductive rights. Hopefully this means that Harris is moving beyond her previously stated goal of returning to the status quo under Roe . In a 2023 interview on Face the Nation , she said, \"We're not trying to do something new. We need to put into law the protections of Roe v. Wade , and that is about going back to where we were before the Dobbs decision.\"\n\nIf there was ever a moment to do something new and advocate for increased access to reproductive health care while working to end abortion stigma, it's right now. Popular support for abortion is at an all-time high, and one in eight voters say that abortion is the most important issue for their vote in the November election. In poll after poll , a majority of respondents want abortion to be legal in all or most cases. When the question is posed as one of government interference in reproductive health care decisions, support for abortion rights is even higher: in a March 2024 Axios/Ipsos poll , eight in ten people, including two-thirds of Republicans, agreed that the government shouldn't be involved in how a woman manages abortion issues.\n\nAs journalist Jessica Valenti points out , \"If Democrats want abortion to help them win this November, they must go on offense.\" We need bold ideas for expanding abortion access and ensuring that rights to reproductive health care are not tossed out under a future antiabortion president. The protections of Roe - which are obviously preferable to the current hellscape with near-total abortion bans in effect in more than a third of the country and a national ban advocated by Republicans - left too many people without access, and should not be the end goal.\n\nA right without access is meaningless, and access was frequently blocked by pre- Dobbs restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion, state restrictions on health insurance coverage of abortion, and onerous state regulations on abortion clinics that have led to many clinic closures. Roe did not ensure that everyone was able to make unencumbered decisions about their bodies and lives and was decided on flimsy legal arguments about a constitutional right to privacy that did not sufficiently advance or protect women's rights to autonomy and self-determination.\n\nDemocrats have momentum on abortion rights. They know the issue can turn out voters and is popular even in Republican-led states. Every time abortion rights have been on the ballot since Roe fell, they have won. This is the moment for Harris and the Democrats to take meaningful action on the economic factors that prevent many women from making the reproductive decisions that are best for them. To win over voters who care about abortion and gender equity, they need to make it clear what they will do to ensure abortion access and reproductive justice, and not just give lip service to abortion as a right that means nothing to those unable to access it.\n\nBeyond the inadequate calls to return to the protections of Roe v. Wade , Harris could call for expanded access to care by funding clinics and direct service providers, for ending the criminalization of pregnancy outcomes (especially for pregnant people of color), and for the repeal of the Comstock Act , a nineteenth-century anti-obscenity law that could function as a nationwide abortion ban. She could speak out about the harm of regulating abortion at any point, calling for abortion to be accessible and affordable for anyone, for any reason, at any stage of pregnancy.\n\nThe Democrats have the opportunity to take bold action to ensure access to reproductive health care without barriers or stigma and support families with progressive social policies. People's health and lives depend on their willingness to take advantage of the moment.\n\nAnne Rumberger is an activist with Chicago for Abortion Rights.

Wade and limit abortion access for tens of millions of Americans demonstrates a dispiriting level of apathy and ignorance.\n\nInstead of mobilizing voters to support abortion rights, the DNC's new digital ad campaign could mislead viewers into believing that the threat to abortion rights is still hypothetical and hasn't fully arrived at their doorsteps.\n\nPerhaps this messaging shouldn't come as a surprise, considering Democrats knew for seven weeks that the Supreme Court was ready to overturn Roe , yet they appeared completely unprepared for the decision when it came down last Friday. So far, party leaders have not offered any national strategy to ensure that people in red states can get abortions, outside of urging Americans to vote harder and deliver more contributions to their campaign committees.\n\nThe DNC started running its new ad on Wednesday, five days after the court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . So far, the ad has aired in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to data from AdImpact.\n\nAccording to a press release , the DNC is putting five figures behind the digital ad as part of its so-called \"MAGA Hot Mic\" campaign. The Hill reported that the \"ad buy will target 18- to 55-year-old women on Facebook and YouTube.\"\n\nA DNC spokesperson did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nThe DNC ad first gives the impression that the Supreme Court could soon overturn Roe , despite justices already having done so. It leads with video of former vice president Mike Pence (R) crowing, \"We may well be on the verge of an era when the Supreme Court sends Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history where it belongs.\"\n\nThe Pence video is from last November . The Supreme Court has already tossed Roe , with support from a dark money group founded by Pence. It's unclear why Democrats would use this quote from Pence given his prediction has already been realized - indeed, the ad could easily give some viewers the misleading impression that the court hasn't actually overturned Roe yet.\n\nNext, the ad pivots to warning that Republicans might try to impose a national abortion ban. This is a threat to be sure, but this ad is running in several states that already have abortion bans on the books, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Wisconsin. With the dismantling of Roe , the threat has already arrived in these states.\n\nAbortions are now mostly banned in Arizona, with no exceptions for rape or incest, unless necessary in an emergency to save a mother's life, according to Republican state attorney general Mark Brnovich. On Wednesday, Brnovich declared the state abortion law is back in effect now that Roe has been overturned.\n\nWisconsin has a nearly two-hundred-year-old abortion law on the books, which, similar to Arizona, makes no exceptions for rape or incest and only allows abortion to save a mother's life. This law is now in effect since Roe was overturned. According to the law, doctors who perform abortions could face up to six years in prison and $10,000 fines. Clinics in the state have stopped performing the procedure.\n\nWisconsin Democratic governor Tony Evers and attorney general Josh Kaul announced a lawsuit this week to block enforcement of the state ban, arguing that Wisconsin's post- Roe laws conflict with the 1849 law and that the ban has not been enforced for several decades.\n\n\"We're talking about returning Wisconsin to the nineteenth century. This law was passed well before women had the right to vote. It was passed before the Civil War,\" said Kaul in a news conference.\n\nThe DNC's muddled messaging extends beyond its ad campaigns and into its media talking points.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wispolitics.com published a DNC press release in which a committee spokesperson said, \"While Democrats work to ensure health care decisions stay between a woman and her doctor, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and across the country are signaling that bans with no exceptions for rape or incest are next on their extreme agenda.\"\n\nSuch a ban is already in effect in Wisconsin.\n\nThe DNC used similar language in its Florida statement, saying that \"Republican lawmakers in Florida and across the country are signaling that bans with no exceptions for rape or incest are next on their extreme agenda.\"\n\nFlorida passed an abortion law in April banning most abortions after fifteen weeks, including in cases of rape or incest. That law was set to take effect Friday, though it was halted by a judge on Thursday - at least temporarily.\n\nThe DNC ad is also running in Georgia, where Republicans passed a so-called \"fetal heartbeat\" law in 2019 banning most abortions at six weeks. The law, which includes exceptions in cases involving rape or incest or threatening the life of a mother, was blocked by a judge in July 2020.\n\nGeorgia Republicans are now requesting that an appeals court allow the law to take effect.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nAndrew Perez is senior editor and a reporter at the Lever covering money and influence.\n\nAditi Ramaswami is an associate editor at the Lever .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

There's no clearer sign that we should radically curb the power of the Supreme Court.\n\nPeople gather in protest against the leaked Supreme Court decision in Foley Square, New York, May 3, 2022.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBefore James Bopp led the fight to deregulate campaign finance law that culminated in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010, the conservative lawyer had another role: general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, the country's largest national anti-abortion group.\n\nBopp's two interests - flooding the electoral system with undisclosed sources of cash and policing women's bodily autonomy - converged earlier this week after the leak of a draft opinion signaled the imminent end of Roe v. Wade . The tentative majority in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was signed by five conservative justices, three of whom are direct products of the Right's dark-money-fueled judicial network, and four of whom were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote.\n\nThe plutocratic funding that built up the modern conservative legal movement and effectively produced this anti-majoritarian decision lays bare the antidemocratic core of the court - and the urgency of divesting the robed nine of their extraordinary power.\n\nThe leaked opinion, written by Samuel Alito, an appointee of George W. Bush (a president who lost the popular vote and entered the White House as a result of Bush v. Gore , a 5-4 stamp of approval from an ideologically split court), would overturn the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade and its judicial clarifier, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), both of which relied on broad constitutional interpretations of privacy and personal liberty.\n\n\"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" writes Alito in the ninety-eight-page draft. \"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey chiefly rely: the Due Process Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nPaying no heed to years of precedent and considerable public support for abortion rights, Alito relies on a constrained, formalistic version of the founding document that protects only the rights \"'deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition,' and 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.'\" This reactionary view of rights holds under the knife not only access to abortion but other ostensibly settled liberties that broad swaths of the electorate have come to accept, embrace, and rely upon.\n\n\"Justice Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs is a radical repudiation of the Court's earlier libertarian precedents on abortion,\" Samuel Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Toledo, told Jacobin . \"But [the decision] goes much further than that to suggest that all rights seen in earlier cases as fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause like the right to contraception, same-sex marriage, interracial marriage, freedom from forced sterilization, and the right to educate one's children are now subject to reversal.\"\n\nIf the Supreme Court is left unchecked, it will continue to advance the interests of right-wing groups and roll back popular gains.\n\nIn Planned Parenthood v. Casey , Alito's conservative forebearer, Antonin Scalia, argued in dissent that it was wrong for the court to rule on the contentious issue of abortion, insisting instead that \"the permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.\" Decades later, Alito echoed this argument, writing in Dobbs that \"it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\"\n\nDemocratic Party leaders also invoked the voters in their response to the leaked decision. In a statement, President Joe Biden said: \"If the Court does overturn Roe . . . it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. . . . At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe .\"\n\nPutting aside the inanity of conservative justices posing as fans of electoral democracy - Scalia and Alito personally helped gut the Voting Rights Act - the voter solution to the judicial problem falls short. A clear majority of voters have long opposed overturning Roe v. Wade , yet America's anti-majoritarian political institutions have prevented the ruling from being incorporated into law. Just this year, a measure to codify Roe was passed in the House, only to stall in the Senate in the face of the filibuster (and conservative Democrat Joe Manchin). Nor should we trust Biden or the Democratic Party, which has proven much better at using the specter of a reactionary court to bludgeon left critics than actually safeguarding abortion rights.\n\nInstead of pushing a purely electoral solution, we should advocate a wholesale restructuring of the court and its place in American politics.\n\nAs legal scholar Samuel Moyn wrote in his testimony last year to the presidential committee on court reform:\n\nThe problem to solve is not that the Supreme Court has lost legitimacy, understood as the current trust of enough observers, but that it thwarts the democratic authority that alone justifies our political arrangements. It is one thing to insulate and protect interpreters of our Constitution and laws from certain kinds of short-term democratic control. It is quite another to cede the last word over large parts of our national political conversation - not to mention the power to edit and throw out major laws - to less accountable powers and, to add insult to injury, to pretend that doing so is either mandated by our Constitution or essential to democracy.\n\nMoyn suggests disempowering the court by stripping the body of its jurisdiction or requiring that only a supermajority of justices could overrule an act of Congress. Another reform proposal, advocated by legal scholar Jamal Greene, would curb the \"disproportionate amount of power each individual justice wields\" by expanding the court to include each appellate judgeship on the federal bench.\n\nWhatever the precise solution, after the leak of an opinion that would gut precedent upon broadly popular precedent and harm the health and bodily autonomy of millions of people, it is now glaringly obvious that the court cannot continue in its current form. We must plunder the court's power.\n\nBenjamin Morse is a writer who focuses on the Left and the law.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Wade - contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of the population and the individual rights of millions of people.\n\nDemonstrators attend a rally in support of abortion rights on May 3, 2022 in Seattle, Washington. (David Ryder / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nA leaked draft decision written by Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito suggests it's all but certain Roe v. Wade is about to be overturned. The ruling will immediately make abortion illegal in half the country , and commentators have noted the decision seems designed to encourage Republicans to push for an abortion ban at the national level .\n\nThe ruling, which will restrict the autonomy and fundamental rights of tens of millions of women, will be enacted by four or five unelected men and one unelected woman. Such a decision can only be described as authoritarian. (There is some speculation Chief Justice John Roberts might not join the other Republican justices in supporting Alito's decision.)\n\nIf the decision stands, it will be a high-water mark for the Right's project of undemocratic rule, and will almost certainly give conservatives confidence to further attack democratic institutions and individual rights. As the draft decision shows, the Supreme Court is arguably the most powerful weapon the Right has for ruling without and against the people.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court is especially insulated from democracy and accountability, this authoritarian impulse has always been at the core of conservatism , and the Right has always had a tenuous relationship to democracy. Historically , it has only acceded to democratic demands kicking and screaming , and it has consistently tried to roll back democratic practices and revert power to unaccountable elites .\n\nAs I wrote in December, this project has accelerated significantly since the rise of Donald Trump, both in rhetoric and substance. While the desire to overturn Roe v. Wade long precedes Donald Trump's presidency, Alito's decision is best understood in the context of the broader counter-democratic movement that has been picking up steam for the past seven years.\n\nSo far, the Right has generally refrained from directly calling for less democracy; nor has it given up on trying to win popular support, especially when it has a virtually unlimited pot of dark money to run elections and to advance the candidacies of Supreme Court justices themselves. Instead, conservatives frame themselves as the true champions of democracy and the victims of cheating or \"illegitimate\" voters when they lose votes, a tactic the Court itself deployed when it handed George W. Bush the presidency in 2000.\n\nUsing these false claims of foul play as a pretext, conservatives then move to restrict access to democratic decision-making to those groups that support them, while making it more difficult for their opponents to vote, assemble , or even teach basic elements of American history. Finally, conservatives push decision-making to those institutions they have already captured through a mix of democratic and undemocratic means. There is little consistency as to why one government entity or another is the proper one to make the decision in question, except that the one conservatives control is always the right one.\n\nAlito's decision plays into this dynamic. He writes , \" Roe and Casey must be overruled and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\" Here is the characteristic appeal to democracy, which of course makes no mention of the extensive gerrymandering the GOP has used to all but ensure itself long-term rule despite its diminishing democratic support. Nor does Alito mention the extensive voter suppression the party has engaged in, and which the Supreme Court itself has enthusiastically supported .\n\nThanks to the Right's gerrymandering, voter suppression, and campaign finance tactics, many of which accelerated dramatically after favorable rulings from the Supreme Court over the past decade, access to abortion will be greatly restricted by elected officials - which Alito surely knows. This will happen despite wide margins of Americans supporting legal abortion in all or some circumstances, and 59 percent saying that absent Roe , they want state abortion laws that are \"more permissive than restrictive.\"\n\nThere is no reason to think this will get any better, or to expect another outcome when it comes to other important issues. The six Republican Supreme Court justices are among the most powerful right-wing operatives in the country. It's silly to pretend they are anything else, expect logical or legal consistency, or argue with them in the press as if reason will change their mind.\n\nThere is a special sense of helplessness here. Anyone who pays even a little bit of attention to politics knows exactly what will happen, and knows that no one will stop it. The justices will surely continue to find reasons to strike down popular legislation and regulations that were enacted by \"the people and their elected representatives,\" just as surely as they will find reasons to return questions of individual liberty, voting rights, and freedom of assembly and expression to state governments dominated by conservative extremists sure to restrict them. The legal arguments are bluster and finely written sophistry. It's all just motivated reasoning for raw power: they're all for democracy, as long as they can first guarantee that they'll win.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But while the news is shocking, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that no single person was responsible for the partial victory of Roe - it takes collective action to win social change.\n\nNorma McCorvey, left, who was Jane Roe in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case, with her attorney, Gloria Allred, outside the Supreme Court in April 1989.\nLorie Shaull / Wikimedia\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nNorma McCorvey, the Texas plaintiff whose abortion case made it to the Supreme Court as Roe v. Wade in 1973, very publicly turned against abortion in 1995, speaking and writing against it prominently for twenty years. She died in 2017. Now, in AKA Jane Roe , a documentary filmed during the last year of her life, McCorvey says she only campaigned against abortion because she was paid by right-to-lifers, and that she supports abortion rights.\n\n\"I was the big fish,\" she told director Nick Sweeney of her recruitment by an anti-abortion pastor. \"I think it was a mutual thing. I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That's what I'd say.\" The filmmakers were able to find evidence of $456,911 in payments.\n\nIf you've spent some time in the movement, you've seen this happen. An effective but cash-strapped grassroots leader abruptly stops speaking out and soon buys a house. A politician starts out championing labor rights and ends up championing corporate rights.\n\nAmong these ordinary sellouts, McCorvey was an overachiever. She went from being an abortion rights activist, working at a clinic and living with her girlfriend, to getting baptized by an anti-abortion, anti-gay evangelical Christian pastor in a backyard swimming pool. Three years later she converted again, to Catholicism. Before a Senate subcommittee in 1998 she said she was \"dedicated to spending the rest of my life undoing the law that bears my name.\"\n\nEstablishment media often smear leftists as \"professional protesters.\" But mercenaries and scammers have always been more prevalent on the Right. The anti-abortion movement is exceptionally well-funded, from Koch-supplied lobbyists to tax-free church slush funds used to crank out books and movies and establish thousands of \"Crisis Pregnancy Centers\" (which outnumber real abortion clinics in some states forty to one). They have the money to purchase loyalty, if someone is willing to sell.\n\nMcCorvey was the unnamed plaintiff \"Jane Roe\" in the abortion suit filed against Texas in 1970 by two young feminist lawyers, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee. They were challenging the state law, typical at the time, that made it illegal to have an abortion unless your life was in danger. They needed a plaintiff who couldn't afford to travel to get an abortion, someone who was unambiguously oppressed by the Texas law. In 1969, McCorvey was cashless, in her third pregnancy, and had already given one child up for adoption. Her first child, the product of an abusive marriage at sixteen, was being raised by her mother. She signed an affidavit saying that she wanted an abortion in a safe clinical setting and couldn't afford to travel. The suit was filed in March 1970.\n\nBut the court's decision didn't come in time for her. McCorvey recalled the 1973 phone call from Weddington announcing they had won. \"Why would I be excited? I had a baby, but I gave her away,\" she said. \"It's for all the women who come after me.\" McCorvey stayed anonymous until the 1980s, when she became publicly active for abortion rights. She even attended the oral arguments in the Supreme Court's Webster case in 1989 with Weddington. Many thought the court would overturn Roe outright, allowing states to once again ban abortion. But thanks to large demonstrations and general outcry, the court only weakened it. McCorvey's media appearances sparked death threats and, on one occasion, a shotgun blast through the window of her home.\n\nIn 1995, McCorvey was working at a Dallas abortion clinic under siege from the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue when she was \"befriended\" and then \"converted' by an anti-abortion evangelical minister. The church she joined was anti-gay, so she ended her relationship with her long-time girlfriend, Connie Gonzalez, though they kept living together (an odd move if she was pretending). McCorvey became a fixture at anti-abortion protests and penned a memoir of her conversion, Won by Love . In 2005 she filed a petition at the Supreme Court seeking to overturn Roe , and seven years later she made an anti-Obama ad, saying \"Do not vote for Barack Obama . . . he murders babies.\"\n\nApparently she kept the money flowing by privately wavering. Former Operation Rescue leader Rob Shenck, who later renounced the anti-abortion movement, tells the filmmakers that they worried she might defect, so she was paid to keep her on their side. When shown McCorvey's statement about being paid, Flip Benham, the unrepentant swimming pool baptizer, explodes: \"Yeah, but she chose to be used. That's called work, that's what you're paid to be doing!\"\n\nThis pathetic dance of fraud and exploitation is summarized by Schenck: \"There were times I wondered, is she playing us? ... I knew damn well we were playing her.\" He concludes, \"When you do what we did to Norma, you lose your soul.\" Evidently, she didn't escape unharmed either. She constructs herself as a cold, in-control mercenary in the film, though it's clear that's not the whole story. \"I'm a good actress,\" she tells Sweeney, and then, realizing this might be interpreted as just more bullshit: \"Of course I'm not acting now.\"\n\nSo what are we to make of McCorvey's \"deathbed confession\" as she calls it? Turns out - and I suspect she would hate this - it's not about her. She's neither \"responsible for the deaths of 58 million babies,\" as the anti-abortion right would have it, nor is she the cause of legal abortion in the United States.\n\n\"Jane Roe\" was a legal proxy for all the Texas women who wanted abortions but couldn't obtain them; her suit was a class action \"on behalf of herself and all other women similarly situated.\" More than a dozen similar cases were making their way through the courts at the time, the product of a powerful Women's Liberation Movement that produced illegal abortion referral services on every campus and held marches against male supremacy in every city. As Weddington wrote in her 1992 memoir , the victory was \"the combined efforts of countless individuals.\" She characterizes it as \"a series of quirks\" that made her, and McCorvey, famous.\n\nFocusing on individuals may make compelling copy, in other words, but it creates the illusion that change is the province of superheroes rather than ordinary people engaging in collective action. This generates enormous pressure on individuals picked out by history, celebrated and reviled as a symbol of much larger forces.\n\nAttributing the partial victory of Roe - a compromise with what feminists had been campaigning for, full repeal of all abortion laws and free abortion on demand - to the plaintiff, lawyers, or court also ignores the context in which the women's liberation movement was able to advance. The establishment was weakened by a near-hysteria about high birth rates, both in the United States and abroad. While this quickly dissipated in the mid-1970s, at the time of Roe it split the establishment, including the Republican Party, on the question of birth control and abortion.\n\nAdditionally, the United States looked embarrassingly backward: women in the Soviet Union and elsewhere were able to get abortions freely, while the capitalist \"free world\" forced them into an underground of butchers. In the Cold War argument over who had freedom, the United States was losing points.\n\nAs AKA Jane Roe points out, McCorvey wasn't the demure, reputable plaintiff the newly professionalizing abortion movement could use to appeal to their well-heeled funding base, so by the 1990s, she was sidelined. (The matching political strategy, also pitched to donors, has increasingly emphasized the \"deserving\" abortion cases - rape victims, cases of fatal fetal deformity, or cancer.)\n\nIndividual plaintiffs who brought suits all over the country in 1969 and 1970 have been shuffled aside in favor of arguments that appeal to doctors' right to practice and clinics' right to operate. The Supreme Court case names tell the tale: Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, Whole Women's Health vs. Hellerstedt , and the Louisiana case currently before the court, June Medical Services v. Russo . When the American Civil Liberties Union filed Chelius v. Azar , a 2017 suit to get rid of unnecessary Federal Drug Administration restrictions on abortion pills, it was on behalf of a doctor in Hawaii, Graham Chelius, rather than his patients.\n\nNo doubt McCorvey's defection to the anti-abortion side contributed to this trend, but individual women going to court has been a successful strategy in some cases. The winning suit against the FDA to make the Morning After Pill over the counter for all ages in 2013 involved nine individual plaintiffs (of which I was one).\n\nRichard Hearn, who successfully sued Idaho to overturn its law against self-abortion on behalf of Jennie McCormack, noted, \"Many advocates for women's rights appear to want women's real stories and their real-life troubles out of courts. They want plaintiffs to be MD/PhDs from Yale or Harvard. You don't see women in abortion cases. You see doctors arguing in coats and ties.\"\n\nHearn defended McCormack after she was arrested for ending a twenty-week pregnancy with pills she obtained online. She faced five years in prison. After winning that case, she sued Idaho and overturned not only the 1972 law that made self-abortion illegal, she also invalidated an Idaho twenty-week limit on abortions. Yet McCormack, a single mother of three who was caught because she didn't know what to do with the aborted fetus (the ground was frozen at the time, so she wrapped it and put it on her porch) would not have made the ideal plaintiff. No one is.\n\nJenny Brown is a member of National Women's Liberation and a former editor at Labor Notes .

We need an abortion rights movement that organizes beyond individual elections and fights for reproductive freedom as part of a federal universal health plan.\n\nProtesters gather in Washington Square Park in New York City following the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court, June 24, 2022. (Alex Kent / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the wake of yesterday's anticipated but crushing Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade , Jacobin columnist Ben Burgis spoke to socialist writer and organizer Lillian Cicerchia about how to build a successful abortion rights movement in the United States. Their conversation , which appeared on Burgis's YouTube show, Give Them an Argument , has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat is the landscape after the Supreme Court decision?\n\nWhat's coming is a world that's geographically segregated in terms of access to reproductive health care services.\n\nIt's already like that to some extent. There are many blue states, like New York, that have a constitutionally guaranteed right to abortion. In red states, they have whittled down abortion access to the point where it's illegal, or legal in a very circumscribed way. Abortion will become simply illegal, or inaccessible, in those states.\n\nThere are a lot of places in which people will not be able to get abortions, and people will have to travel really long distances. Many do already. If you live in South Dakota right now, there's one abortion clinic in the state, and you have to driving for hours and hours to get these services. That's just going to become worse.\n\nSo it's going to be an exacerbated version of what already exists. Things have been deteriorating for so long that, for a lot of people, the post- Roe world is the status quo.\n\nRight. So the harder question is, what can we do about it?\n\nI think the only way to win abortion rights is through a health care campaign that unapologetically defends abortion rights. There are different ways of articulating that defense, but I think that campaign for universal health care is the only way to go over, or go against, this kind of state-by-state morass.\n\nThe other important reason is that the 1976 Hyde Amendment has restricted public funding for abortions unless states approve it. So in many red states, people cannot get abortions through federal money. This restriction has been going on since the '70s, and it created a class-segregated reproductive health system from the beginning.\n\nThe only way to lift those restrictions is to have a universal program at the federal level. State-by-state health care schemes are not going to fix this problem.\n\nI would also suggest - and this is a more aspirational thing - a reproductive health care bill of rights as a way of packaging abortion health into a universal health care system.\n\nWhat else would be in there, in addition to abortion rights?\n\nProvisions against forced sterilization and any kind of reproductive compulsions or pressures. Patients have a bill of rights, and a reproductive health care bill of rights should be consistent with the kind of thing health care providers are already doing. But there's a history of abuse in the United States, and people being coerced because of poverty into making decisions.\n\nPeople should be provided with the full range of options. In the United States, we have this health care system where you just go in and they often give you drugs or whatever to try to solve your problem - they don't really take the time to give you the full range of options of the kind of care you need, what your goals are, what your plans are, what your background is. I live in Germany now, and when I go to the OB-GYN, I get extremely thorough exams and pamphlets that make sure you know what you're doing. That's not really the way people experience health care in the United States, and it's certainly not the way they experience reproductive health care. So changes in the qualitative nature of care need to happen in order to secure people's rights.\n\nThe second thing is that this can't just be an electoral strategy. There has to be a movement of health care workers and of independent feminist organizations that can pressure nonprofits and more progressive Democrats to enact legislation. It is not possible to address this problem with election campaigning alone.\n\nWhat kind of movement would be able to build the broad-based support you'd need to secure abortion rights?\n\nThere's a combination of tactics, and it's going to depend on the area. Some people see the mass women's demonstrations for abortion rights in Latin America as one thing to look at - people have public assemblies where they get organized independently of mainstream institutions. I don't know how successful that would be in the United States, but given the number of people that come out to demonstrate, it's worthwhile to see if something more grassroots can put together committees that are willing to work on a health care campaign. I also think doing direct action like defending clinics is important.\n\nPeople who live in blue states should reach out to people who are under siege in red states, and do so with more than just donations. It might be possible to coordinate cross-state action, both in terms of providing direct services and doing demonstrations. In a way, it's a civil rights issue, and I've always wondered if it would be possible to organize, with the consent and collaboration of people in the South, freedom rides. We could attend clinics and bring resources and voice verbal support at important demonstrations or occupations at capitol buildings.\n\nBut something beyond simply getting people to vote is deeply necessary. And I think there are a number of tactics that you don't have to pull out of your hat. People have experience with defending clinics and doing escorts, even running underground operations to get people to point A to point B, and putting pressure on the medical system. They did it once, and I think we can do it again, but it has to be on a better basis. It has to be on the basis of health care and positive rights and not just \"negative\" liberties like the freedom to choose to have an abortion and the privacy of the decision with your doctor.\n\nThat's really the problem with Roe : abortion was legalized on a very narrow basis, and all of the problems of class and racial segregation that happened in terms of access were entirely predictable based on the compromises that occurred as a result of that narrow basis.\n\nSo the job of the Left is to be ecumenical in tactics, but to take an offensive approach for something good - as opposed to only electing Democrats and having a defensive strategy that tries to fight off the Right in the courts. That hasn't worked. It's not going to work any better in the future. And Democrats are increasingly unwilling to do that anyway.\n\nIn terms of fighting for something good, and also in terms of contrast between the United States and Germany, I wonder if there's a good way to present that unapologetic defense of reproductive rights in combination with support for state-funded day care, financial support for young parents, and an overall vision of what we think counts as a meaningful choice - you know, a broader, more socialist conception of rights.\n\nI agree - a right to have children in a safe and healthy environment as much as the right to not have children. We want to have institutions that allow people and families, if they choose to have them, to flourish.\n\nIn Germany, the state actually won't pay for you to get an abortion; it's only legal up until twelve weeks, and you have to be referred to an abortion provider through a counseling service. So you can't directly access abortion health care yourself. This is part of the compromise made with the Christian Democrats, and so there's a lot of restrictions that created a stable equilibrium. On the one hand, there's no right wing challenging abortion rights, but on the other hand, if you talk to German feminists, they will tell you there are a lot of problems.\n\nThe right contrast, the place with the most expansive abortion-rights policies in Europe, is the Netherlands. They also have the lowest rate of abortions per capita. Not that this matters to me morally, to be clear. I think there should be as many abortions as women who want them, but it does show that having well-rounded sexual education, an abundance of social services, and unrestricted access to an abortion does in fact decrease the likelihood that people will be coerced into undesirable choices with their sexual and reproductive freedoms.\n\nSo places like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain are not the model. There are even more egalitarian setups.\n\nLillian Cicerchia is a postdoctoral researcher in philosophy at the Free University of Berlin, with a focus on political economy, feminism, and critical theory.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Morehouse College, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

The response from Democrats should be obvious: skirt the Supreme Court and demand federal legislation codifying the right to abortion.\n\nAn activist speaks outside the Supreme Court in protest against a Texas abortion law that prohibits the procedure from six weeks into a pregnancy on September 2, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAbortion looks set to be illegal in half the country within weeks. Politico obtained a leaked draft of the upcoming Supreme Court decision in which Justice Samuel Alito argues that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision found a right to abortion in the constitution that was never there. The decision would overrule both Roe and the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision that upheld the abortion rights Roe established.\n\nDemonstrations defending the right to abortion are planned at federal courthouses across the country.\n\nThe final decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization isn't expected until June, but if the leaked draft holds, states will be permitted to ban abortion, and at least half are likely to do so. A dozen states already have trigger laws in place that will automatically ban the procedure as soon as the Court allows it. And 58 percent of US women of childbearing age live in states with hostile legislatures.\n\nThe decision will force hundreds of thousands of women and others who need abortions to scramble to try to get to states in which the procedure is legal, or to procure abortion pills and procedures clandestinely. Those without adequate resources will be forced to carry pregnancies to term and give birth against their will, a form of torture. In states where abortion is illegal, those who perform abortions will be arrested, and those who have abortions will be interrogated and jailed if they refuse to talk.\n\nThe new decision would sic cops on doctors and trigger punitive measures against women who obtain abortions. Oklahoma recently passed legislation that would provide ten years in prison and up to $100,000 in fines for performing an abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion forces piously promise that women getting abortions would never be subject to arrest, only those terrible abortionists - a bold lie given that women are already being arrested. A woman in Texas was charged with murder in March for allegedly giving herself an abortion. Charges were only dropped after a national outcry. Around twenty-five women have been prosecuted in the United States for their miscarriages over the last decades. Until she won a reprieve, Purvi Patel was sentenced to twenty years in prison for concealing her late miscarriage. Jennie Lynn McCormack in Idaho used abortion pills and was sentenced to five years in prison. She appealed and managed to get her conviction and the law overturned.\n\nCases like these have generally been won on appeal as the homicide and feticide statutes used were found to be inappropriate. But that's only because, up until now, states couldn't classify abortion as murder. Soon, they'll be free to bring such charges against doctors and patients.\n\nA lot of pro-choice rhetoric suggests that women are going to be dragged back to a time before Roe v. Wade enshrined the right to abortion. In fact, the legal situation in the 1960s is not a particularly good guide for what we will see next. The United States has become much more of a police state since then, with mass incarceration and heavy sentences that outstrip all other countries. The United States has 33 percent of the world's female prison population.\n\nWhile the carceral state has expanded, medical technology has also advanced since the 1960s, when five thousand women a year were estimated to have died from unsafe illegal abortions. Serious complications were so common that whole hospital wards had to be dedicated to botched abortion cases.\n\nNowadays, doctors who study self-abortion say that attempts to abort with sharp objects, blunt trauma, and poisons are much less prevalent because abortion pills have become more available on the gray market and from overseas providers such as Aid Access . And the Food and Drug Administration recently loosened restrictions on abortion pills to make them available by mail in states that allow them.\n\nAbortion pills are safe and effective, and they are currently used in more than half of medically supervised abortions. But while those who use abortion pills are safe medically, they will not be safe from anti-abortion state laws and prosecutors bent on terrorizing people as a deterrent to the use of pills.\n\nIn the leaked draft decision, Alito writes: \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\" This sounds great in theory, and abortion supporters themselves have even made this argument. Large majorities of people in the United States (between 60 and 72 percent) support Roe v. Wade , so a healthy legislative system would have long since made abortion legal through federal law . But ours is moribund.\n\nIn September, anticipating a Supreme Court bloodbath, Democrats in the US House passed the Women's Health Protection Act , a law codifying the rights enumerated in Roe . A Senate vote defeated the act 46-48. Two Republican senators who allegedly support abortion rights, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, voted against the bill, citing quibbles with its language. But even if they had voted for it, the filibuster rule means that forty-one senators can nix anything, and they no longer have to make long speeches or wear adult diapers to do so.\n\nShort of abolishing the Senate altogether - most democracies have unicameral legislatures - it would certainly help to get rid of the filibuster rule . Not just abortion but a host of vital bills are being held hostage by the party out of power, from climate change legislation to a higher minimum wage to union rights.\n\nHaving been unable to pass most legislation that would actually help communities pillaged by corporations and oppressed by right-wing state legislatures, Senate Democrats are now set to use the issue of abortion to try to gin up support in the midterm elections. But even if a massive popular uprising on this issue allows Democrats to hold on to the Senate, unless they abolish the filibuster rule, a law protecting abortion access has no chance. What can they promise us tomorrow that they can't deliver today?\n\nIt's time for Democrats to defend democracy and make abortion legal throughout the country.\n\nJenny Brown is a member of National Women's Liberation and a former editor at Labor Notes .

And Democrats won't save us - we need to fight back with a mass movement in the streets that boldly pushes for reproductive justice.\n\nMaya Rezemde Tsao, Shelby Pullen, and Julia Glassen, all holding hangers, chant in unison as abortion rights demonstrators gather in front of the Supreme Court of the United States on May 3, 2022, in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAccording to an initial draft majority opinion that was leaked on Monday, the Supreme Court's conservative majority decided in a preliminary vote to strike down the constitutional right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade in 1973.\n\nIt's a crushing blow to the abortion rights movement, but it's not the end of the fight. Going forward, we will need to rethink our strategies and brace for the hard battles ahead.\n\nThe draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, takes a hard-line position against the constitutional right to abortion, saying that states can criminalize abortion with no exceptions for rape and incest. \"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" writes Alito. \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\"\n\nTwenty-six states are likely to ban abortion without the protections of Roe , according to the Guttmacher Institute . Republican-led states have been placing restrictions on abortion access for years but have been especially emboldened since the Supreme Court took on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case deciding on the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law that banned abortion after fifteen weeks of pregnancy. States enacted more than a hundred abortion restrictions in 2021 alone, with another thirty-three enacted in 2022 as of April 15.\n\nThe antiabortion laws that have been passed in red states just the last few years give us a window into the intentions of conservative legislatures. In Texas, SB 8 allows any private citizen anywhere in the country to sue anyone who performs an abortion or \"aids or abets\" anyone seeking an abortion in the state after an embryo's cardiac activity can be detected, often around six weeks into a pregnancy. Abortions in Texas dropped nearly 60 percent in the first month that the country's most restrictive abortion law was in effect. Since then, at least seven states have introduced bills mimicking the Texas antiabortion law. Tennessee recently captured headlines proposing a bill that would ban all abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and allow a rapist's relatives to sue abortion providers. In April, Oklahoma Republican governor Kevin Stitt signed a near-total abortion ban into law, which threatens prison for providers.\n\nAll of that has happened with Roe in place. When it's overturned, all bets are off.\n\nThings are about to get very difficult for people seeking abortions, especially for those whose life options are already constrained. Access to abortion is already limited for poor people, people of color, and residents of rural areas. The end of Roe will mean more pain, suffering, and violence for the most marginalized women. Those seeking and providing abortion care in conservative-led states are already being targeted and criminalized; without the protections of Roe , the most vulnerable will be open to even more criminalization . Furthermore, poor people and people of color are most likely to suffer from complications caused by being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies, exacerbated by unequal access to health care and racial inequities in the medical system; in 2020, the maternal mortality rate for black women was almost three times higher than for white women.\n\nRepublicans will not stop at overturning Roe . Their true goal is to enact a nationwide six-week abortion ban , and fetal personhood bills to give fetuses equal rights to pregnant people, or even privileged rights. And it won't stop at abortion, despite assurances in Alito's draft that \"nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nRight now Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House. They should respond to the court's decision by attempting to pass federal legislation codifying the right to abortion. It will require ending the filibuster, which won't be easy, but if the Democrats want to be known as the party of abortion rights, then they will have to make the attempt.\n\nThat might be a tall order, though, as Democrats are unreliable in their actual commitments to abortion rights. For example, Democrats and Republicans alike have long supported the Hyde Amendment, which bans most federal funding for abortion through programs like Medicaid. It took Joe Biden until 2019 to take a public stance in opposition to the Hyde Amendment.\n\nWe can pressure Democratic politicians to support reproductive rights, but we cannot rely on them for the leadership we need when so much is at stake. Instead, we'll need to provide leadership ourselves - and that means revisiting and updating the strategies of the abortion rights movement.\n\nRoe v. Wade declared that women's right to privacy gave them a constitutional right to abortion during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. The majority of Supreme Court justices are considered originalists with ties to the Federalist Society, and in Alito's draft opinion he states that the right to privacy does not provide the constitutional right to abortion. It's possible that other established rights based on privacy could be next on the chopping block, perhaps including the right to engage in private consensual sexual activity and access to birth control and contraception.\n\nHorrifying as that prospect is, it can provide a roadmap for how to broaden and build the power of the abortion rights movement. The wave of attacks on LGBTQ rights, especially those of trans youth, are being supported by the same conservative politicians and fundamentalist lobbyists behind the most restrictive abortion bans. To fight such an organized movement of economic and social conservatives, abortion supporters need to recognize the interconnectedness of current struggles and expand our movement to include activists fighting for universal health care, LGBTQ rights, and an end to mass incarceration and police brutality.\n\nWe should also revisit the position that abortion is a private choice, framing that has long been embraced by the mainstream reproductive rights movement. The right to privacy is not only a shaky constitutional foundation for abortion but also insufficiently firm ground to build a political movement on. Organizing a mass movement in support of privacy rights and individual choice has not worked. Ceding the political terrain around abortion has made it exceedingly difficult to break down the shame and stigma associated with reproductive health care decisions, making it even easier for antiabortion religious conservatives to gain political power and influence public opinion.\n\nMany people have no real choice when it comes to abortion; state restrictions, a lack of providers in rural areas, and high health care costs limit access for millions of people and also limit \"choice\" as an organizing framework for a mass movement for reproductive freedom. It's time to let go of choice as our organizing framework and focus on access and justice instead.\n\nThe leaked document is a draft opinion - the final opinion will likely not come until June or early July. As of now, abortion is still legal. But we can't wait until Roe is officially struck down. We should immediately take to the streets to demand free and equal access to abortion. We need to support the work of reproductive justice organizations , providers at independent abortion clinics, and abortion funds who have been sounding the alarm for years about the lack of reproductive health care access for poor and working-class people.\n\nGoing forward, we will be more reliant on self-managed abortion and sending abortion pills by mail. As for surgical abortion services, we will need to support organizations that help people traveling to abortion-friendly states to receive care. Find your local abortion fund and donate what you can, and share info on local funds with your friends and followers.\n\nMost importantly, take to the streets, not just once but over and over again until the message is clear and impossible to ignore. We cannot rely on politicians, the courts, or the mainstream nonprofits to defend the right to abortion. We can only rely on each other, and we can't give up the fight.\n\nAnne Rumberger is an activist with NYC for Abortion Rights and NYC Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "How Harris Could Go Beyond Roe\n\nKamala Harris at a Fight For Reproductive Freedoms event in San Jose, Calif. Justin Sullivan/Getty\n\nThe contrast between the intentions of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on reproductive rights could not be clearer-no matter how much Trump tries to suggest otherwise.\n\nTrump appointed three of the five Supreme Court justices who overruled Roe v. Wade and has famously flip-flopped on his stances on abortion. Back in 2016, for example, he briefly floated the idea of punishing women who get abortions, but then, following public outcry even from some anti-abortion groups, his campaign walked that back. At his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris last month, he twice refused to say whether or not he would veto a federal abortion ban if Congress passed one-and then claimed earlier this month that he would. And in August, Trump appeared to suggest he would vote to expand abortion rights on the ballot measure in Florida , where he maintains his Mar-a-Lago estate and where abortion is currently banned at six weeks' gestation; just a day later, he reversed course following backlash from the anti-abortion crowd.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, has consistently campaigned as a vocal supporter of abortion rights. She has highlighted the fallout of the overruling of Roe for women in need of abortion care, and warned about the likelihood of Republicans' passing a national abortion ban if Trump is reelected. In her presidential campaign, she has promised voters her administration would pass a law that would \"restore reproductive freedom.\"\n\nBut there's a problem, even should she win. Any hope for such a law depends on Democrats winning control of Congress, which looks unlikely. (When confronted about this, Harris has called for ending the filibuster to make it easier for such legislation to pass.) For some advocates, the promises Harris makes also lack any details of what protections she would support and how her policies would move beyond Roe -if at all.\n\nRoe was \"the ultimate floor, and not the ceiling, of what we need for making abortion affordable and accessible for all who need it,\" Nourbese Flint, president of the advocacy group All* Above All, told me. Under Roe, states were still permitted to restrict abortion access after the point of so-called fetal viability, and it did not protect women from criminalization over their pregnancy outcomes, including when they used abortion pills to end their pregnancies without supervision from a doctor.\n\nEven if Republicans do win Congress, as president, Harris would still have options to protect and expand abortion access-options that appear on a reproductive freedom wish list supported by hundreds of advocates. Several told me that they are still waiting to see more specific details on abortion access and justice policies Harris would support-and they are hoping those details would go beyond restoring Roe . \"That is not a useful campaign slogan, to say we're going to restore the bare minimum,\" said Renee Bracey Sherman, author of the new book Liberating Abortion .\n\n(A spokesperson for the Harris campaign did not respond to questions from Mother Jones for this story.)\n\nDespite President Joe Biden's reluctance as a devout Catholic to express full-throated support for abortion rights, legal experts say his administration has gotten behind measures that have prevented some of the most extreme Republican efforts to further criminalize abortion. Biden's Department of Justice, for example, issued guidance in December 2022 saying that the Comstock Act-a 19th-century anti-obscenity law-cannot be marshaled to ban the mailing of abortion pills, as Project 2025 and anti-abortion Republicans argue it can .\n\nRachel Rebouché, Dean of Temple University's law school and an expert in reproductive rights laws, notes that if right-wing judges-including those on the Supreme Court-ruled that Comstock should be applied to criminalize the mailing of medication abortion, a Harris-run DOJ could simply refuse to prosecute such cases. This is a place, she says, where Harris potentially \"has the most power.\" Meanwhile, Project 2025 explicitly recommends that the DOJ prosecute those who provide and distribute the pills under a Trump presidency.\n\nHer administration could also continue, and even strengthen, Biden's Department of Health and Human Services attempts to require hospitals-even in states with bans-to provide emergency abortion care when necessary to save the parent's life or protect their health. Legal challenges took that case to the Supreme Court earlier this year, where the justices ultimately punted on interpreting the federal law's applicability to abortion care in emergency situations. Project 2025, on the other hand, claims that \"EMTALA requires no abortions\" and says HHS should stop investigating hospitals that have failed to comply with its interpretation of the law.\n\nUnder Biden, the Food and Drug Administration made the two pills used in medication abortion-mifepristone and misoprostol-easier to access by repealing restrictions that required them to be picked up in person. They now can be ordered online and delivered by mail. (As I have reported , this method now accounts for about 1 in 5 abortions nationwide). Under Harris, the FDA could remove even more restrictions that remain on medication abortion-including limits on who can prescribe them-according to Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C, a resource that provides information on how to access abortion pills. \" All of them need to go,\" Wells told me.\n\nWhile anti-abortion Republicans have baselessly alleged the pills are dangerous, more than 100 scientific studies have confirmed they are overwhelmingly safe and effective- including when they are prescribed virtually and mailed. The FDA, Wells said, should \"update the approval to reflect science and not politics.\" Project 2025 recommends the exact opposite: It says the FDA should immediately re-instate the in-person requirement to access the pills and in the longer term should revoke approval of the drugs entirely. But the FDA and HHS would likely face continued legal challenges if they did try to enact these protections-and the Supreme Court's decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo earlier this year, in which the justices vastly limited the power of federal agencies, could make it harder for those agencies to enact regulations protecting abortion rights, as my colleague Nina Martin has reported .\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge facing abortion access is the repeal of the Hyde Amendment , which prohibits federal funding for abortion with minimal exceptions, leaving millions of low-income people on Medicaid without insurance coverage for abortion. (Paying for an abortion out of pocket can cost upwards of $500, or far more in the second trimester, according to KFF .) This year and since 2016, the Democratic Party platform has called for the repeal of Hyde, and it was one of the campaign promises Harris made the first time she ran for the presidency in 2020. Biden, too, has repeatedly excluded Hyde from his proposed federal budgets over the last few years, but it has always reappeared in the finalized budget passed by Congress. Still, Rebouché says, Harris \"could refuse to sign the budget until Hyde is gone.\" Conversely, Project 2025 calls for strengthening Hyde and codifying it into law.\n\nFlint, from All* Above All, which has campaigned to overturn Hyde, said the policy shows the ways that abortion can be inaccessible even if it's technically legalized, as it was under Roe . \"If we do not figure out how to get government funding,\" she told me, \"we are on the precipice of another crisis, where there's going to be a lot of folks not being able to get abortions, regardless of whether it's legal or not.\"\n\n\"We are on the precipice of another crisis, where there's going to be a lot of folks not being able to get abortions, regardless of whether it's legal.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant ways in which a Harris presidency could alter the reproductive rights landscape is one of the most obvious. \"She could shape a Supreme Court that is not the Dobbs court,\" Rebouché notes. Three of the current justices-including two conservatives, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito-are in their 70s, and could potentially retire during the next president's term. As Rebouché sees it, it's likely that a future liberal-leaning court shaped by Harris could one day undo Dobbs . \"We should continue to talk about Dobbs just the way Alito described Roe : 'Egregiously wrong' and 'erroneously' decided.\" The significance of Harris' ability to pave the way for undoing Dobbs becomes all the more clear when one, again, looks at Project 2025's plans: \"The Dobbs decision,\" it says, \"is just the beginning.\"\n\nThis summer, more than 380 reproductive rights and justice organizations and activists-including Flint's All* Above All- signed onto a 17-page memo called \"Abortion Justice, Now: Protecting Abortion At the Federal Level.\" The brief primarily calls for passing federal legislation that abolishes the so-called viability line established in Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey . \"We know that viability is directly connected to fetal personhood , which is directly connected to the criminalization of pregnancy ,\" Jenni Villavicencio, a practicing OB-GYN and one of the primary authors of the brief, told me. \"We really want to call attention to anybody making policy, including a possible future Harris administration, that it is unacceptable to enshrine any sort of limit\" for abortion access.\n\nTwo pieces of legislation-both introduced last year-are highlighted as model policies that could help expand access. The first is the Abortion Justice Act , sponsored by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), which would establish a federal right to abortion without limits, provide $350 million in annual grant funding to support abortion access, and increase the number of abortion-providing facilities. The EACH Act , introduced by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) would effectively repeal Hyde. Spokespeople for both politicians said that they, or their colleagues, plan to re-introduce some version of the legislation in the next session of Congress.\n\nMajor medical groups also support abolishing gestational limits from abortion policy, and in August, more than 400 physicians also signed onto a letter , spearheaded by the group Physicians for Reproductive Rights, asking Biden and Harris to support \"moving beyond the legal framework created by Roe ,\" in part by supporting abortion access later in pregnancy. But the issue of gestational limits has long divided the reproductive rights movement, which has struggled to balance where to compromise in its quest for broad abortion rights, as my colleague Madison Pauly has reported . Notably absent from the signatories of the memo, for example, are some of the largest abortion rights groups, including Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom For All. (Spokespeople for those groups did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nFor Democrats, this has long been a tough needle to thread. The anti-abortion right has argued that Democrats support abortions later in pregnancy or, as Trump has insisted without basis, \"even after birth.\" But more than 90 percent of abortions nationwide take place within the first trimester, according to CDC data , and many Democrats, including Harris, have said they support the viability limit that existed under Roe , with later-term exceptions for emergency complications. Harris reiterated that at her debate with Trump, when he repeated his lies about Democrats supporting infanticide.\n\nAs Bracey Sherman, author of Liberating Abortion , points out, many of the tragic cases the Harris campaign has highlighted-in which people with wanted pregnancies had miscarriages , nonviable pregnancies , or other health emergencies requiring abortion-may not have had different outcomes under Roe . \"There is no evidence that those people would be helped because they would still be stuck with the same viability line and the exception line,\" she said. \"We need to be pushing for abortion access at any time, for any reason, for anyone, anywhere in this country.\"\n\nVillavicencio, for her part, says she recognizes the necessity of compromise in policymaking. \"What we patently reject,\" she adds, \"is compromise when it is for people who are the most marginalized\"-specifically the young, low-income people, and people of color, many of whom struggled to access abortion care under Roe. Under Harris, she and other advocates see a possibility for a fresh start. As Flint, of All* Above All, says, \"We have an incredible opportunity in the ashes of Roe v. Wade to build the thing that our community needs.\"\n\nBut that all depends on who wins on Tuesday.\n\nUpdate, Nov. 1: This story has been updated to clarify the Biden administration's interpretation that EMTALA requires hospitals to provide abortion care to protect patients' health-not just their lives.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Overturning Roe v. Wade Led to More Abortions Overall, According to New Research\n\nRichard Vogel/AP\n\nAbortion-rights opponents have long said their goal is to end abortion nationwide. So when they succeeded in overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022, it seemed to be the closest they'd ever come.\n\nYet new data is making it increasingly clear that in the 12 months after the court ended the national right to abortion, licensed clinicians provided slightly more abortions nationwide, not fewer. According to numbers released Tuesday by the Society of Family Planning , a professional association for healthcare providers who specialize in abortion and contraception, even as 14 states enacted near-total bans on abortion, the number of abortions performed in states bordering the new abortion deserts surged, making up the difference. In particular, California, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and New Mexico saw their monthly abortion numbers skyrocket.\n\nThe report, the fourth installment in the Society of Family Planning's #WeCount project , tallies a year's worth of medication and other abortions reported by licensed providers working in brick-and-mortar abortion clinics, private medical offices, telehealth clinics, and hospitals. The researchers did not attempt to count self-managed abortions. Their findings are in line with research released last month by the Guttmacher Institute, which used a statistical model, historical data, and surveys to estimate that 46,000 more abortions took place in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2020. \"We're using two different methodologies and finding more or less the same patterns,\" says Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at Guttmacher.\n\nThe new data underscores the argument from abortion-rights advocates that abortion bans don't stop abortions. But the overall slight rise in abortion numbers nationwide \"is not evidence that the bans are not working,\" warns Ushma Upadhyay, #WeCount co-chair and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. \"What actually happened during these 12 months is that abortion access plummeted to zero in some states, while increasing to meet the acute need in others.\"\n\nMeeting that need has required a monumental effort across the abortion care infrastructure. Providers relocated or opened new clinics while advocates switched into overdrive, operating networks of organizations that provide funding , support , and information to scared and confused patients. Since Dobbs , at least 114 facilities have raised limits on how late in pregnancy they will perform abortions, expanding options for patients seeking an abortion after the first trimester, according to recent UCSF research. State and municipal governments set aside nearly $208 million to pay for abortion, contraception, and support service-including a $20 million budget line item in California paying for out-of-state patients to travel there for abortions. Donations to abortion funds soared, too-at least temporarily . Meanwhile, virtual clinics that provide abortion pills by mail have grown steadily since 2020 , when a federal court (later followed by the FDA) halted an old rule requiring patients to pick up the medication from a clinic in person. Since Dobbs, the average monthly number of abortions provided by virtual-only clinics increased by 72 percent, according to the data released Tuesday.\n\nAll of these changes add up to expanded access in states that protect abortion-benefitting both in- and out-of-state patients. Yet this new normal is fragile. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to take up a case that could eliminate access to the common abortion medication mifepristone. The state supreme court in Florida, another surge state, is currently considering whether to affirm a 15-week ban on abortion; if it does, a 6-week ban will take effect shortly afterward. Amber Gavin, vice president of advocacy and operations at A Woman's Choice, an independent clinic with locations in North Carolina and Florida, is awaiting that decision nervously. \"I'm truly not sure where the thousands of people across the Southeast who need abortion care after six weeks will turn to, as many of our abortion clinics are at capacity and it could take weeks for folks to get an appointment,\" Gavin says.\n\nAs always, the curse is time: Every week it takes make a decision, find an appointment, and pull together the money-then arrange time off work, childcare, and travel-pushes a patient further into pregnancy. Take too long, and you could pass gestational limits in surrounding states, or require a more expensive and time-consuming procedure. Megan Jeyifo, the executive director of the Chicago Abortion Fund, says she hears stories about \"the difficulty of parsing through disinformation and fake abortion clinics, confusion regarding legality, worry about costs and travel barriers, lack of available appointments in surge states, and delays due to securing time off from work or childcare.\" Before Dobbs , the average caller to the Chicago Abortion Fund's hotline was 9.9 weeks into pregnancy; after, that figure rose to 15.6 weeks.\n\nCould Dobbs not only have led to overall increases in abortion, but also caused more people to get abortions later in pregnancy? \"It's exactly the question that everyone is asking,\" Upadhyay says. \"It's important to know all of the effects of these bans.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Reversing Roe v. Wade Is All About Minority Rule\n\nGrace Molteni/Mother Jones; Andrew Rice/Unsplash\n\nMonika Bauerlein May 9, 2022\n\nThis is about minority rule. And it always has been.\n\nThat's what I found myself thinking as I watched my feeds fill with the breaking news of the Supreme Court leaked draft decision to overrule Roe v. Wade last week (and I'd love to hear how you're processing the news-share your thoughts here ).\n\nI thought about the pregnancies that my loved ones, my friends, and I have ended, and about what it would have been like to be forced by the state to carry them to term. I thought about a future of state-enforced pregnancies for my children. I thought about the lives lost trying to end pregnancies with no legal protection. I reread the searing 2004 essay in which Mother Jones contributor Eleanor Cooney recalled her terrifying pre- Roe journey to doctor after doctor, each of whom told her she was \"too far gone\" for an illegal abortion. The article contains a photo of a woman who died in 1964, after her boyfriend tried to perform an abortion in a hotel room. It is grim. And necessary.\n\nBut most of all, I thought about how far gone a democracy is when 54 percent of the population support a constitutional right and 28 percent oppose it, yet the 28 percent position wins out.\n\nMy colleague Ari Berman wrote about this in 2019, after Georgia passed one of the first in the new crop of anti-abortion bills even though only 44 percent of Georgians favored it. As Ari explained, \"Republicans invest so much energy into voter suppression...because it allows them to enact cruel, unpopular policies with no accountability at the ballot box. The GOP doesn't need to have the support of a majority of the state's voters if it skews who actually gets to vote.\"\n\nSame in Washington, DC. Five of the Supreme Court's nine justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. In the Senate, the 50 Republican senators represent 41 million fewer people than the 50 Democrats. The GOP controls state legislatures and congressional delegations through an absurd degree of gerrymandering: In Wisconsin, 75 percent of districts are heavily Republican, even though Joe Biden won the state in 2020. In Texas , just under 40 percent of the population is white, but white voters are the majority in 60 percent of state legislative seats. (It took me a minute to wrap my head around that math.) The Texas legislature that passed a \"heartbeat\" bill, which forces women to leave the state for abortion care, is 73 percent male and 61 percent white . It's hard not to think of apartheid-era South Africa when you look at numbers like that.\n\nTough words? Maybe-but these are tough facts, and sugarcoating them doesn't serve anyone. In fact, there's an argument that sugarcoating the abortion debate is part of what got us here. As the journalist Farai Chideya, who hosts the podcast Our Body Politic , wrote on Twitter , \"Too many times I've been in newsrooms where a post- Roe and post-Voting Rights Act future was dismissed summarily as a possibility. So we as a profession created a dangerous filter bubble, dismissing individuals and groups as fringe when they were the tip of the spear.\"\n\nI don't need to tell you that at MoJo , these possibilities were not dismissed: They were investigated. Seven years ago, Molly Redden documented how, in many places, \" the war on women is over, and women lost .\" Three years ago, Becca Andrews showed how women in Mississippi were already living in a post- Roe world, and Nina Liss-Schultz outlined how abortion rights defenders were preparing for worse yet to come. Stephanie Mencimer laid out what Sam Alito is all about back in 2016. (\"If you want to know his judicial philosophy,\" one legal expert summarized, \"just look at the Republican Party platform.\") Just a few weeks ago Arianna Coghill chronicled how states were tripping over each other to pass anti-abortion laws, and Lil Kalish showed how technology may help states that want to force people to stay pregnant.\n\nThese journalists in our newsroom, and many others, were not chronicling the battle over abortion as a he-said-she-said political fight. They were illuminating the visceral stakes for people's lives. All of our lives. Something else I've been thinking about is how different my life has been from my great-grandmother's Therese's. She gave birth 17 times and had to bury six of her children. I'm grateful that my grandfather was one of the survivors. But what if Therese had been able to choose motherhood rather than endure it? We're not far removed from these times.\n\nThe story of abortion is about whether people get to make profoundly personal decisions themselves. It's about whether parents are allowed to love and support their children ; whether people can get life-saving medical care without fear of imprisonment; whether sexual harassment and sexual assault are condoned or confronted ; whether women should be more harshly punished for confronting an abuser than the abusers themselves. All of these issues are connected, and all are connected with the fundamental question of whether our democracy works for all, or is hijacked to serve a minority's last-chance grasp for power.\n\nAnd that story is at the heart of what Mother Jones does. \"Two days out from the news and I'm still reeling,\" my colleague Inae Oh, MoJo 's senior news and engagement editor, wrote in our newsletter. \"But the initial shock has also given way to a kind of mobilization in the newsroom that, at least for me, echoes the emergency of election night in 2016, when it became clear that the unthinkable had actually happened.\"\n\n\"I'll never forget the all-hands-on-deck feeling,\" Inae writes. \"Despite the anger and despair, everyone wanted to pitch in, plan the fight. Something similar is happening now as abortion rights hang in the balance. The pages of Mother Jones are making sure to call it like it is.\"\n\nAnd calling it like it is can make a big difference. This week I found myself thinking way back to 2010, when Republicans took over Congress in a backlash to the first Black president. Many in the media were covering the tea party as if it were a brand new phenomenon, but it wasn't hard to see that its agenda was very familiar. Within weeks the new majority was trying to redefine rape so as to deny abortions to women who needed federal funds. MoJo 's reporting on this change, buried deep in an amendment, spurred a backlash and \"Dear John\" letter-writing campaign to then-House Speaker John Boehner, and the legislation died .\n\nThat was when Republicans still thought of themselves as a potential majority party that needed to be careful about offending the majority of the country. Today's GOP has fewer qualms, because it has bet on minority rule, and Trump has shown them that when you're appealing to a minority of the population, cruelty can be a winner. Alito's draft Supreme Court opinion recognizes no exception for the pregnant person's life or health, or for rape or incest-even though overwhelming majorities, including four in five Republicans , support those exceptions. It takes aim at same-sex marriage, which a majority of Republicans support . And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott chose this moment to talk about challenging a Court decision affirming public education for all.\n\nThat's the bigger picture of what happened this week, and that's what MoJo has been covering-to the point where now, others are starting to recognize the patterns too. This week I saw the term \"minority rule\" in a lot of other media as they covered the decision. It took long enough.\n\nSo as we start the first full week of this new reality, I'm also reminding myself that by no means all is lost. So many people-including so many of you-are gearing up to protect your rights and those of others. Some are donating to abortion funds and signing up as clinic volunteers, some are clearing their calendars for canvassing, or running, in the elections this fall. Some are thinking of new ways to ensure access to reproductive care . Some are committing themselves to the long, hard, yet hopeful work of organizing the majority of Americans who want a democratic government that respects their private choices.\n\nAs we see over and over around the world, minority rule is both oppressive and, ultimately, fragile. Over the long haul, it is always on the defensive against the collective power of a determined majority.\n\nAnd it's always on the defensive against the power of facts . It's telling that shortly after the decision was leaked, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pleaded with conservatives to position themselves as \"compassionate consensus builders\" and emphasizing that \"Republicans DO NOT want to take away contraception\" and \"DO NOT want to throw doctors and women in jail.\" In fact, Republicans cheerfully kept saying that they wanted to do exactly that.\n\nExposing lies and undermining talking points is what Mother Jones exists to do, and it showed last week. In just one day while I was writing this, here's what my colleagues published: A story from Kiera Butler, who is based in Georgia, about how social media has become a breeding ground for anti-birth control disinformation covertly promoted by anti-abortion groups. A powerful dispatch from Florida, where Laura C. Morel investigated the increasingly aggressive tactics that protesters are using to harass. An analysis by Jackie Mogensen, who read through the entirety of Justice Alito's 98-page opinion and tallied all of its footnotes to see how often Alito cited scholarship and judicial opinions from men vs women. (Do yourself a favor and watch her share the results in just one fact-packed minute!)\n\nWhen the Supreme Court news hit last week, Mother Jones was in the middle of a spring fundraising drive that is critical to keeping these reporters and others on the beat.

      "text": "Overturning Roe Didn't Just Cut Off Access. It Sabotaged Science, Too.\n\nÁlvaro Bernis\n\nIn early May 2022, reproductive health researcher Liz Mosley was at a dinner celebrating her first day as an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine when the news broke: A leaked draft of the Dobbs decision revealed the Supreme Court's plan to gut abortion rights in the United States-the \"worst-case scenario,\" as one dinner guest put it.\n\nMosley also worried the ruling would upend her work as a scientist. She and her colleagues were in the process of conducting a study of Americans' attitudes toward pregnancy, which included interviews and a survey asking 550 pregnant people ages 15 to 49 from around the country about options they'd considered. Some reproductive health clinics in Texas, from which she'd hoped to recruit-and where SB 8 , an especially restrictive state law, was already making providers jittery-were spooked. \"We lost Texas as a research site,\" she told me. \"The clinics just said the risk to their patients, legally, is too high.\"\n\nThe decimation of reproductive health care has been predictably brutal in the two years since the Dobbs ruling. Abortion is now banned (or nearly so) in at least 17 states , dozens of providers have stopped offering abortions, and an untold number of clinicians have fled red states. You can add to that yet another post- Roe ripple: the challenges public health researchers like Mosley now face. Studies related to abortion have been delayed, limited, and blocked at a time when understanding the landscape couldn't be more critical.\n\n\"The clinics just said the risk to their patients, legally, is too high.\"\n\nSome of the research holdups are the result of legitimate concern for participants. In Pennsylvania, where abortion is legal but restricted, Pitt's Institutional Review Board (IRB), an ethics committee overseeing research at the university, asked Mosley to alter her study design, citing data privacy fears and the prospect of meddling by law enforcement. She agreed to some big changes, which mostly included eliminating minors from the interviews. \"You can imagine that was a real loss,\" she says. Research suggests that financial and logistical obstacles may cause teens to discover their pregnancies later than adults and encounter more challenges accessing care. Now, Mosley says, it's harder for her team to identify how to best support pregnant minors, and to determine the \"long-term health and social impacts\" of their life path, whether it involves abortion, adoption, or parenting.\n\nIn 2023, Mosley conducted another survey, this time of her peers: In a questionnaire, some two dozen reproductive health researchers shared their experiences with their own institutional review boards. Most reported some kind of challenge, like confusion over state laws, increased scrutiny of abortion-related work, and at least one researcher's total inability to get studies greenlit. Even projects not obviously associated with abortion, Mosley says, were affected by Dobbs . Some universities, for instance, are now requiring \"full board review\" for any study involving pregnancy.\n\nWhat's more, previously available stats-the number of abortions per Georgia county, for example­­-have been stripped from government websites, and accurate granular data is \"much harder to get our hands on,\" Mosley says. (A spokesperson from the Georgia Department of Public Health confirms that local abortion data was removed last year after \"a legal review,\" but said state-level data is still public.)\n\nSociologist Tracy Weitz, who studies reproductive health at American University in Washington, DC, tells me that some of the best data for understanding health inequities, such as patients' race, ethnicity, and zip code, was once provided by states hostile to abortion, where anti-choice lawmakers instituted data collection as a regulatory hoop for abortion providers to jump through. But with abortion now banned in those places, much of the data is gone.\n\nEven in blue states, providers are more hesitant to share certain demographic data, or even collect it-Illinois and Maine, for example, have stopped gathering some information . \"That data becomes important when we're trying to figure out who in the post- Dobbs environment is getting abortions and who isn't,\" Weitz says. (It's also critical to helping policymakers understand the consequences of their actions.)\n\nOne solution is anonymous surveys, but those present their own challenges. During a 2023 workshop held by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine , University of Wisconsin reproductive health researcher Jenny Higgins reported that fake individuals, or \"bots,\" had submitted about 3,000 responses to one of her surveys one weekend. Her team then had to spend hours on data quality checks and hire a data scientist to \"weed out\" ineligible participants.\n\nResearchers also say it's gotten harder to secure a \"certificate of confidentiality\" from the National Institutes of Health-a designation that can prevent sensitive information collected as part of a study from being subpoenaed. The agency has started asking researchers whether they have ­privacy agreements with third-party companies like Zoom and Microsoft stating that the companies will not share participant data. But tech companies have little incentive to make that promise. (The NIH insists there have been \"no changes\" to its certification policy since it took effect in 2017.)\n\nOne silver lining: Dobbs has brought about an \"all hands on deck\" moment and more interest in the field.\n\nThe work environment \"hasn't all been bad,\" says Diana Greene Foster, a demographer and professor at the University of California, San Francisco, whose institutional review board has actually expedited abortion-related research. Dobbs , in her experience, has brought about an \"all hands on deck\" moment and more interest in the field. In anticipation of the ruling, Foster launched an effort to study the last people to terminate their pregnancies in states where bans were to take effect, comparing their experiences to those who sought abortions afterward. The initial results, she says, appear to show that the number of people who failed to obtain an abortion is \"much lower\" than she expected, perhaps because they were able to obtain abortion pills online.\n\nBut the overall sentiment I heard from researchers is that they want more support from the federal government. Mosley says universities need \"unifying\" guidance that directs institutional review boards to fast-track abortion studies and helps researchers assess the legal and social risks for participants from different states. Especially needed, Weitz says, is protection from subpoenas. There are no federal laws that automatically protect the privacy of abortion seekers whom researchers question remotely by phone, email, or video chat.\n\nMore fundamentally, the researchers want the government to normalize the study of abortion, which is historically underfunded due to stigma. This year, the White House called on Congress to fund a $12 billion initiative to support \"women's health research\"-but it's unclear which studies will be eligible. In the meantime, Weitz says, the work has been left largely to privately funded academics and journalists. Abortion is health care, and the government has \"an obligation,\" she insists, \"to study it the way they study any other major public health issue in the United States.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Restore Roe, or Go Beyond It? The Question Is Fracturing the Abortion Rights Movement.\n\nMadison Pauly September 11, 2023\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nUpdate, January 19, 2024: After months of court battles and internal turmoil , a coalition of abortion-rights advocates in Missouri announced on Thursday that it will begin collecting signatures for a 2024 ballot measure that includes a fetal viability line-protecting abortion access before viability, but not after. Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri has joined the coalition, known as Missourians for Constitutional Freedom , and is formally backing the ballot initiative effort despite its earlier opposition to enshrining the viability standard in the state constitution.\n\nNot long after Election Day last November, Pamela Merritt joined a call with other abortion-rights activists in Missouri to discuss a daring proposal: sidestepping the state's ruling Republicans by directly asking voters whether to add abortion rights to their state constitution. The group hoped to capitalize on a recent trend. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June of 2022, pro-choice voters had been showing up to the polls in force , rejecting anti-abortion ballot initiatives in Kansas , Kentucky, and Montana. They went even further in California, Michigan, and Vermont, passing state constitutional amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to choose abortion.\n\nThis unbroken string of victories has energized advocates who see ballot initiatives as a key tool in the post- Roe world, especially in states controlled by Republicans. Even in Missouri, where the anti-abortion movement was so successful that only one clinic remained by 2022, national progressive organizations smell opportunity. \"Right now, every single state is dealing with a pro-abortion, riled-up base that wants a Kansas,\" Merritt says, referring to the special election about abortion last year that drew greater turnout than any primary in the state's history. \"There's pressure.\"\n\nMerritt, who runs the advocacy group Medical Students for Choice, is a veteran of the reproductive justice movement. She has seen how, since Roe , the anti-abortion crusade forced advocates to compromise on their principles again and again. How the flawed laws that resulted often required providers to follow rules not based in science or medicine, and made abortion a right in name only in large swaths of the country. And how the limitations fell hardest on those with the least means or ability to travel to get care. With the slate wiped clean without Roe , Merritt and like-minded activists see an opportunity to build a more comprehensive, and holistic, future of abortion access.\n\nBut not everyone at the Missouri ballot table was on the same page about how to move forward. In the months following the 2022 election, the group-a mix of advocates including the state ACLU and Planned Parenthood affiliates and the local activist group Abortion Action Missouri-splintered. Some members, including Merritt, wanted to go with language that would enshrine a broad right to abortion. Others wanted to consider an amendment with baked-in compromises in the hopes of winning over more voters. They proposed letting the state impose or preserve restrictions that the larger abortion-rights movement often condemns, including a ban on procedures after so-called fetal viability-the hard-to-pin-down point in pregnancy at which a fetus has a decent chance of surviving outside the uterus. (Viability limits often include an exception for abortions needed to protect a pregnant patient's life or health.)\n\nThe disagreement became so heated that Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, operator of the last clinic standing in the state in 2022, paused its work on the ballot effort this spring, and has spent months warning its coalition partners about the harms of the proposed restrictions. \"We, as a movement, have an opportunity right now to live our values,\" says Colleen McNicholas, the affiliate's chief medical officer. Versions of the ballot initiative currently on the table would \"recreate the very system that led to fewer than 100 Missourians being able to access abortion\" in-state each year, she says.\n\nMallory Schwarz, the executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, disagrees. \"These policies would restore a level of access that the state hasn't seen, ever,\" she says. \"It's frustrating to see partners try to hold Missourians hostage while waiting for the moment for that perfect policy.\"\n\nThis fracturing has cast doubt on whether a version of the initiative will even make it to the ballot next year. The effort is already facing vigorous opposition from GOP state officials who have falsely described the proposals as costing billions and allowing for \"dangerous, unregulated, unrestricted\" abortion access. At present, it's unclear whether a campaign for an abortion-rights constitutional amendment would receive the support of the state's sole former abortion provider-or from the national Planned Parenthood Action Fund, whose national campaigns director, Sarah Standiford, says it will \"follow the lead of state affiliates.\"\n\nUnwilling to support a ballot measure that comes with restrictions on abortion access, Merritt and Medical Students for Choice stepped back from the coalition in July. \"The abortion rights and health movement has been in a death spiral of compromise for about 30 years,\" Merritt says. \"We have an opportunity here to build something better, and we're not even talking about it.\"\n\nThis battle over what the abortion-rights movement should fight for is playing out across the country, as activists in Ohio , Arizona , Florida , Nebraska , and South Dakota are working on ballot initiatives, mostly for the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo Erika Christensen and Garin Marschall, the story in Missouri-and particularly the fight over fetal viability limits-follows familiar patterns. The wife-and-husband team became activists after Christensen had to travel for her own abortion later in pregnancy. In 2016, doctors told her that the baby boy she'd been carrying for 31 weeks wouldn't be able to breathe outside her body. But Roe only protected the right to abortion until viability, and at that time her home state of New York had a criminal ban on terminating pregnancies after 24 weeks unless a mother's life was in danger. Christensen flew to Colorado, a state without a viability limit, to get a shot that would stop the baby's heart. Then, because she had preexisting health conditions, she flew home to deliver him with her doctors.\n\nThe legal concept of a \"viability\" line has never matched medical reality. The idea was conceived of by a clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun who sought a middle ground between abortion supporters and opponents when the Supreme Court was considering Roe v. Wade in the 70s. Today, it is generally thought of as occurring about 24 weeks into pregnancy. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a leading medical association, describes viability as a complex calculation involving gestational age, sex, genetics, weight, and the circumstances of delivery, such as whether intensive neonatal care is available. \"It's talked about as this very simple line in the sand, and that couldn't be further from the truth,\" says Jenni Villavicencio, one of a handful of doctors in the country who provides abortions in all trimesters. For that reason, ACOG says it strongly opposes policymakers \"using viability as a basis to limit access to evidence-based care.\"\n\nAs of 2020, fewer than 1 percent of abortions took place after 20 weeks' gestation. Patients are generally experiencing harrowing circumstances: In addition to women like Christensen, who receive catastrophic news about a pregnancy, they tend to be very young, in an abusive relationship, or facing other tremendous barriers to getting care. \"I totally understand why folks may have complex emotions or even react negatively to the idea of abortion later in pregnancy,\" Villavicencio says. \"What I would hope is that folks will recognize that these are really unique situations in which people are making decisions that make sense for them in their own lives, and they're doing so extraordinarily thoughtfully.\"\n\nNot long after Christensen flew to Colorado to end her pregnancy, she and Marschall joined a campaign to remove New York's criminal penalties for later abortion. Yet the law they helped pass, the Reproductive Health Act of 2019 , ultimately maintained a viability line in the form of civil sanctions for doctors who performed abortion after 24 weeks, with exceptions to preserve the mother's health, and in cases of fatal fetal diagnoses. The pair say that state senate Democrats shot down their pleas to consider a more expansive version.\n\nDisappointed with the limitations of the new law, they launched a philanthropy-funded project called Patient Forward to keep advocating against viability bans nationally. They soon realized they had their work cut out for them. Over the last half a year, Marschall and Christensen have watched with dismay as coalitions in Ohio , Florida , and Missouri proposed measures that would protect abortion but allow viability bans. As they researched the initiatives, they began hearing from colleagues on the ground that the language was based on confidential polling. \"What they were telling us is that we have to compromise, because if we go for broad protections with no viability limit, it'll never pass,\" Christensen says. The conclusion is in line with the popular sentiment that later abortion is unpalatable-an idea reinforced by right-wing politicians when they decry \"abortion up until the moment of birth\" in response to any pro-choice proposal, falsely implying that later abortions are common, casual decisions.\n\nWithout access to the polling data their colleagues were citing, Patient Forward decided to commission a survey of its own this summer, asking the public opinion research firm PerryUndem to measure whether voters were more likely to support an abortion-rights amendment if it permitted viability restrictions.\n\nTo the couple's surprise, they were not. The findings that came back showed that nationally, voters were 15 points more likely to \"definitely vote yes\" on an expansive abortion-rights ballot initiative, compared with one that allowed a viability limit. When asked why, most respondents said they did not want government controlling any decisions about abortion. \"I literally cried when I read the results,\" Christensen says. \"I felt really encouraged. I was like, Oh, my God, here's pages and pages of people who aren't immediately talking about how I'm a monster.\"\n\nShe and Marschall shared the results of their poll with other advocates. They hoped it might hold sway with a coalition of advocates in Arizona who were thinking through a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights, even though they were aware that the coalition would base its decisions on its own, state-specific data.\n\nBut in early August, when the state coalition, Arizona for Abortion Access­ , filed a proposed amendment with the Secretary of State's office, they included language to restrict access to abortions after the point of fetal viability, except for when needed to protect the health or life of the pregnant person. \"Based upon the data that we received from our polling, the language with viability was the strongest option,\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona senior advisor Chris Love told a Washington Post reporter. \"That's the option that we think most Arizona voters will go with.\"\n\nThe day after the announcement of the Arizona campaign, Indivisible published a memo gushing about how its own data indicated that the coalition's measure would motivate pro-choice voters and dampen Republican turnout­­-\"boosting Democratic candidates up and down the ticket in a state with numerous, must-win competitive races at the Presidential, Senate, House, and state legislative level.\"\n\nIn a statement, the coalition says it \"listened to Arizonans and designed a measure that provides meaningful protections for abortion that can win at the ballot box next November.\" Disappointed by the language, Christensen and Marschall are resigned to keep working to lift viability limits in the long term, if not the short. \"It's so hard, because it's too late,\" Christensen says of the proposal in her state. \"There's nothing I can do to change it.\"\n\nIn Missouri, the quest to enshrine more expansive abortion rights in the constitution faces a tough road ahead. A survey conducted by St. Louis University and YouGov in August 2022 found that just 48 percent of voters would support an amendment to overturn the state's ban on abortions; 13 percent were unsure. A majority thought it should be legal to get an abortion in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. But support fell drastically for legal abortion later in pregnancy.\n\nWhen the Missouri coalition sat down to craft its own polling late last year, the discussion over what to ask voters grew tense. Merritt, the Medical Students for Choice director, saw it as a red flag that other organizers wanted to quiz voters on whether they'd support versions of an amendment with restrictions. In her mind, the group shouldn't even consider language that contradicts doctors' understanding of pregnancy and leaves out vulnerable community members. \"I don't care if the polling shows that parental notification and viability show the ballot winning with 90 percent of the vote,\" she says. \"I'm asking medical schools to maintain abortion and family planning curriculum that is medically accurate, evidence based, patient centered-and we've got abortion-rights groups advancing viability ?\"\n\nThe coalition's internal polling has not been made public. Yet drafts of the group's proposed legislation, filed with the Missouri Secretary of State in March, hint at what it might have said. All 11 versions establish a right to \"reproductive freedom\"-the ability to make and carry out one's own decisions about abortion, contraception, and healthcare throughout pregnancy. They also would set a very high legal bar for how the government can regulate abortion. But 10 of the 11 versions contain exceptions to that high bar. They would let the state require parental consent for minors seeking abortions (while allowing doctors to grant exceptions in certain cases); ban abortion after 24 weeks or viability (unless a patient's health is endangered); and maintain an existing law forbidding Medicaid funding for abortion care.\n\nThe coalition is still deciding whether to proceed with the amendment campaign at all, much less which version to run. Their decisions are complicated by legal fights with state GOP officials over how the various proposed amendments would be described in the voting booth.\n\nSchwarz, the leader of Abortion Action Missouri, says the decision about whether to proceed will depend on how those amendment descriptions perform in future public opinion polls. The Missouri electorate, she says, has been subject to \"years of political indoctrination and racist and classist messaging\" affecting their opinions on abortion rights. She sees a campaign for a constitutional amendment as a chance to educate more voters and permanently shift their thinking. Yet without strong polling now, among the current electorate, the campaign will struggle to secure the funding it needs to collect signatures and ultimately win the election. Tony Rothert, director of integrated advocacy for the ACLU of Missouri, puts it plainly: \"There isn't going to be $30 million for a campaign that does not have a chance of winning.\"\n\nThroughout this process, the Missouri coalition has been receiving advice and support from the Fairness Project , the national group behind a wave of successful ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid and raise the minimum wage. Recently, the group has begun throwing its weight behind abortion-rights measures, such as the successful Michigan amendment last year, which also allowed for a viability limit. \"We're in a moment where abortion-rights advocates nationally and in every state are trying to figure out how we deepen our understanding of where the electorate is,\" says Fairness Project executive director Kelly Hall. Getting answers, she adds, requires \"a deeper dive than just 'Do you support abortion rights? Do you oppose extreme bans?' Because there are a lot of nuances to both how policies can be crafted, and opposition messages.\"\n\nThe inclusion of a viability line in proposed amendments is putting advocates beyond Missouri in a difficult position as well. Take an abortion-rights measure in Ohio, which voters will decide on in November, and which allows for a viability ban. ACOG, the national medical organization, says the amendment \"is not completely in line\" with its \"policy of support for access to abortion without restrictions.\" Yet members of the association's Ohio chapter requested permission to endorse the initiative anyway, and the ACOG board of directors voted to allow it. In a statement, the association says the directors made their decision \"to provide relief\" for physicians and patients for whom the amendment would restore access.\n\nOther national abortion-rights groups say they are following the lead of state-level advocates when it comes to which measures to support. \"It is not always possible to achieve our entire vision in one step, but we strive to enact policies that will do the most good for the most people along the way,\" says ACLU senior campaign strategist Carolyn Ehrlich. Standiford, of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, says she knows that viability limits are \"arbitrary.\" Yet she considers ballot initiatives that include them \"supportable\" in places where viability is already enshrined in state law.\n\nAs the compromises continue, some abortion-rights advocates are fed up. \"'It's 'Big Repro' who has spent the last 50 years saying, ' Roe was the floor, Roe was not enough,'\" says one abortion provider, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing connections in the movement. \"Now that they have an opportunity to go beyond Roe , they're not. No one in 'Big Repro'-Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights, the ACLU, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the National Abortion Federation-none of them are coming out and saying, 'This is bullshit. Why are we enshrining this?'\"\n\nMerritt stepped back from the Missouri coalition after a period of intense reflection. She says she \"dusted out Loretta Ross' ' Reproductive Justice 101 '\" and thought about what it meant to keep sitting at the ballot table as a Black woman widely respected in the movement. Ultimately, she decided: If the only proposal that could win was one that contained restrictions like parental consent and a viability line, it meant the time to try to pass an amendment wasn't right. Not when the concessions would be written into the state constitution. \"The answer to not having a win for bodily autonomy is not restrictions,\" she concluded. \"It has to be a reassessment of the timing of the ballot.\"\n\nMcNicholas, at Planned Parenthood of St. Louis, isn't ruling out supporting the amendment campaign going forward. Yet as she weighs the issues, she says she thinks often of the personal stories of vulnerable and marginalized patients she's used to advocate against restrictions in the past. \"I oftentimes think of how easy it is to share those stories of pain and devastation when we're on the defense,\" she says. \"We cannot be a movement that has spent decades sharing those tragic impacts, only to turn around and compromise on those folks quickly, when we have an opportunity to do something bold and proactive.\"\n\nRobin Utz is one of the women whose story was deployed by advocates campaigning for abortion rights. After four years of trying to conceive, Utz finally became pregnant in Missouri in 2016, only to learn at 20 weeks and 6 days that her daughter had a fatal kidney disease that would prevent her lungs from developing. Knowing her daughter had no chance of survival, Utz got an abortion six days later, on the second-to-last possible day before Missouri's viability cutoff. Afterwards, she shared her story online and introduced herself to local abortion-rights organizations. She spoke at their fundraisers; lobbied for bills they supported; and served as treasurer on a failed 2019 campaign to block the trigger ban state officials would ultimately enact within minutes of the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\nIt's possible that women like Utz, who know for sure their child won't survive birth, would still be able to access an abortion under the type of limit being considered by the Missouri ballot coalition. It all comes down to doctors, who would be legally tasked with determining if a pregnancy was viable-and deciding how much of a risk to take for patients whose cases may not be so clear-cut. Over and over in the last year, pregnant people who qualify for exceptions under state bans have been unable to find doctors willing to provide them an abortion. As a result, patients as young as 13 have had no choice but to carry their pregnancies to term.\n\nUtz is conflicted over whether she would vote for one of the compromise amendments currently on the table in Missouri. On one hand, she doesn't want any abortion-rights initiative to fail. But she says she's lost faith in the local groups that helped her become an activist, taught her about reproductive justice, and provided a sense of community after her own later abortion. \"A lot of people that helped me see how loud we could be, how grand of a vision we could have, are now the same people pushing forward these terrible, incomplete things,\" she says. \"Some of those organizations are the ones pushing forward ballot initiative language now that cuts me out.\"\n\nTop image: Mother Jones illustration; Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty (3); Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "With Roe Gone, Where Do We Go From Here?\n\nJessica Mason Pieklo July 12, 2022\n\nEven though I knew this moment was coming, I'm disoriented by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and upending abortion access across the country.\n\nThe map of abortion access changes almost daily, as statewide \"trigger\" laws take effect, are blocked by state courts, and then take effect again. Nightmare stories have emerged of a 10-year-old abuse victim forced to travel out-of-state for an abortion, while arthritis and lupus patients are suddenly without the life-saving medication methotrexate in states with abortion bans. Methotrexate is used to treat various autoimmune conditions and cancers, but because that drug is also an \"abortifacient\" used to treat medically doomed ectopic pregnancies, pharmacies have now become reluctant to fill those prescriptions. In places like Ohio , advocates worry about being able to train and retain doctors in this post- Roe landscape.\n\nThat's just within the first weeks since the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization .\n\nWhile the immediate fallout from the decision is disorienting, the response from national Democratic leadership has been downright disappointing. Despite having a month between the draft opinion leak and the formal opinion release, national Democrats have done bupkis . Their response to this escalating human rights crisis? Urging their constituents to just vote harder. The Biden administration has met advocates' cries for court reform measures and pleas to release executive orders declaring a public health emergency first with an insistence that political and institutional norms -rather than actual human lives-are what needs to be saved. Only when the political pressure became too unrelenting did Biden issue an Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services , though it offers more hope than it does action.\n\nIt is a good thing the Biden administration has vowed to protect the digital privacy of abortion patients, promised to expand access to medication abortion, and to facilitate and protect patients traveling out of state for care. The task force of volunteer attorneys and government agencies are promising steps, but without details from the administration for how these protections are to be enforced, as well as specific calls for agency rule-making and a call for the Food and Drug Administration to permanently end restrictions around medication, it feels like too little at a time when what is needed is big and bold action.\n\nIt's political malpractice of the gravest degree, and it will absolutely cost lives.\n\nThankfully, abortion rights and reproductive justice advocates were ready for this moment. Advocates and organizers stepped up immediately to keep access available where they could and to press for expanding access where possible. Direct aid networks are active in ensuring patients have access to the resources necessary to get an abortion. But this is not a sustainable model, and everyone knows it. It's a tourniquet, and the entire abortion care system is at risk of bleeding out.\n\nAnd the evangelical right knows it, too. They are only getting more emboldened, already laying the groundwork for a national abortion ban should they take power following the 2024 election. And they are listening to Justice Clarence Thomas' calls to revisit other key sexual privacy precedents, from the right to use birth control to the right to exist in out queer relationships .\n\nWith Roe gone, we're all wondering: Where do we go from here?\n\nTo help answer that question, Imani Gandy turned to one of the icons of the abortion access movement, Judith Arcana, one of the original members of Chicago's underground pre- Roe abortion service, featured in a new documentary called The Janes . Lisa Needham offers up a blueprint for democracy reform as an answer to Democratic officials worried about institutional preservation. Meanwhile, Laurie Bertram Roberts reminds us all that investing in Black organizers is the only way to build our way to a better future.\n\nThe overturning of Roe has already changed the practice of medicine in a few short weeks. Garnet Henderson spoke with advocates across the country who are innovating their practices to get around draconian abortion bans. And in this piece , T.S. Mendola explores what it would take for hospitals to take a more active role in abortion care.\n\nBecca Andrews traveled to Alabama to report on the scramble folks made there to simply deliver reproductive health care in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court decision. And finally, we all know that a dramatic increase in the surveillance and carceral systems are one part of the post- Roe reality. Madison Pauly highlights the district attorneys vowing not to prosecute abortion bans.\n\nThis moment is fraught, but we will build something better than Roe . There is simply no other choice.\n\nTop image credits: Courtesy Judith Arcana; Probal Rashid/LightRocket/Getty; Anna Moneymaker/Getty; Unsplash; Getty\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "SCOTUS Finally Made It Official: Roe Is Dead\n\nMother Jones illustration; Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty\n\nWell, folks, the decision is here.\n\nAs expected, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 in favor of bypassing the precedents established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade and 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey rulings and upholding a law passed by Mississippi in 2019 that bans abortion at 15 weeks. The opinion nullifies the constitutional right to an abortion and significantly weakens the right to privacy, which will likely spell more trouble ahead for contraceptive rights and LGBTQ+ rights. More immediately, 13 states have trigger laws on the books that will ban abortion immediately. (The procedure is already banned in Oklahoma , which didn't even wait for SCOTUS to rule.)\n\nToday's ruling gutting abortion rights has been expected since early May, when Politico published a leaked draft of the opinion , in which Justice Samuel Alito declared, \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\" That sentiment stands.\n\nThe right to abortion has been on the books for half a century. But two generations of conservative legal activism primed the Supreme Court for today's tectonic decision, and with the fall of Roe , former President Trump secured a defining moment for his far-right legacy: It was his appointees who finally tipped the balance on the court, and ensured this ruling's majority.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito's majority opinion fundamentally rejected the idea that Roe should remain under the doctrine known as stare decisis , the concept that protects legal precedent. \"We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion,\" Alito writes. \" Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nWhile Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the majority, he issued a concurring opinion that differed by saying that the majority's argument did not require the court \"to take the dramatic step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in Roe.\"\n\nThe three liberal justices, writing in dissent, decried the decision for discarding \"a known, workable, and predictable standard in favor of something novel and probably far more complicated,\" setting states against each other, and producing innumerable legal battles to come. \"The majority's response to these obvious points exists far from the reality American women actually live,\" they wrote.\n\n\"This morning, the radical Supreme Court is eviscerating Americans' rights and endangering their health and safety,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a swiftly convened press conference. \"Today the Republican-controlled Supreme Court has achieved its dark extreme goal,\" she said, laying the blame at the feet of Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell, accusing them of \"criminalizing health freedom.\"\n\nShe also warned of a nationwide abortion ban if Republicans win both houses of Congress in November.\n\nImmediately, activists on both sides descended on the Supreme Court Friday morning to celebrate and protest. Liberal and progressive leaders across the country scrambled to pull together legal responses to ensure the continuation of the right to abortion in their states.\n\nRead the full opinion here .\n\nThis is a breaking story.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Realize That the End of Roe Is About More Than Abortion\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty\n\nIn the week since the Supreme Court revoked the constitutional right to abortion, President Biden urged people to vote. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said abortion rights are on the ballot. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said electing more pro-choice Democrats would help restore abortion rights.\n\nBut none of the top Democrats who control two of the three branches of government acknowledged their own power to do much of anything now, including confronting the democratic failures that have brought the United States to this unprecedented place: Justices appointed by presidents elected by a minority of Americans taking away a popular right essential to equality and autonomy for half the population.\n\nOnly a handful of progressives are placing the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in the context where it belongs: America's fraying democracy. \"The ruling is Roe , but the crisis is democracy,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tweeted Saturday. \"Leaders must share specific plans for both.\"\n\nSeveral additional progressives in Congress have called for expanding the Supreme Court and abolishing the filibuster to restore abortion rights with federal legislation. Yet no one in Democratic leadership seems to be talking publicly about these possibilities. Despite the dire consequences of Roe v. Wade 's demise for millions of Americans, there's almost no urgency from those at the top to propose much of anything other than yet more requests that people vote in November.\n\nTo understand the Democrats' political response to the end of Roe, I spoke with Anat Shenker-Osorio, a progressive messaging consultant, about how to talk about abortion in this new era. Shenker-Osorio has advised both the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the House Democratic Caucus, and also helped craft messaging for campaigns in both Ireland and Australia to repeal abortion restrictions. We spoke just a few hours after the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on Friday about the politics of abortion and how Democrats are failing to connect abortion rights to other freedoms. (The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nAs someone who studies messaging and advises Democrats, how are you thinking about what needs to happen next?\n\nOne of the things that we learned from the [2018] Irish campaign to repeal the ban on abortion in Ireland, which was massively successful, was \"someone you love.\" Someone you love will need an abortion someday. And that idea that actually, \"Guess what? This is going to impact you, whether your physical body or you via the connection that you have with a sibling, with a co-worker, or with a friend. Someone you love. This is your issue.\"\n\nAnd then the other [message], which is not contradictory, is that abortion has to be situated inside of a broader framework, which is the idea that Trump Republicans want to take away our freedoms. From our freedom to vote and pick leaders who represent us in free and fair elections to our freedom to decide for ourselves whether and when we have children, to our children's freedom to learn the truth of our history, to our freedom to not be plagued by gun violence. They want to take away our freedoms and rule only for the wealthy white few. We have to draw this exceptionally stark contrast in November between the worlds that the majority of Americans of different political affiliations desire and what this right wing authoritarian faction is doing.\n\nSo what you're saying is basically that people should be talking about the end of abortion rights as part of a larger agenda?\n\nCompletely. And I think that what we're seeing right now, for example, with the January 6 [hearings], is this effort to essentially rule over and not represent us. And so that's another rhetorical way to draw the connection for people. We see in our research that this is something that people understand: that [the right wing] is hell-bent on overturning the will of the people, whether that be through violent insurrection or through five secretive people in black robes, or through state legislatures that are silencing people's voices and taking away their votes. They want to overturn the will of the people.\n\nThere are some people in the Democratic tent who have been talking about democracy and the connectedness of all of these things. AOC is an example. But it doesn't seem like the party more broadly or its leaders have wanted to describe this as an issue of democracy. You're saying they should push further into that territory?\n\nThe word \"democracy\"-not the concept, but the word-is not a particularly helpful one. It's far too abstract for people to feel any kind of visceral attachment to it. And let's just be honest with ourselves: For many, many people in our country, including core elements of the Democratic base, they've never experienced a democracy. We don't live in a democracy.\n\nSo when people say things like, \"We need to step up and protect our democracy\" or, \"We need to ensure the future of our democracy,\" that both rings hollow for a great number of audiences and, that's just not true. You can't protect the thing you don't have. You can say things like, \"realize the promise of our democracy,\" or \"finally have the democracy that we deserve.\"\n\nBut democracy is not that particularly helpful of a word, because democracy never bought anybody dinner. It doesn't connect back to the things that are top of mind for people. And so what do you need to do? You need to draw these broader connections, but you need to attach it back to what feels tangible to people. [Democrats] need to bring it back to what is this going to mean for what I need in my life, and that's not what the word democracy does, unfortunately.\n\nDo you find a receptive audience when you talk about constructing these broader narratives? Or does it feel like the Democratic Party is doing this piecemeal?\n\nThere are state-based groups and even state-based parties that have absolutely embraced this kind of overarching connective tissue. For example, Stacey Abrams obviously does this brilliantly. Does it happen more broadly? There are leaders in the Democratic Party who do it some of the time, I think that it's increasingly on display in the discourse from and about the January 6 criminal conspiracy. But generally speaking, w hen we're talking about abortion, we're talking about abortion. When we're talking about education, we're talking about education. When we're talking about fill in the blank, we're talking about fill in the blank. And yeah, that's completely a mistake.\n\nThat's something that the right has demonstrated and perfected. They have an overarching concept, like Make America Great Again, and that is a signaling mechanism with which they can talk about every single issue. Make America Great Again is a discourse that has something to say about taxes, has something to say about schooling, has something to say about work, has something to say about immigrants, etc. So having an overarching message or an overarching value proposition into which we can then slot our arguments about every particular issue is incredibly important.\n\nComing back to abortion, a majority of Americans support Roe and support access to abortion care. The fact that Roe has been overturned is not because people don't approve of it. It's not because a majority of the people voted for the president who appointed the justices who overturned it. It must be frustrating trying to get people to vote on an issue that shouldn't even have to be a thing because the majority is already there for it.\n\nYou just handily, compactly explained how we don't live in a democracy.\n\nIs that why it has to be discussed as a democracy issue? Because the majority is already there and exists?\n\nIt's a very hard story to explain to people. The casino is rigged. The house always wins. And yet we need you to come back to the casino and place another bet. And we're going to explain to you how you need to place another bet by giving you an explanation of just how thoroughly the casino is rigged.\n\nWhat we have to do is draw this exceptionally stark contrast between what [voters] believe in, what they want for themselves, for their country, for their children, etc and this authoritarian faction that is hell-bent on taking away our freedoms. So we can't make an abstract argument about democracy itself. We have to highlight the democracy concept by talking about things like your freedom to decide who governs in your name, your kids' freedom to learn the truth of our past, your kids' freedom to be who they are without intimidation, and their freedom to go to school without fearing they're going to be shot in some mass killing.\n\nWith Roe gone, do you see an opportunity to talk about abortion in a different way? While, again, acknowledging the futility that you shouldn't have to be talking about it in a different way because a majority of people already support abortion rights.\n\nThere was a choice made once upon a time to argue Roe on privacy grounds and not equity grounds. What that sounded like in messaging was \"US, out of my uterus. Keep your laws off my body. My child, my choice.\" That was the second wave feminist refrain: a privacy argument that relies upon a libertarian framework that says, in essence, that government is an interfering terrible force. The reproductive justice critique that was made long, long ago by Black women scholars and leaders was about the inadequacy of that approach. [The privacy approach] delivered us the Hyde Amendment. If you're making the argument that this is an issue in which government doesn't belong, then, alright, well, we're not going to force insurance companies to pay for it. And we're not going to provide it as part of any kind of national programs. And we're not going to make state-based medical schools train practitioners in how to do this.\n\nWithout relying on this libertarian framework, how can you discuss abortion as a right?\n\nYou say: \"Someone you love will need an abortion some day and what will you do then? What will they do then?\" We need to turn out in record numbers to ensure that Trump Republicans cannot take away our freedoms and the freedoms of our loved ones.\n\nA majority of people have supported [abortion rights] for a while. And that got us here. So in order to make this a turnout issue, Democrats have to convince people that turning out actually will manifest in some change. [Showing them that] when Democrats retain the House majority and grow the Senate majority, these are the ways that we are going to ensure care for your family, and have your freedom and rights respected.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Wade decision, which for half a century offered women and families the privacy and protection to choose when, where and how to have children. Since its overturn in June 2022, the Roe anniversary is a stark reminder, both of all that has been lost, but also of some small gains for women's agency, freedom and power as Americans.\n\nSince Roe was overturned, nearly two dozen states have seriously curtailed or completely banned abortion.\n\nAs a result, women in those states with restricted access have faced an array of life threatening, catastrophic health consequences. Even worse, in almost every state with abortion bans, already unacceptably high maternal mortality rates have increased .\n\nIn Ohio a woman was hauled before a grand jury and accused of murder after her miscarriage. Thankfully, the grand jury declined to indict. In several instances, women have come close to death from complications after being denied abortions. Even the supposed legal exceptions for the life of the mother have failed. Take Kate Cox, for example, who sued in Texas to access an abortion when she faced life threatening complications. Texas courts denied her request and she was forced to leave the state to get care.\n\nAnd many doctors  are giving up even trying to practice in states with abortion bans, driven away by government control of their practices and their oath to \"do no harm,\" exacerbating an already acute healthcare crisis. And now, as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on access to the abortion pill, there's reason to worry that the worst of the consequences are still yet to come.\n\nIndeed, the landscape since the end of Roe has been a grim one for women. And it has laid bare the agenda of far-right legislators across the country who are still not content with even the most extreme abortion restrictions.\n\nGiven all this, it seems almost impossible to fathom that anything positive was gained by women in the overturning of Roe. But there may be some small outcomes to celebrate.\n\nFor a generation, many Americans believed abortion was sacrosanct and would never be overturned, which led to a fair amount of political apathy. While women have out-voted men in every election since 1980, abortion was more of an animating issue for those who opposed it than those who supported it. In fact, the highly effective and powerful Christian conservative political movement was built almost entirely on the vision of repealing Roe. Opposition to abortion helped propel Reagan, Bush 41 and 43 and Trump to the presidency, all of whom pledged to - and did --  appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court justices.\n\nToday, though, voters are acutely and newly aware that if Roe can be overturned, other rights we take for granted, including gay marriage, birth control and more, might also be at risk. As a result, numerous polls, including those from All In Together, the women's civic education organization I co-founded and lead,  have found that  support for abortion rights has not only become a top voting issue for women on the left and middle, it has overwhelming support among a significant majority of Americans.  Even Republican women have been driven to vote in favor of abortion rights when given the chance. Ballot initiatives protecting abortion access like those passed in Kansas, Ohio, Michigan have been huge engines for galvanizing voter turnout across the political spectrum.\n\nTo be clear there is no \"silver lining\" to the rollback of Roe, which opened an essential door to women's full place in American society with vast impact on American life.  But it has served as a wake-up call  to Americans that no progress is guaranteed and that we as citizens and voters must always be vigilant stewards of our individual freedoms and rights. And given the galvanizing political force the end of Roe created it seems possible that it was also a political wakeup call to elected officials that women's rights must urgently be defended.\n\nIt took 50 years for activists to repeal Roe, and it will most certainly take many years to restore it. Let's hope that it remains the kind of deeply personal issue of freedom, justice and equality that continues to mobilize Americans well into the future. Women's lives depend on it.\n\nLauren Leader is the co-founder and CEO of All In Together. She is a frequent contributor to Know Your Value.

It could still get much worse.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nToday is the 51st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision . Until last year's anniversary, we could commemorate how far we have come in the fight for equality. But now, we are reminded of just how much freedom we have lost .\n\nThe overturning of Roe in June 2022 meant a swift and brutal transition for those living in states governed by extremists. Health centers were shuttered. Doctors faced jail time for honoring their Hippocratic oath. And patients were abandoned.\n\nDonald Trump and the MAGA Republican Party have made their views clear: They are proud to have denied health care to pregnant women.\n\nFor those who could travel to get the care they needed, it meant fleeing from their homes and across state lines to get abortion care. Often, that brought the threat of a bounty on a spouse or friend who helped them make the trip.\n\nFor those who couldn't travel, it meant enduring a health care system that no longer prioritized their well-being. It meant being forced to continue a pregnancy, no matter the stakes or risks.\n\nIn Tennessee, a woman excited to grow her family was denied a lifesaving abortion because a trigger ban had gone into effect that same day. As a result, she had to undergo an emergency hysterectomy - preventing her from ever having another child.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a mother of three learned that her pregnancy was nonviable and had resulted in a rare cancer. Still, her doctors' hands were tied. She was told to wait in the parking lot for her condition to deteriorate before she could get the medical help she needed.\n\nIn Florida, a hopeful mom-to-be's water broke 16 weeks into her pregnancy. She rushed to the emergency room. But the doctors could only offer antibiotics, send her home, and promise to pray for her. She lost half the blood in her body before she could get treatment and escape death.\n\nWhen Republicans dismantled our constitutional abortion rights, they struck a catastrophic blow against women's freedom and dignity.\n\nThis is the dangerous, daily reality of Americans living in the 21 states where abortion rights have been restricted or abolished since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nThe remaining 29 states make up another America where abortion is still legal and where health care remains the jurisdiction of doctors, not politicians.\n\nBut 2024 represents a crossroads where that could change.\n\nDonald Trump and the MAGA Republican Party have made their views clear: They are proud to have denied health care to pregnant women , and they intend to enact a nationwide ban on abortion that voids any state law codifying reproductive rights.\n\nThey have already rushed toward that goal with lawsuits seeking to impose a national ban on the abortion pill and overturn the right to receive emergency medical care. The GOP has filed legislation criminalizing interstate travel - while rallying more than 190 House Republicans to vote against access to birth control .\n\nThey will not stop until every woman in every state, county and ZIP code is forced to surrender their bodily autonomy to politicians.\n\nWhen Republicans dismantled our constitutional abortion rights, they struck a catastrophic blow against women's freedom and dignity - against the very idea that our lives are of equal value. Right-wing abortion bans, book bans and drag bans are all wrapped up in the same dangerous belief that a certain kind of person is more worthy than another.\n\nThis year's election will determine whether that ideology seeps into every corner of the country or whether we start regaining ground toward equality. We must vote for freedom.\n\nKatherine Clark, the Democratic whip, represents Massachusetts' 5th Congressional District in the House of Representatives.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Wade abortion protections\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWASHINGTON - Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked legislation led by Democrats to revive the protections of Roe v. Wade in the wake of the Supreme Court eliminating the nationwide right to abortion .\n\nThe vote was 49-44, falling short of the super-majority needed to defeat a filibuster due to broad opposition from Republicans, who dismissed it as a political stunt.\n\nThe Reproductive Freedom for Women Act, introduced last month around the second anniversary of the court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, is just a few sentences long. It states that \"protections for access to abortion rights and other reproductive health care\" after the 2022 ruling \"should be supported.\" It adds that \"the protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade ... should be restored and built upon, moving towards a future where there is reproductive freedom for all.\"\n\nIt's part of a series of reproductive rights bills that Senate Democrats, who narrowly control the chamber 51-49, have forced votes on ahead of the 2024 elections.\n\n\"Will Republicans stand with the majority of Americans, stand with the mainstream, and stand against Donald Trump by affirming a woman's fundamental right to choose?\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the vote.\n\n\"Of course, many Republicans would rather sweep reproductive health under the rug, saying it's political, but this is not political,\" he said. \"This is the essence of what elected government is like. We all know these issues are deeply personal to so many people. And Americans ought to be able to see how their senators vote.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Susan Collins, R-Maine, were the only Republicans to vote in favor of the measure. Schumer switched his vote to \"no\" in the end for procedural reasons, to preserve his option to bring up the bill again in the future.\n\nSenate Democrats have attempted to put Republicans in a bind between the wishes of their conservative base and the majority of the U.S. - with recent votes on supporting legal access to abortion, contraception and IVF .\n\n\"We call this the summer of Schumer shows votes,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., calling the measure symbolic and declaring ahead of the vote that it had \"no possibility of ever becoming law\" and was crafted as a political messaging vehicle for Democratic candidates.\n\nI'm a reporter for NBC News covering Capitol Hill, elections and the intersection of politics and public policy in Washington.

Here's how to fight back.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nSunday marks 50 years since the landmark Roe v Wade Supreme Court decision, which secured women's constitutional right to an abortion - or so we thought.\n\nSince last year's decision to overturn Roe, abortion access has been banned or severely restricted in dozens of states. Partially to blame for this catastrophic outcome is a breakdown in our democratic system. The good news is there is a path to regain reproductive rights and make our entire system stronger.\n\nWhile it took nearly half a century for abortion rights opponents to secure their victory with the Dobbs decision this past summer, it took mere days for the consequences to rear their ugly head.\n\nIn Texas, pregnant women with complications have nearly died or, in one case, have been forced to carry a dead fetus for weeks because doctors were restricted from administering critical care. And in Ohio, a 10-year-old child was forced to cross state lines to obtain an abortion after she was raped. There's also the devastating economic and personal consequences for millions of women who are now forced to have children they cannot afford or do not want.\n\nThe Institute for Women's Policy Research also found that restrictive abortion laws cost state and local economies $105 billion annually by reducing work force participation and earnings levels, while also increasing time off and turnover among women between the ages of 15 and 44 years old.\n\nThe consequences for democracy are also serious. Women cannot be full and equal members of society without the freedom to make choices about their bodies and their futures. Forcing women to bear children against their will, subjecting them to potentially horrifying medical trauma and possible economic turmoil repress women's freedom and ability to contribute to society and democracy.\n\nThe barriers to abortion access today are a direct result of a broken democratic system. The most glaring example is the Supreme Court. In the Dobbs decision, five majority opinion justices (John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney-Barret) were appoin­ted by Presidents Bush and Trump who lost the popu­lar vote .\n\nMeanwhile, in 2016, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell weaponized Senate procedure to block then-President Obama's Supreme Court appointment of Merrick Garland - though Obama was twice elected to the presidency with overwhelming support in both the popular and electoral college votes.\n\nI believe the entire Senate confirmation process for Supreme Court Justices is problematic. Several justices, notably Justice Kavanaugh, assured senators they would not upend established precedent and did so anyway. Unsurprisingly, the latest polling shows American confidence in the Supreme Court is at an all-time low.\n\nWith abortion relegated to the states, another glaring problem with our democracy has come into stark view: Gerrymandered, unrepresentative state legislatures that have made abortion illegal in so many states. Wisconsin is a perfect example. There, the state legislature, which passed an abortion ban after the Dobbs decision, has a large Republican majority , even though the majority of voters in the state voted for Democrats in recent elections .\n\nAnd when it comes to representative government, there are just 32 percent women in state elected office. In Texas, it's barely 20 percent. Around the country, many male-dominated state legislatures are passing abortion restrictions their constituents do not want. In fact, as the Kansas constitutional fight over abortion proved, if given a choice, most voters, even in red states, want abortion access preserved.\n\nThe good news is that there is a path to restoring abortion rights, which would also strengthen our entire democratic system. And while it might seem pie-in-the-sky to enact these critical reforms, it's certainly worth working toward.\n\nHow?\n\nFirst, it's time to abolish the electoral college so that presidential elections are truly the will of the people.\n\nSecond, it's time to depoliticize the Supreme Court by reforming its structure. The constitution does not specify that there be nine justices and in the past there have been more. By expanding the court to include more members, as some have proposed , it could become less virulently partisan.\n\nThird, Democrats must win control of the entire legislative branch to protect abortion rights (entirely within reach in 2024).\n\nFourth, we must be willing to forgo the filibuster and pass federal abortion protections.\n\nFifth, we need a more serious national effort to tackle gerrymandering in state legislatures so that representation is proportional to party affiliation.\n\nAnd finally, it's time to elect more women to office at the state and federal level.\n\nAll these solutions, while difficult to achieve, are worth fighting for. As Americans come to terms with what it means to have lost on Roe, a bedrock of autonomy and liberty for women, there is an opportunity to turn disaster into opportunity. But first we must really grasp all of what is at stake: nothing less than democracy itself.\n\nLauren Leader is the co-founder and CEO of All In Together.

Wade\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Steve Benen\n\nAs recently as 2015, most Americans not only supported reproductive rights , they saw no real need to be concerned about those rights' disappearance. After all, even Republicans kept telling voters that Roe v. Wade 's future was not in jeopardy.\n\nEven as leading progressive voices tried to raise alarm about what was poised to happen, the public didn't really believe it. The week after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Dobbs case, a Politico/Morning Consult poll found that nearly two-thirds of the public \"either said they didn't know how likely the court was to overturn Roe or said the court isn't likely to overturn the precedent.\"\n\nWith this in mind, I suspect there will be millions of Americans who learn of Roe 's demise today, and they'll be absolutely dumbfounded. \"Wait,\" they'll say. \"The Supreme Court just took away a constitutional right? A legal foundation that's existed for a half-century is gone? How did this happen?\"\n\nLooking back over the last several years, five things happened.\n\n1. The 2016 blockade . Circling back to our earlier coverage , it was in February 2016 when then-Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly. Then-President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a center-left, compromise jurist - who'd received praise from Senate Republicans - to fill the vacancy. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and his conference instead decided to impose an unprecedented high-court blockade for nearly a year, hoping that Americans might elect a Republican president and Republican Congress despite the GOP's abusive tactics. It worked: McConnell effectively stole a Supreme Court seat from one administration and handed it to another.\n\n2. Trump was elected in 2016 . With the Supreme Court even divided, with four justices on the right and four justices on the left, Democrats tried to tell voters the 2016 election was a historic, once-in-a-generation opportunity to stop the high court's drift to the right. Just enough Americans voted for Donald Trump anyway, helping set the stage for today's ruling.\n\n3. Changing the rules for Gorsuch . As of early 2017, Senate rules still permitted filibusters for Supreme Court nominees. Given the GOP's 2016 blockade, Senate Democrats weren't about to treat Neil Gorsuch's nomination as a routine matter. Senate Republicans responded by executing the so-called \"nuclear option\" and confirming the conservative jurist anyway.\n\n4. From Kennedy to Kavanaugh . Justice Anthony Kennedy, ignoring concerns about Trump's corruption and radicalism, retired and gave the incumbent president another opportunity to fill a high court vacancy. Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who faced fairly broad public opposition and bipartisan opposition in the Senate. The Republican majority confirmed him anyway. A month later, voters rewarded the Senate GOP, slightly expanding its majority.\n\n5. From RBG to ACB : In September 2020, then-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and according to her family, her dying wish was that the Senate would wait to confirm her successor until after the election. Republicans nevertheless scrambled to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, ignoring all of the principles they pretended to care about four years earlier regarding filling vacancies in an election year, and confirmed the conservative during the early voting period.\n\nSoon after, voters elected a Democratic White House and a Democratic Congress, but by that point, it was too late - the 4-4 split that existed on Election Day 2016 had given way to a six-member, far-right majority that could effectively do as it pleased on any issue.\n\nTo be sure, this summary is truncated. The fight over reproductive rights unfolded over decades, and there have been a great many important developments that unfolded outside of these five points.\n\nBut when your gobsmacked friends and relatives wonder aloud about Roe 's demise, these five turning points represent a good place to start.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Wade to its ultimate protector\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nREHOBOTH BEACH, Del. - Standing outside Joe Biden's church in this seaside town, the Rev. William Cocco mulls a question the president has grappled with over his long political career: How does a practicing Catholic defy church teaching and come out in favor of abortion rights, as Biden has done?\n\n\"I think it's very difficult to reconcile that,\" Cocco said in an interview this month after he presided over a service at St. Edmond Roman Catholic Church. \"Life is a gift from God.\"\n\nBiden would have been at Mass that day, lining up for communion with the other parishioners, but he hurried back from his vacation home for meetings about Iranian plans to attack Israel.\n\nAn irony of Biden's final campaign is that one of the most vexing issues he has ever confronted personally - abortion - is now central to his political survival. Biden's campaign and his entire party have made abortion a defining issue in his re-election bid, hoping to rally female voters alarmed by Republican efforts to roll back reproductive freedoms.\n\nThe young Catholic politician who once said the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling that safeguarded abortion rights \" went too far \" - and who to this day remains uneasy with the procedure - is casting himself as the only thing standing between women and strict national abortion bans.\n\nHe vows to chisel Roe's protections into law if he's re-elected and secures friendly majorities in Congress, quashing a GOP-led push to forbid most abortion procedures. On Tuesday, Biden is scheduled to  give a speech in Tampa, Florida condemning the state's new six-week abortion ban.\n\nJennifer Klein, director of the White House's Gender Policy Council, recalls Biden's reaction upon hearing that the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nThinking through the decision in the Oval Office, \"he was angry,\" Klein said in an interview. \"He went quickly to the fact that this had never been done before and the Supreme Court had never overturned a fundamental freedom. He also went immediately to what might come next: If they take away this right, what other rights would be under attack?\"\n\nBiden may have little choice but to put abortion rights front and center. He is running about even with Donald Trump in the polls, despite Trump's myriad legal troubles. Voters largely don't know about Biden's legislative victories, nor do they credit him with strong economic growth, opinion surveys show.\n\nBiden needs something to jolt the electorate and galvanize voters who may feel his candidacy is uninspiring. Many allies see abortion as the answer. Polls suggest that voters already trust him on the issue. Asked which of the two candidates is closer to their views on abortion and same-sex marriage, 48% of registered voters in Pennsylvania - a key swing state - chose Biden, compared with only 35% who picked Trump, a Franklin & Marshall College poll this month found.\n\nHoping to ensure women retain access to abortion and, as a bonus, juice voter turnout in November, Democrats have been filing ballot measures that would enshrine abortion rights in Arizona and other battleground states. And Biden's campaign has gone all in, churning out ads , news releases and social media posts casting him as a stalwart defender of the abortion-rights movement.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has pushed reproductive rights as a top issue in his state and founded a nonprofit group that is supporting abortion referendum efforts in multiple states, predicted abortion could \"absolutely\" decide November's election.\n\n\"There's a strong portion of the Biden coalition that is motivated on the issue and a strong group of people who might otherwise have stayed home but for the fact that the Dobbs decision [overturning Roe] came down and now this is a major threat to people all over the country,\" Pritzker said in an interview.\n\nBiden's 50-year evolution from Roe skeptic to Roe adherent mirrors that of many Americans and the Democratic Party itself. The party's presidential platform in 1972 - the year Biden was first elected to the Senate - carried not a single mention of abortion. By 2016, the year Hillary Clinton was the party's nominee, the platform was chockablock with vows to defend abortion rights to the hilt.\n\nThe issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n\n\"One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,\" said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\n\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting \" a child \" rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\n\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went \"too far,\" he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\n\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\n\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: \"Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.\"\n\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event .\n\n\"I happen to be a practicing Catholic,\" he said. \"I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.\"\n\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\n\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\n\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n\n\"Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,\" said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. \"He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.\"\n\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position - wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square - was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, \"Promises to Keep.\"\n\nThat proved prescient.\n\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\n\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n\n\"I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,\" said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. \"I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion .\n\n\"I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,\" she added. \"It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.\"\n\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n\n\"Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,\" said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. \"I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.\"\n\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\n\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n\n\"He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,\" Bracey Sherman said. \"I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.\"\n\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories - but has yet to hear back.\n\n\"He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,\" she said. \"But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?\"\n\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\n\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n\n\"There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,\" said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\n\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\n\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n\n\"The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,\" said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. \"He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: 'Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.'\"\n\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\n\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\n\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a \"good presence\" during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\n\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n\n\"As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, 'You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\n\nPeter Nicholas is senior White House reporter for NBC News digital.\n\nI am a politics reporter covering campaigns and issues affecting voters.

Wade may not have been the right case to protect abortion rights\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe latest battle over abortion rights highlights the stark truth that bans and severe restrictions on abortion harm women - physically, economically and mentally . It also highlights an important truth: Roe v. Wade may not have been the right case to protect abortion rights, which are and should be seen as equality rights protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ( just as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted ) rather than a privacy right protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nLaws that restrict abortions and therefore regulate pregnancy should be seen as sex-based classifications.\n\nFive women sued the state of Texas this week based on the claim that the state's severely restrictive abortion laws endangered their lives. The experience of Amanda Zurawski, one of the women who brought the case, is instructive. In the suit, she alleges that prior to a doctor agreeing to perform an abortion to end a pregnancy that was no longer medically viable, she had to wait until she developed blood poisoning. Zurawski, in case anyone is wondering, reportedly underwent over a year of fertility treatments to be able to have a child.\n\nZurawski is but one example. As one study concluded , barring women from obtaining abortions has real health effects: \"Women who gave birth had potentially life-threatening complications, such as eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage , whereas those having abortions did not.\"\n\nAnd beyond the very real physical risks of forced birth, at least one major study found that women who sought and were denied abortions were \"more likely not to have enough money to cover basic living expenses like food, housing, and transportation.\" In addition, these women experienced lower credit scores, higher debt and more bankruptcies. Remind me again how a bill that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, like the one proposed in Florida , is \" pro-family .\"\n\nIt didn't have to be this way. The Supreme Court could have decided, decades ago, that abortion rights should be protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead, the high court concluded in Roe v. Wade that abortion rights are protected under a different portion of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause .\n\nThe difference between protecting abortion rights under one part of the Fourteenth Amendment instead of another might sound like an abstract legal concept. But it actually has huge real-world consequences. If abortion rights had been properly viewed as protected under the Equal Protection Clause, this should have had two major consequences. First, the decision to protect abortion rights would have, arguably, stood on firmer legal ground than Roe. Second, we would have properly seen abortion rights as what they are: rights that allow women to be equal participants in our society.\n\nWe can never know for sure what might have been, but at one point there was a different path for the Supreme Court. In Roe , the court famously concluded that abortion rights are privacy rights protected under the Due Process Clause. In Dobbs v. Jackson , the decision overturning Roe, the court said that one of the reasons Roe was wrong is that nothing in the text of the Constitution specifically mentions either the right to privacy or the right to an abortion.\n\nThe road not taken was, at least arguably, more strongly grounded in the text of the Constitution. It involved a case, championed by Ginsburg when she was a practicing attorney. That case involved an Air Force regulation which required that women who became pregnant had to face immediate discharge or get an abortion. Ginsburg's client didn't want either option, and Ginsburg argued that the Air Force's rule violated her client's Equal Protection rights. Because the text of the Fourteenth Amendment specifically references \"equal protection of the laws,\" that case could have offered firmer textual grounding to the right to an abortion.\n\nThe decision to protect abortion rights would have, arguably, stood on firmer legal ground than Roe.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. But then, likely knowing they were about to lose, the Air Force changed its rule . As a result, the court concluded that the case was moot. A month later, the court handed down its decision in Roe.\n\nWe will never know if today's very conservative Supreme Court, so insistent on overturning Roe, would have been just as willing to overturn a case protecting abortion rights based on gender equality, not privacy rights. But there's an additional reason for us to think about reproductive choice as falling under more than just a right to privacy: Reproductive choice is fundamentally about allowing women to be full members of our society.\n\nWhen the government bans or severely restricts abortions, the government burdens women in a radically different way than it does men. Laws that restrict abortions and therefore regulate pregnancy should be seen as sex-based classifications. Under the court's current framework , a law that creates a sex-based classification can only survive if the government could show that it furthers an important government interest and does so in a way that is substantially related to that interest.\n\nAs one amicus brief submitted in the Dobbs case notes, Mississippi, relying on outdated stereotypes about women, \"failed to explore the many less discriminatory and noncoercive ways to reduce abortion and to protect the life and health of women and future generations - such as by providing appropriate and effective sex education or assisting those who wish to bear children.\" If equal protection under the law is to have real meaning for women, it should include the access to abortions.\n\nIf the government can force women to give birth, the government can force women to be subject to physical, economic and emotional harms that men are not. As a very different Supreme Court noted in 1992 , \"[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.\"\n\nEconomic and social life, of course, doesn't even account for life, period. Pregnancy is not without risks, some pregnancies more than others. More women will almost certainly die because of the government's decision to deny women access to abortions. It didn't have to be this way.\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the \" Passing Judgment \" podcast.

Wade remains law, but the Supreme Court isn't acting like it\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nA majority of the Supreme Court is acting more like a political body than a judicial one. Its treatment of Texas' abortion law and its looming decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , which will for the first time overturn a case that provides a constitutional right, is merely part of the court's lurch toward political activism.\n\nA majority of the Supreme Court is acting more like a political body than a judicial one.\n\nOn Thursday, the court allowed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to flout its December ruling that the federal case brought by abortion providers in Texas could continue against the medical licensing professionals. Instead, the Supreme Court blessed yet another delay tactic by Texas, which argued that its own Supreme Court should hear the case first. Specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court just denied the Texas abortion providers' petition to force the 5th Circuit to return the case to the district court. This means the abortion providers' challenge will not proceed in federal trial court for now but will first go to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nIt might seem strange that the conservative majority of the court is allowing the 5th Circuit to view its opinions as mere suggestions, not mandates. But it makes sense when we take a step back and realize this is about the court allowing Texas to delay challenges to its abortion law until the court erases abortion rights from the Constitution and the challenge to Texas' law becomes moot. Justice Sonia Sotomayor summarized the consequence of the court's decision in one sentence: \" This case is a disaster for the rule of law and a grave disservice to women in Texas, who have a right to control their own bodies .\"\n\nOur system of government depends on each branch performing a different role. The legislative branch makes laws. The executive branch enforces them. The judicial branch decides if those laws are valid. There is plenty of overlap and messiness when it comes to the separation of powers, but that is the basic three-pillared structure of our government.\n\nHow do we know that judges are not just politicians in robes? What distinguishes a judicial body from a political one? Stare decisis , \"to stand by things decided,\" a doctrine that tells judges to respect case precedent, is one part of the answer to that question.\n\nJudges are supposed to adhere to past legal decisions, even if their predecessors or colleagues made them. Of course, there are rare instances in which courts should reverse course and overturn a decision. But judges owe us a good reason for pulling the rug out from under us after we have relied on a decision. The purpose of the doctrine of stare decisis is to make sure that the development of the law is predictable and reliable. And, perhaps even more importantly, to make us respect what judges do as not merely being about their personal philosophies or political goals, but about an even-handed application and development of the law.\n\nThe majority of the current Supreme Court seems not particularly concerned with as preserving the public's respect for what judges do.\n\nThe majority of the current Supreme Court seems not particularly concerned with minor inconveniences such as preserving the public's respect for what judges do, at least not when it stands in the way of its near-inevitable decision to erase the right to obtain an abortion from the Constitution. Exhibit A, the long and winding road littered with challenges to Texas' abortion ban.\n\nThe time for polite euphemisms is over. Let's be blunt. Texas passed an unconstitutional ban on abortions. And the Supreme Court, which, let's say it one more time, is charged with striking down laws that violate the Constitution, is aiding and abetting Texas' behavior. The Supreme Court appears to be comfortable allowing states to flout its precedents (the cases ruling that there is a constitutionally protected right to obtain an abortion) because it is about to overturn those precedents anyway.\n\nTo go back to the beginning: Texas passed a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and it outsourced enforcement of that law to private individuals. Abortion providers challenged the law, correctly pointing out that it flies in the face of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey . They ultimately filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, asking the court to do what it should do: prevent an unconstitutional law from going into effect. Instead, the court functionally overturned Roe and Casey with silence. It did nothing for days, allowing the law to be in effect. Then when it finally did speak, it essentially threw up its hands and said the enforcement mechanism was so complicated that it would just let the illegal law remain in effect. The court would wait, it said in not so many words, for a case that specifically addressed who could be sued in a suit to stop enforcement of the Texas law.\n\nSo challengers to Texas' law teed up a case that directly addressed that very question: Who, if anyone, can be sued in a federal court in a case challenging Texas' law? In response to that suit, the court did two things that signaled its callous indifference to abortion rights. First, it said only one group, the Texas medical licensing officials, were the proper defendants for such suits, which narrowed the ability of challengers to sue in federal court to stop an unconstitutional law from remaining on the books. Second, while the court said that the challenge by abortion providers could go forward against the medical licensing professionals, it failed to stay the law while that case continued . Meaning the court once again allowed the unconstitutional law to stay in effect.\n\nThe court deciding Thursday that the 5th Circuit could ignore its December decision and divert the case to the Texas Supreme Court is the latest twist in this saga.\n\nWhere does this leave us? A majority of the court has now acted as accomplices in Texas' illegal attempt to ban abortions. Of course, based on everything the court has done and failed to do with respect to Texas' law, it seems increasingly clear the court stands ready to eviscerate abortion rights in this country.\n\nBut make no mistake. This won't end with abortion. It was never going to end with abortion. Look for the Supreme Court to blatantly ignore or contort its past precedent in order to achieve its goals in other areas like rolling back rights for members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the \" Passing Judgment \" podcast.

Wade. What followed was a religious crusade that's dominated law and politics, culminating in last summer's decision overruling Roe in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization .\n\nOf course, we had a good idea of what was going to happen in Dobbs the month before the ruling came out, when Politico published a leaked draft of Justice Samuel Alito's opinion tossing federal abortion rights - and decades of precedent - aside. We knew for sure when the opinion was issued on June 24, 2022, with five Republican appointees voting to overturn Roe: Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. (Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion that didn't go as far as his GOP colleagues but still would have further curtailed abortion rights.)\n\nThe reality is that abortion opponents don't want the court to stay out of the issue.\n\nPredictably, the loss of federal abortion rights caused a series of nightmare scenarios across the country, with red states pushing bans and 2022 becoming what the Guttmacher Institute , a research organization that supports reproductive rights, called \"a devastating year for abortion rights and reproductive health generally.\" Most abortions are banned in at least 13 states, according to The New York Times' tracker . And though they won't pass through the Senate or the White House, the newly minted Republican majority in the House is pushing for further restrictions .\n\nAnd it's important to remember what it can mean when abortion is banned: Not only is health care unavailable, it's criminalized. For example, questions were raised in Alabama recently over whether the attorney general was in favor of imprisoning women for taking abortion pills. The mere possibility of such a thing is a function of the supposedly benign act of \"sending the issue back to the states,\" as abortion opponents have framed the Dobbs decision.\n\nIndeed, Republicans have felt at the polls the public's general disgust with the extreme ruling. After all, a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Even former President Donald Trump, who appointed three of the justices in the Dobbs majority during his presidency, acknowledged the issue's negative impact on Republicans politically in last year's midterm elections, posting on his Truth Social platform afterward:\n\nIt wasn't my fault that the Republicans didn't live up to expectations in the MidTerms. I was 233-20! It was the \"abortion issue,\" poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother, that lost large numbers of Voters. Also, the people that pushed so hard, for decades, against abortion, got their wish from the U.S. Supreme Court, & just plain disappeared, not to be seen again. Plus, Mitch stupid $'s!\n\nAnd that's just the damage that Dobbs itself has wrought - which, to be clear, cannot be overstated. There's no guarantee that's the end of the road even for the Supreme Court. The logic of Alito's Dobbs opinion is the court purporting to stay out of the issue. But on top of that approach feigning ignorance of the court's power and impact on society, the reality is that abortion opponents don't want the court to stay out of the issue.\n\nRather, they want the court to affirmatively ban abortion through so-called fetal personhood , as opposed to just allowing states to choose whether to ban it or not. The Supreme Court turned away an appeal pressing the personhood argument last year . And it would be inconsistent with Dobbs for the Supreme Court to embrace the fetal personhood argument. But Dobbs overruled long-standing precedent in Roe, so we can't assume that the court will be consistent about an issue on which it hasn't been consistent.\n\nJordan Rubin is the Deadline: Legal Blog writer.

Was there still a chance Chief Justice John Roberts would work out some kind of compromise that left the status quo partially intact?\n\nThe answer, we learned this morning, was no. Roe is no more. NBC News reported :\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion in a 6-3 vote, a momentous break from a half century of rulings on one of the nation's most controversial issues. About half the states have already indicated they would move to ban the procedure.\n\nThe fact that we knew to expect this doesn't make it any less devastating for those who support American reproductive rights.\n\nThe ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was 6-3, with each of the Republican-appointed justices voting in the majority, though it was not a clean split: Roberts concurred in the judgment, though he also said he wouldn't have overturned Roe .\n\nOf course, with a six-member conservative majority, the other Republican-appointed justices didn't need the chief justice's vote.\n\nIn case this isn't obvious, it's probably worth emphasizing that today's ruling in Dobbs does not altogether end abortion rights in the United States. What it does instead is end the constitutional right: States can now choose to impose restrictions on reproductive rights without concern for the Roe precedent.\n\nThat said, this is cold comfort for millions of families nationwide: We're now faced with the prospect of millions of women having to travel out of state for reproductive health care, if they can afford it. What's more, there's nothing stopping Republicans from trying to pass a federal abortion ban, curtailing reproductive rights in states regardless of their wishes.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, \"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nAs a practical matter, abortion rights will now disappear in roughly half the country.\n\nQuoting an earlier ruling, the Supreme Court's three dissenters wrote, \"Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Court's decision making.\" Justices Stephen Breyer, Elana Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor added:\n\n\"Roe has stood for fifty years. Casey, a precedent about precedent specifically confirming Roe, has stood for thirty. And the doctrine of stare decisis - a critical element of the rule of law - stands foursquare behind their continued existence. The right those decisions established and preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both originating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily integrity, personal autonomy, and family relationships. The abortion right is also embedded in the lives of women - shaping their expectations, influencing their choices about relationships and work, supporting (as all reproductive rights do) their social and economic equality. Since the right's recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed to support what the majority does today. Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have provided any new reasons to reach a different result than Roe and Casey did. All that has changed is this Court.\"\n\nThey concluded with a word not usually seen in high court rulings.\n\n\"With sorrow - for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection - we dissent.\"\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Wade , or aim for something better?\n\nWhen the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June, abortion opponents weren't the only ones ready to embrace a world beyond it. Dr. Colleen McNicholas, for one, had presided over the last abortion clinic in Missouri, where doctors performed fewer than 100 abortions in the year before Roe fell. The state restrictions allowed under Roe , including a 72-hour waiting period, meant that most Missourians seeking abortions were already traveling out of state for care. Erika Christensen, for another, had learned in 2016 , when she was 30 weeks pregnant, that her fetus wouldn't be able to breathe outside the womb. Since her home state of New York had criminalized abortion after 24 weeks, she flew to Colorado and paid $10,000 for an injection to end her pregnancy.\n\n\" Roe is the floor, not the ceiling\" was a call first issued by reproductive justice activists, but it became a movement rallying cry, emblazoned on T-shirts and posters. Even mainstream groups like Planned Parenthood used that message to press for expanded abortion access, fighting against state-level restrictions and for Medicaid coverage of abortion. Then the floor dropped out. Yet even as they mourned, many providers and activists were ready to build something better.\n\n\" Dobbs has given us an opportunity,\" said one prominent abortion provider, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"It has wiped away 50 years of bullshit, legally.\"\n\nRoe had hinged on a dividing line that even its author, Justice Harry Blackmun, acknowledged was arbitrary . Feeling a need to allow states to ban abortion at some point in pregnancy, Blackmun considered the end of the first trimester before settling on \"viability,\" when, he wrote , a fetus \"presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\" After viability, the Roe decision said, the state had a \"compelling\" interest in fetal life and could enact restrictions on abortion to that end.\n\nThis framework downgraded the rights of a pregnant person after fetal viability, ignoring the reasons someone might seek an abortion later in pregnancy. A recent study by Katrina Kimport found that there are two main reasons for abortions after 24 weeks-new information, such as a serious fetal health diagnosis, or barriers to abortion earlier in pregnancy, such as cost and finding a provider. These barriers have only grown since Dobbs and were already highest for low-income people of color. \"You don't get an abortion later in pregnancy unless something really bad has happened,\" said Dr. Diane Horvath, a cofounder of Partners in Abortion Care, one of three clinics in the country that routinely provide care after 28 weeks. In the months since Dobbs , Republicans have doubled down on their claim that Democrats want to permit \"abortion up until birth,\" painting their opponents as extremists in spite of the fact that the Republicans are responsible for overturning a 50-year-old constitutional right. But \"this idea that people carelessly have abortions later in pregnancy-it's a false narrative, and it's a really deliberate attempt to vilify people who need abortions later in pregnancy and the people who provide them,\" Horvath said. \"These decisions are never better made by legislators or by voters than they are by pregnant people working with their health care providers.\"\n\nRoe itself showed just how imperfectly legal lines translate into medical reality. Viability, Horvath explained, is less like a line than a window, ranging from about 24 to 28 weeks, when, depending on fetal development and access to specialized equipment, a fetus might survive outside the womb. Nonetheless, it has long been accepted as a bright line marking the cutoff for legal abortion even in many blue states . After Roe , lawyers for clinics felt compelled to defend viability as a \" principled line \" in order to prevent the courts from moving that line even earlier. Post-24-week abortions were relegated to a handful of clinics in the minority of states that allowed them. A pervasive stigma, bolstered by pro-choice support for the Roe framework, crystallized around later abortions. Even as the movement used Christensen's story, published by Jezebel in 2016, to demonstrate the wrenching harm of abortion restrictions, they could also cite Roe as an excuse not to pursue policies that would help people in her predicament.\n\n\"Now it's time to honor those stories,\" said McNicholas, a member of the governing affairs committee at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri. \"We do that by rebuilding a system in a way that makes sure that other patients don't have to sustain those same injuries.\"\n\nBut the architects of the most promising and well-funded efforts to save abortion access in states where abortion is banned, restricted, or under threat are pushing measures that use Roe 's viability framework. In five of these states -Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and South Dakota-citizens have proposed ballot measures to restore or protect abortion access in 2023 or 2024. Four of the current versions of these proposals would enshrine a state's right to ban abortion after viability or, in South Dakota's case, at the end of the second trimester. In the fifth state, Missouri, where there's a legal battle over the inflammatory ballot language proposed by the Republican secretary of state, the ballot language has not been finalized, but advocates are entertaining versions that would allow the Legislature to ban abortion after viability or 24 weeks. Proponents of these compromises told me they see them as a form of harm reduction. In states like Missouri and South Dakota, where abortion is banned, and Arizona and Florida, where 15-week bans are in effect, advocates feel an urgency to restore the status quo under Roe .\n\nFlorida's proposed initiative, which also leaves in place the state's parental notification requirement, \"returns the status in Florida to what it was in terms of our ability to access the health care up until the point of viability,\" Kara Gross, the legislative director of the Florida ACLU, told me. In Florida, the bar for passing a ballot initiative is particularly high; voters approved a legislative proposal to raise the threshold to 60 percent in 2006.\n\n\"Everything that we have seen shows that these protections for access to abortion are what the people in Florida need, and want, and support,\" Gross said.\n\nBut many providers and reproductive justice activists have grown frustrated with this defensive approach. With ballot measures offering the greatest hope of restoring abortion access in many red states, they worry that the movement is repeating the mistakes of the past rather than prioritizing those most affected by abortion restrictions. \"When we, as a movement, were on the defense, it was easy to say that abortion bans are bad and abortion bans disproportionately affect the most marginalized,\" McNicholas told me. \"When we are now in a position to take the offense...where we have an opportunity to rebuild with our values at the center...our own internalized stigma is still showing its face.\"\n\nDr. Jenni Villavicencio, an abortion provider and public policy expert, agreed. \"We have been freed from the chains that Roe put on us, because that is exactly what that was,\" Villavicencio told me. \"And we are facing a very real conversation about 'What actually is reproductive justice? What actually is abortion access?' And we are not meeting that moment.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nLast November, Michiganders demonstrated just how popular abortion rights have become. Voters there passed an initiative enshrining reproductive freedom in the state Constitution with 57 percent of the vote, while reelecting pro-choice Governor Gretchen Whitmer and handing the Democrats full control of the state Legislature for the first time in 40 years.\n\nBarely noticed in the fanfare over the initiative's success was the compromise at its core. The measure allowed the state to \"regulate\" abortion after viability, although any ban at that stage would need to make exceptions for a pregnant person's \"life or physical or mental health.\" To many advocates, this compromise didn't seem important-after all, Michigan has long had such restrictions. But as states across the country follow Michigan's example, some advocates see enshrining viability bans in state constitutions as a missed opportunity.\n\n\"When we're talking about amending state constitutions, these are meant to create and sustain long-standing rights and freedoms and should be insulated from the changing political winds,\" said Andrea Miller, the president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health (NIRH). In a recent piece for Elle , Miller wrote of the imperative to leave the Roe framework behind for good: \"Until those who support abortion rights reckon with the compromises that the Roe framework created and stop white-washing history, we'll never build a just and equitable future,\" Miller wrote.\n\nA few states have taken that vision to the polls. Vermont enshrined in its Constitution a sweeping right to reproductive freedom with no limit; 77 percent of voters supported it in November 2022 despite anti-abortion messaging that claimed it would allow abortion up until the day of birth. California's reproductive freedom amendment, passed with 67 percent of the vote, didn't mention viability explicitly, though it's unclear exactly how the ballot measure squares with the state's existing viability ban. Amendments initiated by state lawmakers in Maryland and New York, where abortion is legal but restricted later in pregnancy, do not mention viability. In Colorado, where abortion is not restricted based on gestational age, activists are pursuing an amendment to end the state's ban on Medicaid funding of abortion. \" Dobbs fundamentally changed everything, and it put Colorado abortion rights advocates on the offensive,\" Karen Middleton, president of Cobalt, told me in a statement. Oklahoma activists are discussing a potential ballot measure to repeal the state's total ban; the question of whether to include a viability ban is an active part of that conversation, participants said. Advocates in Oregon, where there are currently no gestational limits on abortion, told me they're already planning a citizen-initiated amendment to protect those rights as well as to protect people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation for 2026. \"Part of the reason we're looking at a longer timeline is, we want to continue doing this deep movement-building work in our state,\" Cassie Purdy, the political director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, told me. Activists in the famously progressive state say that their success at protecting abortion and LGBTQ rights is not an accident of demographics, but rather the result of bold organizing and deep canvassing on issues like Medicaid coverage for abortion and gender-affirming care that succeeded in pushing voters to the left on these issues.\n\n\"Oregon has the best abortion policy in the country, and it is among the states with the best LGBTQ protections in the country,\" Blair Stenvick, the communications manager of Basic Rights Oregon, told me. \"No, we didn't get there by accident.\"\n\nBut proposals in Florida, Arizona, and Ohio are following Michigan's example. Ohio's initiative has been certified for the ballot this November; Florida advocates are still gathering signatures for 2024. The Ohio initiative allows abortion to be \"prohibited\" after viability, defined as \"the point in a pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient's treating physician, the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures.\" South Dakota's proposed ballot language for 2024 is even narrower, allowing state lawmakers to \"regulate\" abortion after the first trimester in what proponents call a \"literal codification of Roe .\" The local Planned Parenthood affiliate has opposed the language, telling The Nation in a statement: \"We don't believe it will adequately reinstate the right to abortion in South Dakota.\"\n\n\"A restoration of Roe is popular here with the voters of South Dakota,\" said Adam Weiland, cofounder of Dakotans for Health, which is leading the effort to gather signatures to get the measure on the 2024 ballot.\n\nIn Missouri, activists are pushing a measure to overturn the state's total ban in 2024. Some of the 11 versions of the measure under consideration would allow the state Legislature to ban abortion after \"viability\" or 24 weeks of gestation; some explicitly maintain the state's ban on government funding of abortion; and some allow for parental consent laws. \"Nobody wants medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion,\" said Mallory Schwarz, the executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, formerly known as Pro-Choice Missouri. But she feels an urgency to act. \"We have an opportunity now to make a transformative change in the abortion-access landscape in Missouri that we don't know if we'll have in the future, as evidenced by the continued attacks on the initiative-petition process.\"\n\nPamela Merritt, the executive director of Medical Students for Choice, a group that has taken an unapologetic stance against viability limits, grew up in Missouri. She said this strategy feels shortsighted, aimed at swaying moderate voters for a short-term win rather than building long-term power. In July, Merritt decided to stop participating in discussions about the ballot initiative in Missouri over concerns about the restrictive language in 10 of the 11 proposed versions.\n\n\"I feel very confident that we are not going to build towards liberty, and towards a world where bodily autonomy is upheld for all people, by proactively accepting restrictions in an effort to appease the same voting bloc...of suburban white moderate women who, honestly, are the reason why we had the restrictions that led to the ultimate loss to begin with,\" Merritt said.\n\nOn June 21, leaders from Naral, Planned Parenthood, and the reproductive justice organization SisterSong gathered for a press call on Zoom to mark the first anniversary of the Dobbs decision. During the Q&A session, I asked each of the leaders about the pros and cons of including viability bans in ballot initiatives.\n\nMini Timmaraju, president of NARAL, demurred on the viability question, saying, \"We're a national org; we defer to our state and local partners about the solution they need to craft for their community.\" As I finished asking my question, I heard a ding. Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood, had dropped off the call. Facilitators interjected, telling me she had another call; then staff followed up with a statement that Planned Parenthood had already sent to my colleague T.S. Mendola acknowledging that \"viability limits are arbitrary\" before deferring to state-based groups to make decisions based on their differing \"political climates.\"\n\nOn the call, Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong, echoed Timmaraju's sentiment. \"I think we're going to have to continue to just grapple with the ways in which we use [ballot initiatives] the most effectively...and really [make] that decision with community, with leaders, with folks who are on the ground in those states,\" Simpson said. \"We are at a place right now where we literally have to run and think about every possible strategy, every possible tool that we can use in order to not only win back but to also think about the opportunities for advancing some proactive measures and strategies.\"\n\nAndrea Miller of the NIRH, a group that works closely with state and local partners across the country, has taken a more pointed stance. \"Just please don't make the assumption from the jump that the only way to win these is to make those compromises,\" Miller told me. \"And, at the very least, have a really honest dialogue about who's being left behind and what to do about that.\"\n\nAt the forefront of this conversation, somewhat surprisingly, is the leading professional network of ob-gyns, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Founded in 1951, ACOG has more than 60,000 members and issues guidelines that form the standard of care for the profession. While ACOG opposes abortion restrictions on the grounds that they interfere with evidence-based care, researchers in April revealed that ACOG's political action committee had donated $1.3 million to anti-abortion lawmakers . In 2022, the organization approved an updated policy on abortion that includes the line: \"ACOG strongly opposes any effort that impedes access to abortion care and interferes in the relationship between a person and their healthcare professional.\"\n\nEven this statement was not without controversy. Sources within the organization said it involved immense effort from members who demanded a clear stance opposing viability bans as well as \"knock-down, drag-out fights\" during meetings. Then, in April, almost a year after ACOG approved the statement, the group's Ohio division seemed to go against it, endorsing Ohio's ballot language in a statement that referred to viability bans as \"reasonable limits.\" \"This common-sense amendment will restore and protect the vital reproductive rights that were guaranteed by Roe v. Wade for fifty years,\" Dr. David Hackney, the chair of ACOG Ohio, and Dr. Amy Burkett, the immediate past chair, wrote in the statement.\n\nACOG typically does not allow its state divisions to contradict its policy statements. But the ACOG board had held a closed-door meeting where it agreed to permit the Ohio division to break with national policy, sources in ACOG said. Some in the organization were furious about this compromise, but Hackney said he saw it as a way to preserve the greater good. Most important, he wanted to fend off the Ohio law that makes performing an abortion after six weeks a felony , which is on hold pending a lawsuit. \"The net benefits of the [amendment] far outweigh the exact concerns regarding the viability language,\" he said. \"Having looked at the specter of potential criminal charges\" under the six-week ban, Hackney added, \"I would take this in a second.\"\n\nDoctors like Diane Horvath were furious. \"When...an organization of my peers calls a viability ban 'common sense,' I feel like they're throwing my patients under the bus; they're throwing me under the bus,\" Horvath said. \"These are the same people who will send patients to me when their patients need post-viability care.\" Hackney, a maternal fetal medicine specialist, acknowledged that he does send patients with fetal anomalies who are beyond Ohio's current 22-week limit to clinics like Horvath's. \"I do understand her point, and there were a lot of conversations along these lines,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, ACOG president Dr. Verda Hicks acknowledged that ACOG's members \"are not immune\" to differences of opinion \"about how best to restore access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care.\"\n\n\"ACOG strongly discourages the inclusion of viability in legislation or regulation,\" she added. \"Viability is a complex and nuanced concept that is often misused by those that oppose access to abortion care.\"\n\nFollowing their ordeal, Erika Christensen and her husband, Garin Marschall, became activists for the cause of abortion without government interference. They successfully helped to push New York in 2019 to decriminalize abortion and expand the exceptions that would allow it after 24 weeks. But polling data was always a sticking point. Even within the abortion rights movement, the prevailing wisdom has been that the public supports abortion access early in pregnancy and supports restrictions later on. The latest Gallup poll shows that in the wake of the Dobbs decision, a record-high 69 percent of people support the legality of first-trimester abortions, but that support drops to 37 percent for second-trimester abortions and to 22 percent for third-trimester ones.\n\nBallot measures are the most direct reflection of public opinion that our political system allows, so proponents of these initiatives care intensely about polls. \"What we keep hearing in all these states-Ohio, Michigan, etc.-is that viability must be included, because that's what the polling says,\" Marschall told me during a recent Zoom call.\n\nBut Christensen and Marschall suspected that after Dobbs , with the public deeply skeptical of state overreach, these trends might have shifted. They worked with the polling organization PerryUndem to put together a survey that would test these assumptions. Pollsters contacted 4,000 people of all political stripes across the country, concentrating most heavily on Arizona, where Marschall and Christensen now live and where advocates are pushing a ballot measure for 2024.\n\nHalf of the sample received the Michigan ballot language, which explicitly allowed the state to regulate abortion after viability. The other half got the same language but with the line about viability removed. Conventional wisdom suggested that the language allowing a viability ban, which researchers called the \"viability ballot,\" would get more support. But that's not what happened. Instead, the viability language fared worse; there was a 15-point drop in people who said they would \"definitely\" vote for the measure with the viability language included.\n\nDuncan Gans, senior research analyst at PerryUndem, sent the results to his boss, Tresa Undem, who told him they must be wrong. Gans agreed. He thought perhaps the inputs for the two measures had somehow gotten swapped. So he double-, triple-, and quadruple-checked. The results were right.\n\n\"There's a large portion of voters that don't want any state involvement in any decisions related to abortion, including after viability,\" Gans told me. Dozens of respondents left comments elaborating on this view. \"I do not want the state to have any say in denying an abortion, including after viability,\" one respondent said. \"I like everything about this amendment, except allowing the state to have any say in whether a woman gets an abortion or not,\" said another. \"I am totally against ANY KIND OF STATE INTERFERENCE to our bodies!\" said a third.\n\nThe poll results landed in Christensen's inbox while she was at her 6-year-old daughter's swimming lesson. On the side of the pool, as her daughter swam, Christensen began to weep.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe it,\" she told me. \"I had a third-trimester abortion, and I keep being told, over and over again, that everyone thinks I'm a murderer, and they're not with me, and they think my care should be criminalized, and that I should be turned away and have to travel,\" Christensen said. \"And then here I had pages and pages of people saying, 'No, fuck that.'\"\n\nKelly Hall prides herself on backing ballot measures that win. Prominently displayed on the website of her organization, the Fairness Project, is its track record of triumphing in 32 of the 34 ballot campaigns it has been a part of. Founded by SEIU United Healthcare Workers West in 2015, the Fairness Project worked on progressive initiatives to raise the minimum wage and expand Medicaid, including in red states like Arkansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Missouri, before getting involved in abortion last year. It has already spent more than $1 million promoting Ohio's November abortion ballot initiative and the campaign that successfully fended off an attempt to make that initiative harder to pass.\n\nThe Fairness Project has ruffled feathers among some longtime advocates of abortion rights because of what those advocates see as a focus on winning short-term victories rather than building long-term movements. Hall described the tension as perennial in political organizing: \"How much could you achieve with the electorate that you have right now, with the resources you have right now? And is that worth doing? Or should you wait and have a longer period of time with the status quo but the potential for a broader, more expansive policy in the future?\" Any decision to wait and build a base must be weighed against the uptick in Republican efforts to make it harder to pass ballot initiatives-like the effort Ohioans just defeated by a resounding margin in August, said Hall. Asked about the new polling that questions public support for viability bans, Hall downplayed the results, saying she thinks \"viability\" is a confusing term. In states with billboards promoting an embryo's \"heartbeat\" as a sign of life, she said, people might mistakenly think that a viability ban means a six-week ban. \"When people are confused, they are less likely to vote for something,\" Hall added.\n\nIn Ohio, the only state that will vote on abortion in 2023, it's a moot point: That ballot initiative would allow the Legislature to prohibit abortion after fetal viability, except to save the pregnant person's life or health. Some advocates worry that the Legislature will respond by redefining \"viability.\" Anti-abortion advocates have already telegraphed this strategy by calling embryos with cardiac activity \"viable\" and referring to 15-week abortions as \"late-term.\"\n\nIf the goal is to restore some measure of access as soon as possible, while boosting turnout among Democratic voters, then perhaps the viability compromise feels worth it. But advocates worry that once the national spotlight and the funding shift away, there won't be any political will left for the patients who were already left behind by Roe . Kansas, the first state to vote on abortion after Dobbs , is a perfect example of this dilemma. In August 2022, five weeks after Dobbs , Kansans resoundingly defeated an anti-abortion effort to repeal the state's constitutional right to abortion. But the vote did not touch the state's existing restrictions on abortion, including a 22-week ban, nor did it stop Republican lawmakers from passing new laws that make it a felony not to resuscitate a fetus that is \"born alive\" in an abortion procedure and that force providers to perpetuate the unproven idea that medication abortion can be \"reversed.\" The lesson for Dr. Christina Bourne, the medical director of Trust Women, which operates clinics in Kansas and Oklahoma, is that in the long fight for abortion access, it's important to know where you stand.\n\n\"Chipping away at your values is not how we normalize abortion access,\" Bourne told me. \"It gives [our opposition] a foot in the door to keep moving forward.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

(Bev Grant / Getty Images)\n\nIf you squint at it long enough, the abortion debate can look like an opportunity for conservatives to act like liberals-at least rhetorically. In arguing against abortion rights, conservatives cast themselves as brave advocates for an inconvenient moral truth. By standing up for the \"little guy\"-that is, the fetus-they claim to take the side of the oppressed. Like the most annoying of liberals, anti-choice conservatives can also treat this \"oppressed class\" as an ornament for their own self-regard, insisting that in their opposition to abortion rights, they provide \"a voice for the voiceless.\" Books in Review Roe: The History of a National Obsession By Mary Ziegler Buy this book This co-optation of the best and worst of liberal tendencies by the anti-choice movement is the subject of Mary Ziegler's new book, Roe: The History of a National Obsession , which surveys the rhetoric and arguments used by both sides of the abortion debate, beginning in the late 1960s-before the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, and before the issue became polarized along partisan lines-right up to Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health , the 2022 ruling that overturned Roe and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion. Along the way, Ziegler's book reveals how the anti-choice movement tried out and discarded a series of arguments in its search for a rationale that might appeal to judicial and general audiences alike. Her book can be understood as a history of the abortion as an argument, and how that argument has influenced American politics over the past half-century. A legal historian who teaches at the University of California, Davis, Ziegler has written six books on abortion and the law. Though she's unambiguously pro-choice, her work often aims to take a nuanced, more heterodox position on the issue, seeking to correct misconceptions about abortion's history and highlight areas of agreement on both sides. Her first book, After Roe , recounted abortion politics in the first decade following the decision, when pro- and anti-choice activists had more in common than today's readers might imagine. Her previous book, Dollars for Life , was a chronicle of the anti-choice movement's victories in fundraising and in capturing the judiciary. Dollars for Life was published last June; Ziegler is nothing if not prolific. She's also rigorous: Her books are stuffed with facts more than analysis, though they're sprinkled with just enough details about the major players involved to remind the reader that they were living human beings. But the strength of Ziegler's books lies in their abundance of historical detail, immersing the reader in information about larger social movements and politics. Like its predecessors, Roe: The History is a dates-and-names book, though it aspires (also like its predecessors) to illuminate a central question that the historical record alone cannot answer: Why did Roe v. Wade become such a political lightning rod? In its search for an answer, Roe pays meticulous attention to both the pro- and anti-choice sides. But Ziegler tends to focus more on the anti-choice movement, and it's not hard to understand why. As the ones trying to change the law-and the ones with the most fundraising power-anti-choice conservatives have evolved and adapted to events more quickly than abortion rights activists. Ziegler recounts the anti-choice movement's history to her largely pro-choice audience with the tone of someone who has recently returned from a trip to a faraway land: Let me show you how they do things in this strange place .

Ziegler reminds us that the abortion debate in the pre- Roe era was not strictly divided along party lines. Both the Republicans and the Democrats included among their numbers people who supported abortion rights and people who opposed them, for a variety of reasons that might be counterintuitive to many readers today. Some people supported abortion for religious reasons; some for racist ones. Some people opposed abortion as an extension of their commitment to Black liberation. But something like the contours of our modern abortion divide began to emerge in the 1970s, when, banking on a popular opposition to the women's liberation movement, a cadre of religious leaders and Republican strategists on the right-most notably Pat Buchanan-worked to radicalize evangelicals against abortion and turn it into a winning electoral issue. The strategy paid off: Opposition to abortion would become a central preoccupation of the Republican base, and the issue would help fuel the rise of the party and the religious right in the 1970s and '80s. But even as Republicans and religious conservatives were making their anti-choice positions the center of their politics, some opposition to abortion rights persisted on the left. As Ziegler tells us, in 1969 a small group of elite anti-abortion liberals founded Americans United for Life, which was intended to put a progressive, genteel, and charitable face on the anti-choice crusade. In contrast to those groups with a straightforward and avowed commitment to gender hierarchy and women's subordination-such as the National Right to Life Committee and, later, the violent Operation Rescue-Americans United for Life used the liberal rhetoric of rights and equality to argue for abortion bans under the rationale of fetal protection, appealing to that old left desire to stick up for the little guy. Current Issue View our current issue But the political battle lines around abortion would soon solidify, as the United States was plunged into a series of fiercely partisan battles over social issues during the Reagan era. People with liberal commitments found that they could no longer remain anti-choice; people with anti-choice commitments found that they could no longer remain liberal. Americans United for Life eventually fell into anti-feminist hands and became a rabidly right-wing group focused on ensuring Republican control of the judiciary. If the 1970s had opened with a still-lingering sense of uncertainty and discomfort among some liberals on the question of abortion, in the 1980s anti-choice conservatives began to draw the line: Even if liberals might have been sympathetic, this was now the right's cause. As the anti-choice movement veered more sharply to the right, it also became increasingly moralistic in its language and maximalist in its aims. In 1973, after the Roe decision, the National Right to Life Committee called for a constitutional amendment establishing fetal personhood. The proposition, which enjoyed support in Congress, would have criminalized abortion in all 50 states. But the pro-choice side, especially the large establishment-liberal groups like NARAL, were happy to fight on this territory. They depicted the proposed fetal-personhood amendment as not just extreme but anti-science, using Justice Harry A. Blackmun's opinion in Roe -which had gone long on medical technicalities and emphasized the rights of doctors, not women-to argue that the amendment substituted religion for medicine and backward superstition for forward-looking sophistication. This argument worked in part because, in the 1960s and early '70s, the pro-choice movement was populated less by activists than by doctors. In the early post- Roe years, the movement's main advocacy groups, such as NARAL, were associations of medical providers-respectable, educated, reformist, and largely male. The anti-choice side was no match for this bastion of credentialed professionalism, and the fetal-personhood amendment went nowhere. As a result of this early defeat, the anti-choice movement shifted to the strategy that it would continue to pursue into the 21st century: seeking not to ban abortion outright but instead to restrict it, making the procedure more and more expensive, humiliating, and onerous to get. The movement struck its first major blow in 1976 with the Hyde Amendment, a provision that banned the federal funding of abortion through Medicaid. The right to an abortion was thus immediately and drastically curtailed: Suddenly it was no longer an entitlement that every woman had, but rather an option that she could choose if she was able to pay for it. Meanwhile, the pro-choice movement was reinventing itself. What had long been associated with medical professionals was now increasingly dominated by feminists. These new pro-choice advocates saw themselves not as medical experts but as equal-rights activists. The feminist commitment to abortion rights emerged out of the women's liberation movement in the 1960s and '70s, in particular its anti-rape campaigns, which identified forced sex and forced pregnancy as two sides of the same coin. \"Tying Roe to liberty for women,\" Ziegler writes of the feminists who made abortion their cause in the late 1970s and early '80s, \"would legitimize the idea that women had the right to say no (or yes) to parenthood and pregnancy as well as to sex.\" As a result, the argument for choice was no longer just a matter of deference to medical practitioners' expertise and discretion, as Blackmun had outlined in Roe . Increasingly, abortion rights were about women's self-determination, their personal responsibility, and their individual freedom-those ideological buzzwords so often associated with the political right. T his role reversal, Ziegler observes, went both ways. The Roe decision marked the embrace by abortion rights activists of a rhetoric of independence and individual liberty that had long been advanced by the right. The ruling also upheld a vision of expansive federal power, including a judiciary that was able to undermine traditional social hierarchies such as gender with a stroke of its pen. Perhaps this is why the Roe decision inflamed so many on the right against the federal judiciary. Conservatives had already begun to target the courts in the wake of the major civil rights rulings of the 1950s and '60s. But after Roe , the judiciary took on a new importance in the conservative imagination, changing from an enemy to be hated into a tool worth capturing. Republican politicians spoke of the need to discipline the judiciary, to strip it of its jurisdiction over hot-button social issues; conservatives decried \"judicial activism\" and depicted federal judges as partisan hacks pursuing Democratic policy aims. This conservative resentment toward the judiciary lasted longer than one might think; well into the 2000s, it was the right that decried judicial capture and the left that championed the independence of the courts. But when the right set out to take control of the federal courts, Roe -and the determination to overturn it-was the main reason why. In the first decades after Roe , anti-choice conservatives also went on the offensive in other ways that mimicked some of the left's traditional habits. The abortion rights movement was vulnerable, after all, on race. Pro-choice proponents had never fully reckoned with the history of their cause-especially the fact that in its early years, birth control and abortion rights activism had at times attracted an unsavory smattering of eugenicists, \"population control\" enthusiasts, racists, and busybody social reformers with a prurient interest in the sex lives of the poor, immigrants, and the mentally ill. The right pointed to this history and argued that abortion rights were racist by their very nature; a popular 1988 evangelical book, Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood , claimed that the organization had been founded as part of a conspiratorial effort by racists to destroy the Black community. Less quackish anti-choice arguments pointed to the higher rates of abortion among Black women and suggested that Black communities had been offered abortion rights in lieu of other, more substantial rights and social programs oriented toward achieving equality. The anti-choice conservatives who made these arguments were, of course, not interested in the realities of Black women's social position; they saw no contradiction in calling for Black women to be free while denying them the freedom to control their bodies, or in saying that Black women deserved social welfare services that would be \"better than abortion\" while at the same time forming alliances with those who wished to gut the welfare state. But there were members of the Black community who were skeptical of the abortion rights activists, believing they held too narrow an understanding of Black women's needs, and it created a tension in the movement that has still not been resolved. The anti-choice movement also began to use medical science for its own purposes-and then to distort it. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe but replaced the 1973 trimester framework with a more subjective and contingent standard, \"viability\"-that is, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. The court ruled that states could ban abortion outright after \"viability\" had been achieved. But \"viability\" proved to be a slippery standard-the science around it was and remains unsettled, including the measure of what is viable from one pregnancy to another. In response to this new ambiguity, the anti-choice movement set about searching for pretexts to claim that abortion harmed not only fetuses but also women themselves, and it looked for ways to attribute viability or other physical advancements to the fetus that it didn't have. If the pro-choice side, with its physician-led advocacy groups, had claimed the mantle of science in the 1970s, the anti-choice movement tried to snatch it away two decades later. But even when the science didn't conform to their worldview, anti-choice conservatives pressed on anyway. Soon, states would pass laws that required abortion providers to read a litany of medical lies to women before performing the procedure, including empirically untrue statements such as that abortion causes suicide or increases the risk of breast cancer. R eading Ziegler's descriptions of these abuses of fact, it's hard at times not to hear irritation slipping through her normally staid prose. But Ziegler is a historian, not a polemicist, and for the most part she treats her subjects with scrupulous neutrality. One knows where her sympathies lie, but she is careful not to intervene in the story. For a book about abortion, it's an uncommon choice. But the result is that even some of the most passionate and polarizing people in Roe -for example, the millennial abortion \"abolitionists\" who congregate in a Chick-fil-A in Longview, Tex., to proclaim their willingness to break clinic protection laws-can come off with the blandness of saltines. Ziegler aspires to a rigorous facticity, yet her prose can be so dryly factual that it is hard at times for the reader to grasp the moral emergency presented by those facts. Ziegler's approach, however, also has its virtues. In the abortion debate, anti-choice activists-and more than a few judges-have cast feminist abortion rights supporters as hysterical. By contrast, Ziegler's dispassionate recounting of the debate's major arguments is instructive, because her calm and orderly tone gradually makes clear how much it is that passion, not logic and science, has been driving the anti-choice movement. Even when anti-choice conservatives invoke noble values-racial justice, religious freedom-they never make a credible case that abortion bans actually serve them. In this way, Ziegler offers us a methodical and fair-minded chronicle. But what is most apparent from reading it is that the anti-choice movement won its long fight to overturn Roe not because its side was more persuasive but because it focused more on obtaining power. Anti-choice conservatives have marshaled a broad array of arguments against abortion's legality, but whether they involve freedom or the judiciary, work or medical technology, race or religion, none of them have been successful in gaining broad popular support. When the anti-choice movement has won important victories, it has done so not because it made the best arguments but because it has captured the courts. For the most part, despite failing to bring the majority of people to its side, the anti-choice movement has been successful because of the federal judges who agreed with it. Dobbs and its gruesome, tragic aftermath seems poised to further the trend: The American public is now more pro-choice than it's ever been, and the more that people see what it's like to live without Roe , the more they miss it. Yet will the popularity of abortion rights matter? Will the more successful arguments of the pro-choice side ultimately make a difference? While Ziegler's book frames itself as the history of a national obsession, it is also a book about power and the brute fact that whoever wields it determines our public policies-policies that often bear little relation to public opinion. While liberals and the left have sought to win people over to their side, Ziegler documents that the abortion fight, from Roe to Dobbs , is actually a story about state capture. And maybe this is the real lesson of her book, the one those of us who believe in abortion rights would do well to heed: that there is no argument, no angle, no story of suffering or indignity that will bring the constitutional right to abortion back. The task, then, is not to argue, but to organize.\n\nBy Mary Ziegler\n\nBuy this book\n\nThis co-optation of the best and worst of liberal tendencies by the anti-choice movement is the subject of Mary Ziegler's new book, Roe: The History of a National Obsession , which surveys the rhetoric and arguments used by both sides of the abortion debate, beginning in the late 1960s-before the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, and before the issue became polarized along partisan lines-right up to Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health , the 2022 ruling that overturned Roe and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion. Along the way, Ziegler's book reveals how the anti-choice movement tried out and discarded a series of arguments in its search for a rationale that might appeal to judicial and general audiences alike. Her book can be understood as a history of the abortion as an argument, and how that argument has influenced American politics over the past half-century. A legal historian who teaches at the University of California, Davis, Ziegler has written six books on abortion and the law. Though she's unambiguously pro-choice, her work often aims to take a nuanced, more heterodox position on the issue, seeking to correct misconceptions about abortion's history and highlight areas of agreement on both sides. Her first book, After Roe , recounted abortion politics in the first decade following the decision, when pro- and anti-choice activists had more in common than today's readers might imagine. Her previous book, Dollars for Life , was a chronicle of the anti-choice movement's victories in fundraising and in capturing the judiciary.

But something like the contours of our modern abortion divide began to emerge in the 1970s, when, banking on a popular opposition to the women's liberation movement, a cadre of religious leaders and Republican strategists on the right-most notably Pat Buchanan-worked to radicalize evangelicals against abortion and turn it into a winning electoral issue. The strategy paid off: Opposition to abortion would become a central preoccupation of the Republican base, and the issue would help fuel the rise of the party and the religious right in the 1970s and '80s. But even as Republicans and religious conservatives were making their anti-choice positions the center of their politics, some opposition to abortion rights persisted on the left. As Ziegler tells us, in 1969 a small group of elite anti-abortion liberals founded Americans United for Life, which was intended to put a progressive, genteel, and charitable face on the anti-choice crusade. In contrast to those groups with a straightforward and avowed commitment to gender hierarchy and women's subordination-such as the National Right to Life Committee and, later, the violent Operation Rescue-Americans United for Life used the liberal rhetoric of rights and equality to argue for abortion bans under the rationale of fetal protection, appealing to that old left desire to stick up for the little guy. Current Issue View our current issue But the political battle lines around abortion would soon solidify, as the United States was plunged into a series of fiercely partisan battles over social issues during the Reagan era. People with liberal commitments found that they could no longer remain anti-choice; people with anti-choice commitments found that they could no longer remain liberal. Americans United for Life eventually fell into anti-feminist hands and became a rabidly right-wing group focused on ensuring Republican control of the judiciary. If the 1970s had opened with a still-lingering sense of uncertainty and discomfort among some liberals on the question of abortion, in the 1980s anti-choice conservatives began to draw the line: Even if liberals might have been sympathetic, this was now the right's cause. As the anti-choice movement veered more sharply to the right, it also became increasingly moralistic in its language and maximalist in its aims. In 1973, after the Roe decision, the National Right to Life Committee called for a constitutional amendment establishing fetal personhood. The proposition, which enjoyed support in Congress, would have criminalized abortion in all 50 states. But the pro-choice side, especially the large establishment-liberal groups like NARAL, were happy to fight on this territory. They depicted the proposed fetal-personhood amendment as not just extreme but anti-science, using Justice Harry A. Blackmun's opinion in Roe -which had gone long on medical technicalities and emphasized the rights of doctors, not women-to argue that the amendment substituted religion for medicine and backward superstition for forward-looking sophistication. This argument worked in part because, in the 1960s and early '70s, the pro-choice movement was populated less by activists than by doctors. In the early post- Roe years, the movement's main advocacy groups, such as NARAL, were associations of medical providers-respectable, educated, reformist, and largely male. The anti-choice side was no match for this bastion of credentialed professionalism, and the fetal-personhood amendment went nowhere. As a result of this early defeat, the anti-choice movement shifted to the strategy that it would continue to pursue into the 21st century: seeking not to ban abortion outright but instead to restrict it, making the procedure more and more expensive, humiliating, and onerous to get. The movement struck its first major blow in 1976 with the Hyde Amendment, a provision that banned the federal funding of abortion through Medicaid. The right to an abortion was thus immediately and drastically curtailed: Suddenly it was no longer an entitlement that every woman had, but rather an option that she could choose if she was able to pay for it. Meanwhile, the pro-choice movement was reinventing itself. What had long been associated with medical professionals was now increasingly dominated by feminists. These new pro-choice advocates saw themselves not as medical experts but as equal-rights activists. The feminist commitment to abortion rights emerged out of the women's liberation movement in the 1960s and '70s, in particular its anti-rape campaigns, which identified forced sex and forced pregnancy as two sides of the same coin. \"Tying Roe to liberty for women,\" Ziegler writes of the feminists who made abortion their cause in the late 1970s and early '80s, \"would legitimize the idea that women had the right to say no (or yes) to parenthood and pregnancy as well as to sex.\" As a result, the argument for choice was no longer just a matter of deference to medical practitioners' expertise and discretion, as Blackmun had outlined in Roe . Increasingly, abortion rights were about women's self-determination, their personal responsibility, and their individual freedom-those ideological buzzwords so often associated with the political right. T his role reversal, Ziegler observes, went both ways. The Roe decision marked the embrace by abortion rights activists of a rhetoric of independence and individual liberty that had long been advanced by the right. The ruling also upheld a vision of expansive federal power, including a judiciary that was able to undermine traditional social hierarchies such as gender with a stroke of its pen. Perhaps this is why the Roe decision inflamed so many on the right against the federal judiciary. Conservatives had already begun to target the courts in the wake of the major civil rights rulings of the 1950s and '60s. But after Roe , the judiciary took on a new importance in the conservative imagination, changing from an enemy to be hated into a tool worth capturing. Republican politicians spoke of the need to discipline the judiciary, to strip it of its jurisdiction over hot-button social issues; conservatives decried \"judicial activism\" and depicted federal judges as partisan hacks pursuing Democratic policy aims. This conservative resentment toward the judiciary lasted longer than one might think; well into the 2000s, it was the right that decried judicial capture and the left that championed the independence of the courts. But when the right set out to take control of the federal courts, Roe -and the determination to overturn it-was the main reason why. In the first decades after Roe , anti-choice conservatives also went on the offensive in other ways that mimicked some of the left's traditional habits. The abortion rights movement was vulnerable, after all, on race. Pro-choice proponents had never fully reckoned with the history of their cause-especially the fact that in its early years, birth control and abortion rights activism had at times attracted an unsavory smattering of eugenicists, \"population control\" enthusiasts, racists, and busybody social reformers with a prurient interest in the sex lives of the poor, immigrants, and the mentally ill. The right pointed to this history and argued that abortion rights were racist by their very nature; a popular 1988 evangelical book, Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood , claimed that the organization had been founded as part of a conspiratorial effort by racists to destroy the Black community. Less quackish anti-choice arguments pointed to the higher rates of abortion among Black women and suggested that Black communities had been offered abortion rights in lieu of other, more substantial rights and social programs oriented toward achieving equality. The anti-choice conservatives who made these arguments were, of course, not interested in the realities of Black women's social position; they saw no contradiction in calling for Black women to be free while denying them the freedom to control their bodies, or in saying that Black women deserved social welfare services that would be \"better than abortion\" while at the same time forming alliances with those who wished to gut the welfare state. But there were members of the Black community who were skeptical of the abortion rights activists, believing they held too narrow an understanding of Black women's needs, and it created a tension in the movement that has still not been resolved. The anti-choice movement also began to use medical science for its own purposes-and then to distort it. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe but replaced the 1973 trimester framework with a more subjective and contingent standard, \"viability\"-that is, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. The court ruled that states could ban abortion outright after \"viability\" had been achieved. But \"viability\" proved to be a slippery standard-the science around it was and remains unsettled, including the measure of what is viable from one pregnancy to another. In response to this new ambiguity, the anti-choice movement set about searching for pretexts to claim that abortion harmed not only fetuses but also women themselves, and it looked for ways to attribute viability or other physical advancements to the fetus that it didn't have. If the pro-choice side, with its physician-led advocacy groups, had claimed the mantle of science in the 1970s, the anti-choice movement tried to snatch it away two decades later. But even when the science didn't conform to their worldview, anti-choice conservatives pressed on anyway. Soon, states would pass laws that required abortion providers to read a litany of medical lies to women before performing the procedure, including empirically untrue statements such as that abortion causes suicide or increases the risk of breast cancer. R eading Ziegler's descriptions of these abuses of fact, it's hard at times not to hear irritation slipping through her normally staid prose. But Ziegler is a historian, not a polemicist, and for the most part she treats her subjects with scrupulous neutrality. One knows where her sympathies lie, but she is careful not to intervene in the story. For a book about abortion, it's an uncommon choice. But the result is that even some of the most passionate and polarizing people in Roe -for example, the millennial abortion \"abolitionists\" who congregate in a Chick-fil-A in Longview, Tex., to proclaim their willingness to break clinic protection laws-can come off with the blandness of saltines. Ziegler aspires to a rigorous facticity, yet her prose can be so dryly factual that it is hard at times for the reader to grasp the moral emergency presented by those facts. Ziegler's approach, however, also has its virtues. In the abortion debate, anti-choice activists-and more than a few judges-have cast feminist abortion rights supporters as hysterical. By contrast, Ziegler's dispassionate recounting of the debate's major arguments is instructive, because her calm and orderly tone gradually makes clear how much it is that passion, not logic and science, has been driving the anti-choice movement. Even when anti-choice conservatives invoke noble values-racial justice, religious freedom-they never make a credible case that abortion bans actually serve them. In this way, Ziegler offers us a methodical and fair-minded chronicle. But what is most apparent from reading it is that the anti-choice movement won its long fight to overturn Roe not because its side was more persuasive but because it focused more on obtaining power. Anti-choice conservatives have marshaled a broad array of arguments against abortion's legality, but whether they involve freedom or the judiciary, work or medical technology, race or religion, none of them have been successful in gaining broad popular support. When the anti-choice movement has won important victories, it has done so not because it made the best arguments but because it has captured the courts. For the most part, despite failing to bring the majority of people to its side, the anti-choice movement has been successful because of the federal judges who agreed with it. Dobbs and its gruesome, tragic aftermath seems poised to further the trend: The American public is now more pro-choice than it's ever been, and the more that people see what it's like to live without Roe , the more they miss it. Yet will the popularity of abortion rights matter? Will the more successful arguments of the pro-choice side ultimately make a difference? While Ziegler's book frames itself as the history of a national obsession, it is also a book about power and the brute fact that whoever wields it determines our public policies-policies that often bear little relation to public opinion. While liberals and the left have sought to win people over to their side, Ziegler documents that the abortion fight, from Roe to Dobbs , is actually a story about state capture. And maybe this is the real lesson of her book, the one those of us who believe in abortion rights would do well to heed: that there is no argument, no angle, no story of suffering or indignity that will bring the constitutional right to abortion back. The task, then, is not to argue, but to organize.\n\nDollars for Life was published last June; Ziegler is nothing if not prolific. She's also rigorous: Her books are stuffed with facts more than analysis, though they're sprinkled with just enough details about the major players involved to remind the reader that they were living human beings. But the strength of Ziegler's books lies in their abundance of historical detail, immersing the reader in information about larger social movements and politics. Like its predecessors, Roe: The History is a dates-and-names book, though it aspires (also like its predecessors) to illuminate a central question that the historical record alone cannot answer: Why did Roe v. Wade become such a political lightning rod? In its search for an answer, Roe pays meticulous attention to both the pro- and anti-choice sides. But Ziegler tends to focus more on the anti-choice movement, and it's not hard to understand why. As the ones trying to change the law-and the ones with the most fundraising power-anti-choice conservatives have evolved and adapted to events more quickly than abortion rights activists. Ziegler recounts the anti-choice movement's history to her largely pro-choice audience with the tone of someone who has recently returned from a trip to a faraway land: Let me show you how they do things in this strange place .

This conservative resentment toward the judiciary lasted longer than one might think; well into the 2000s, it was the right that decried judicial capture and the left that championed the independence of the courts. But when the right set out to take control of the federal courts, Roe -and the determination to overturn it-was the main reason why. In the first decades after Roe , anti-choice conservatives also went on the offensive in other ways that mimicked some of the left's traditional habits. The abortion rights movement was vulnerable, after all, on race. Pro-choice proponents had never fully reckoned with the history of their cause-especially the fact that in its early years, birth control and abortion rights activism had at times attracted an unsavory smattering of eugenicists, \"population control\" enthusiasts, racists, and busybody social reformers with a prurient interest in the sex lives of the poor, immigrants, and the mentally ill. The right pointed to this history and argued that abortion rights were racist by their very nature; a popular 1988 evangelical book, Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood , claimed that the organization had been founded as part of a conspiratorial effort by racists to destroy the Black community. Less quackish anti-choice arguments pointed to the higher rates of abortion among Black women and suggested that Black communities had been offered abortion rights in lieu of other, more substantial rights and social programs oriented toward achieving equality. The anti-choice conservatives who made these arguments were, of course, not interested in the realities of Black women's social position; they saw no contradiction in calling for Black women to be free while denying them the freedom to control their bodies, or in saying that Black women deserved social welfare services that would be \"better than abortion\" while at the same time forming alliances with those who wished to gut the welfare state. But there were members of the Black community who were skeptical of the abortion rights activists, believing they held too narrow an understanding of Black women's needs, and it created a tension in the movement that has still not been resolved. The anti-choice movement also began to use medical science for its own purposes-and then to distort it. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe but replaced the 1973 trimester framework with a more subjective and contingent standard, \"viability\"-that is, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. The court ruled that states could ban abortion outright after \"viability\" had been achieved. But \"viability\" proved to be a slippery standard-the science around it was and remains unsettled, including the measure of what is viable from one pregnancy to another. In response to this new ambiguity, the anti-choice movement set about searching for pretexts to claim that abortion harmed not only fetuses but also women themselves, and it looked for ways to attribute viability or other physical advancements to the fetus that it didn't have. If the pro-choice side, with its physician-led advocacy groups, had claimed the mantle of science in the 1970s, the anti-choice movement tried to snatch it away two decades later. But even when the science didn't conform to their worldview, anti-choice conservatives pressed on anyway. Soon, states would pass laws that required abortion providers to read a litany of medical lies to women before performing the procedure, including empirically untrue statements such as that abortion causes suicide or increases the risk of breast cancer. R eading Ziegler's descriptions of these abuses of fact, it's hard at times not to hear irritation slipping through her normally staid prose. But Ziegler is a historian, not a polemicist, and for the most part she treats her subjects with scrupulous neutrality. One knows where her sympathies lie, but she is careful not to intervene in the story. For a book about abortion, it's an uncommon choice. But the result is that even some of the most passionate and polarizing people in Roe -for example, the millennial abortion \"abolitionists\" who congregate in a Chick-fil-A in Longview, Tex., to proclaim their willingness to break clinic protection laws-can come off with the blandness of saltines. Ziegler aspires to a rigorous facticity, yet her prose can be so dryly factual that it is hard at times for the reader to grasp the moral emergency presented by those facts. Ziegler's approach, however, also has its virtues. In the abortion debate, anti-choice activists-and more than a few judges-have cast feminist abortion rights supporters as hysterical. By contrast, Ziegler's dispassionate recounting of the debate's major arguments is instructive, because her calm and orderly tone gradually makes clear how much it is that passion, not logic and science, has been driving the anti-choice movement. Even when anti-choice conservatives invoke noble values-racial justice, religious freedom-they never make a credible case that abortion bans actually serve them. In this way, Ziegler offers us a methodical and fair-minded chronicle. But what is most apparent from reading it is that the anti-choice movement won its long fight to overturn Roe not because its side was more persuasive but because it focused more on obtaining power. Anti-choice conservatives have marshaled a broad array of arguments against abortion's legality, but whether they involve freedom or the judiciary, work or medical technology, race or religion, none of them have been successful in gaining broad popular support. When the anti-choice movement has won important victories, it has done so not because it made the best arguments but because it has captured the courts. For the most part, despite failing to bring the majority of people to its side, the anti-choice movement has been successful because of the federal judges who agreed with it. Dobbs and its gruesome, tragic aftermath seems poised to further the trend: The American public is now more pro-choice than it's ever been, and the more that people see what it's like to live without Roe , the more they miss it. Yet will the popularity of abortion rights matter? Will the more successful arguments of the pro-choice side ultimately make a difference? While Ziegler's book frames itself as the history of a national obsession, it is also a book about power and the brute fact that whoever wields it determines our public policies-policies that often bear little relation to public opinion. While liberals and the left have sought to win people over to their side, Ziegler documents that the abortion fight, from Roe to Dobbs , is actually a story about state capture. And maybe this is the real lesson of her book, the one those of us who believe in abortion rights would do well to heed: that there is no argument, no angle, no story of suffering or indignity that will bring the constitutional right to abortion back. The task, then, is not to argue, but to organize.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nAnd strange it is. Ziegler reminds us that the abortion debate in the pre- Roe era was not strictly divided along party lines. Both the Republicans and the Democrats included among their numbers people who supported abortion rights and people who opposed them, for a variety of reasons that might be counterintuitive to many readers today. Some people supported abortion for religious reasons; some for racist ones. Some people opposed abortion as an extension of their commitment to Black liberation. But something like the contours of our modern abortion divide began to emerge in the 1970s, when, banking on a popular opposition to the women's liberation movement, a cadre of religious leaders and Republican strategists on the right-most notably Pat Buchanan-worked to radicalize evangelicals against abortion and turn it into a winning electoral issue. The strategy paid off: Opposition to abortion would become a central preoccupation of the Republican base, and the issue would help fuel the rise of the party and the religious right in the 1970s and '80s. But even as Republicans and religious conservatives were making their anti-choice positions the center of their politics, some opposition to abortion rights persisted on the left. As Ziegler tells us, in 1969 a small group of elite anti-abortion liberals founded Americans United for Life, which was intended to put a progressive, genteel, and charitable face on the anti-choice crusade. In contrast to those groups with a straightforward and avowed commitment to gender hierarchy and women's subordination-such as the National Right to Life Committee and, later, the violent Operation Rescue-Americans United for Life used the liberal rhetoric of rights and equality to argue for abortion bans under the rationale of fetal protection, appealing to that old left desire to stick up for the little guy. Current Issue View our current issue But the political battle lines around abortion would soon solidify, as the United States was plunged into a series of fiercely partisan battles over social issues during the Reagan era. People with liberal commitments found that they could no longer remain anti-choice; people with anti-choice commitments found that they could no longer remain liberal. Americans United for Life eventually fell into anti-feminist hands and became a rabidly right-wing group focused on ensuring Republican control of the judiciary. If the 1970s had opened with a still-lingering sense of uncertainty and discomfort among some liberals on the question of abortion, in the 1980s anti-choice conservatives began to draw the line: Even if liberals might have been sympathetic, this was now the right's cause. As the anti-choice movement veered more sharply to the right, it also became increasingly moralistic in its language and maximalist in its aims. In 1973, after the Roe decision, the National Right to Life Committee called for a constitutional amendment establishing fetal personhood. The proposition, which enjoyed support in Congress, would have criminalized abortion in all 50 states. But the pro-choice side, especially the large establishment-liberal groups like NARAL, were happy to fight on this territory. They depicted the proposed fetal-personhood amendment as not just extreme but anti-science, using Justice Harry A. Blackmun's opinion in Roe -which had gone long on medical technicalities and emphasized the rights of doctors, not women-to argue that the amendment substituted religion for medicine and backward superstition for forward-looking sophistication. This argument worked in part because, in the 1960s and early '70s, the pro-choice movement was populated less by activists than by doctors. In the early post- Roe years, the movement's main advocacy groups, such as NARAL, were associations of medical providers-respectable, educated, reformist, and largely male. The anti-choice side was no match for this bastion of credentialed professionalism, and the fetal-personhood amendment went nowhere. As a result of this early defeat, the anti-choice movement shifted to the strategy that it would continue to pursue into the 21st century: seeking not to ban abortion outright but instead to restrict it, making the procedure more and more expensive, humiliating, and onerous to get. The movement struck its first major blow in 1976 with the Hyde Amendment, a provision that banned the federal funding of abortion through Medicaid. The right to an abortion was thus immediately and drastically curtailed: Suddenly it was no longer an entitlement that every woman had, but rather an option that she could choose if she was able to pay for it. Meanwhile, the pro-choice movement was reinventing itself. What had long been associated with medical professionals was now increasingly dominated by feminists. These new pro-choice advocates saw themselves not as medical experts but as equal-rights activists. The feminist commitment to abortion rights emerged out of the women's liberation movement in the 1960s and '70s, in particular its anti-rape campaigns, which identified forced sex and forced pregnancy as two sides of the same coin. \"Tying Roe to liberty for women,\" Ziegler writes of the feminists who made abortion their cause in the late 1970s and early '80s, \"would legitimize the idea that women had the right to say no (or yes) to parenthood and pregnancy as well as to sex.\" As a result, the argument for choice was no longer just a matter of deference to medical practitioners' expertise and discretion, as Blackmun had outlined in Roe . Increasingly, abortion rights were about women's self-determination, their personal responsibility, and their individual freedom-those ideological buzzwords so often associated with the political right. T his role reversal, Ziegler observes, went both ways. The Roe decision marked the embrace by abortion rights activists of a rhetoric of independence and individual liberty that had long been advanced by the right. The ruling also upheld a vision of expansive federal power, including a judiciary that was able to undermine traditional social hierarchies such as gender with a stroke of its pen. Perhaps this is why the Roe decision inflamed so many on the right against the federal judiciary. Conservatives had already begun to target the courts in the wake of the major civil rights rulings of the 1950s and '60s. But after Roe , the judiciary took on a new importance in the conservative imagination, changing from an enemy to be hated into a tool worth capturing. Republican politicians spoke of the need to discipline the judiciary, to strip it of its jurisdiction over hot-button social issues; conservatives decried \"judicial activism\" and depicted federal judges as partisan hacks pursuing Democratic policy aims.

Conservatives had already begun to target the courts in the wake of the major civil rights rulings of the 1950s and '60s. But after Roe , the judiciary took on a new importance in the conservative imagination, changing from an enemy to be hated into a tool worth capturing. Republican politicians spoke of the need to discipline the judiciary, to strip it of its jurisdiction over hot-button social issues; conservatives decried \"judicial activism\" and depicted federal judges as partisan hacks pursuing Democratic policy aims. This conservative resentment toward the judiciary lasted longer than one might think; well into the 2000s, it was the right that decried judicial capture and the left that championed the independence of the courts. But when the right set out to take control of the federal courts, Roe -and the determination to overturn it-was the main reason why. In the first decades after Roe , anti-choice conservatives also went on the offensive in other ways that mimicked some of the left's traditional habits. The abortion rights movement was vulnerable, after all, on race. Pro-choice proponents had never fully reckoned with the history of their cause-especially the fact that in its early years, birth control and abortion rights activism had at times attracted an unsavory smattering of eugenicists, \"population control\" enthusiasts, racists, and busybody social reformers with a prurient interest in the sex lives of the poor, immigrants, and the mentally ill. The right pointed to this history and argued that abortion rights were racist by their very nature; a popular 1988 evangelical book, Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood , claimed that the organization had been founded as part of a conspiratorial effort by racists to destroy the Black community. Less quackish anti-choice arguments pointed to the higher rates of abortion among Black women and suggested that Black communities had been offered abortion rights in lieu of other, more substantial rights and social programs oriented toward achieving equality. The anti-choice conservatives who made these arguments were, of course, not interested in the realities of Black women's social position; they saw no contradiction in calling for Black women to be free while denying them the freedom to control their bodies, or in saying that Black women deserved social welfare services that would be \"better than abortion\" while at the same time forming alliances with those who wished to gut the welfare state. But there were members of the Black community who were skeptical of the abortion rights activists, believing they held too narrow an understanding of Black women's needs, and it created a tension in the movement that has still not been resolved. The anti-choice movement also began to use medical science for its own purposes-and then to distort it. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe but replaced the 1973 trimester framework with a more subjective and contingent standard, \"viability\"-that is, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. The court ruled that states could ban abortion outright after \"viability\" had been achieved. But \"viability\" proved to be a slippery standard-the science around it was and remains unsettled, including the measure of what is viable from one pregnancy to another. In response to this new ambiguity, the anti-choice movement set about searching for pretexts to claim that abortion harmed not only fetuses but also women themselves, and it looked for ways to attribute viability or other physical advancements to the fetus that it didn't have. If the pro-choice side, with its physician-led advocacy groups, had claimed the mantle of science in the 1970s, the anti-choice movement tried to snatch it away two decades later. But even when the science didn't conform to their worldview, anti-choice conservatives pressed on anyway. Soon, states would pass laws that required abortion providers to read a litany of medical lies to women before performing the procedure, including empirically untrue statements such as that abortion causes suicide or increases the risk of breast cancer. R eading Ziegler's descriptions of these abuses of fact, it's hard at times not to hear irritation slipping through her normally staid prose. But Ziegler is a historian, not a polemicist, and for the most part she treats her subjects with scrupulous neutrality. One knows where her sympathies lie, but she is careful not to intervene in the story. For a book about abortion, it's an uncommon choice. But the result is that even some of the most passionate and polarizing people in Roe -for example, the millennial abortion \"abolitionists\" who congregate in a Chick-fil-A in Longview, Tex., to proclaim their willingness to break clinic protection laws-can come off with the blandness of saltines. Ziegler aspires to a rigorous facticity, yet her prose can be so dryly factual that it is hard at times for the reader to grasp the moral emergency presented by those facts. Ziegler's approach, however, also has its virtues. In the abortion debate, anti-choice activists-and more than a few judges-have cast feminist abortion rights supporters as hysterical. By contrast, Ziegler's dispassionate recounting of the debate's major arguments is instructive, because her calm and orderly tone gradually makes clear how much it is that passion, not logic and science, has been driving the anti-choice movement. Even when anti-choice conservatives invoke noble values-racial justice, religious freedom-they never make a credible case that abortion bans actually serve them. In this way, Ziegler offers us a methodical and fair-minded chronicle. But what is most apparent from reading it is that the anti-choice movement won its long fight to overturn Roe not because its side was more persuasive but because it focused more on obtaining power. Anti-choice conservatives have marshaled a broad array of arguments against abortion's legality, but whether they involve freedom or the judiciary, work or medical technology, race or religion, none of them have been successful in gaining broad popular support. When the anti-choice movement has won important victories, it has done so not because it made the best arguments but because it has captured the courts. For the most part, despite failing to bring the majority of people to its side, the anti-choice movement has been successful because of the federal judges who agreed with it. Dobbs and its gruesome, tragic aftermath seems poised to further the trend: The American public is now more pro-choice than it's ever been, and the more that people see what it's like to live without Roe , the more they miss it. Yet will the popularity of abortion rights matter? Will the more successful arguments of the pro-choice side ultimately make a difference? While Ziegler's book frames itself as the history of a national obsession, it is also a book about power and the brute fact that whoever wields it determines our public policies-policies that often bear little relation to public opinion. While liberals and the left have sought to win people over to their side, Ziegler documents that the abortion fight, from Roe to Dobbs , is actually a story about state capture. And maybe this is the real lesson of her book, the one those of us who believe in abortion rights would do well to heed: that there is no argument, no angle, no story of suffering or indignity that will bring the constitutional right to abortion back. The task, then, is not to argue, but to organize.\n\nAs the anti-choice movement veered more sharply to the right, it also became increasingly moralistic in its language and maximalist in its aims. In 1973, after the Roe decision, the National Right to Life Committee called for a constitutional amendment establishing fetal personhood. The proposition, which enjoyed support in Congress, would have criminalized abortion in all 50 states. But the pro-choice side, especially the large establishment-liberal groups like NARAL, were happy to fight on this territory. They depicted the proposed fetal-personhood amendment as not just extreme but anti-science, using Justice Harry A. Blackmun's opinion in Roe -which had gone long on medical technicalities and emphasized the rights of doctors, not women-to argue that the amendment substituted religion for medicine and backward superstition for forward-looking sophistication. This argument worked in part because, in the 1960s and early '70s, the pro-choice movement was populated less by activists than by doctors. In the early post- Roe years, the movement's main advocacy groups, such as NARAL, were associations of medical providers-respectable, educated, reformist, and largely male. The anti-choice side was no match for this bastion of credentialed professionalism, and the fetal-personhood amendment went nowhere. As a result of this early defeat, the anti-choice movement shifted to the strategy that it would continue to pursue into the 21st century: seeking not to ban abortion outright but instead to restrict it, making the procedure more and more expensive, humiliating, and onerous to get. The movement struck its first major blow in 1976 with the Hyde Amendment, a provision that banned the federal funding of abortion through Medicaid. The right to an abortion was thus immediately and drastically curtailed: Suddenly it was no longer an entitlement that every woman had, but rather an option that she could choose if she was able to pay for it. Meanwhile, the pro-choice movement was reinventing itself. What had long been associated with medical professionals was now increasingly dominated by feminists. These new pro-choice advocates saw themselves not as medical experts but as equal-rights activists. The feminist commitment to abortion rights emerged out of the women's liberation movement in the 1960s and '70s, in particular its anti-rape campaigns, which identified forced sex and forced pregnancy as two sides of the same coin. \"Tying Roe to liberty for women,\" Ziegler writes of the feminists who made abortion their cause in the late 1970s and early '80s, \"would legitimize the idea that women had the right to say no (or yes) to parenthood and pregnancy as well as to sex.\" As a result, the argument for choice was no longer just a matter of deference to medical practitioners' expertise and discretion, as Blackmun had outlined in Roe . Increasingly, abortion rights were about women's self-determination, their personal responsibility, and their individual freedom-those ideological buzzwords so often associated with the political right. T his role reversal, Ziegler observes, went both ways. The Roe decision marked the embrace by abortion rights activists of a rhetoric of independence and individual liberty that had long been advanced by the right. The ruling also upheld a vision of expansive federal power, including a judiciary that was able to undermine traditional social hierarchies such as gender with a stroke of its pen. Perhaps this is why the Roe decision inflamed so many on the right against the federal judiciary. Conservatives had already begun to target the courts in the wake of the major civil rights rulings of the 1950s and '60s. But after Roe , the judiciary took on a new importance in the conservative imagination, changing from an enemy to be hated into a tool worth capturing.

But after Roe , the judiciary took on a new importance in the conservative imagination, changing from an enemy to be hated into a tool worth capturing. Republican politicians spoke of the need to discipline the judiciary, to strip it of its jurisdiction over hot-button social issues; conservatives decried \"judicial activism\" and depicted federal judges as partisan hacks pursuing Democratic policy aims. This conservative resentment toward the judiciary lasted longer than one might think; well into the 2000s, it was the right that decried judicial capture and the left that championed the independence of the courts. But when the right set out to take control of the federal courts, Roe -and the determination to overturn it-was the main reason why. In the first decades after Roe , anti-choice conservatives also went on the offensive in other ways that mimicked some of the left's traditional habits. The abortion rights movement was vulnerable, after all, on race. Pro-choice proponents had never fully reckoned with the history of their cause-especially the fact that in its early years, birth control and abortion rights activism had at times attracted an unsavory smattering of eugenicists, \"population control\" enthusiasts, racists, and busybody social reformers with a prurient interest in the sex lives of the poor, immigrants, and the mentally ill. The right pointed to this history and argued that abortion rights were racist by their very nature; a popular 1988 evangelical book, Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood , claimed that the organization had been founded as part of a conspiratorial effort by racists to destroy the Black community. Less quackish anti-choice arguments pointed to the higher rates of abortion among Black women and suggested that Black communities had been offered abortion rights in lieu of other, more substantial rights and social programs oriented toward achieving equality. The anti-choice conservatives who made these arguments were, of course, not interested in the realities of Black women's social position; they saw no contradiction in calling for Black women to be free while denying them the freedom to control their bodies, or in saying that Black women deserved social welfare services that would be \"better than abortion\" while at the same time forming alliances with those who wished to gut the welfare state. But there were members of the Black community who were skeptical of the abortion rights activists, believing they held too narrow an understanding of Black women's needs, and it created a tension in the movement that has still not been resolved. The anti-choice movement also began to use medical science for its own purposes-and then to distort it. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe but replaced the 1973 trimester framework with a more subjective and contingent standard, \"viability\"-that is, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. The court ruled that states could ban abortion outright after \"viability\" had been achieved. But \"viability\" proved to be a slippery standard-the science around it was and remains unsettled, including the measure of what is viable from one pregnancy to another. In response to this new ambiguity, the anti-choice movement set about searching for pretexts to claim that abortion harmed not only fetuses but also women themselves, and it looked for ways to attribute viability or other physical advancements to the fetus that it didn't have. If the pro-choice side, with its physician-led advocacy groups, had claimed the mantle of science in the 1970s, the anti-choice movement tried to snatch it away two decades later. But even when the science didn't conform to their worldview, anti-choice conservatives pressed on anyway. Soon, states would pass laws that required abortion providers to read a litany of medical lies to women before performing the procedure, including empirically untrue statements such as that abortion causes suicide or increases the risk of breast cancer. R eading Ziegler's descriptions of these abuses of fact, it's hard at times not to hear irritation slipping through her normally staid prose. But Ziegler is a historian, not a polemicist, and for the most part she treats her subjects with scrupulous neutrality. One knows where her sympathies lie, but she is careful not to intervene in the story. For a book about abortion, it's an uncommon choice. But the result is that even some of the most passionate and polarizing people in Roe -for example, the millennial abortion \"abolitionists\" who congregate in a Chick-fil-A in Longview, Tex., to proclaim their willingness to break clinic protection laws-can come off with the blandness of saltines. Ziegler aspires to a rigorous facticity, yet her prose can be so dryly factual that it is hard at times for the reader to grasp the moral emergency presented by those facts. Ziegler's approach, however, also has its virtues. In the abortion debate, anti-choice activists-and more than a few judges-have cast feminist abortion rights supporters as hysterical. By contrast, Ziegler's dispassionate recounting of the debate's major arguments is instructive, because her calm and orderly tone gradually makes clear how much it is that passion, not logic and science, has been driving the anti-choice movement. Even when anti-choice conservatives invoke noble values-racial justice, religious freedom-they never make a credible case that abortion bans actually serve them. In this way, Ziegler offers us a methodical and fair-minded chronicle. But what is most apparent from reading it is that the anti-choice movement won its long fight to overturn Roe not because its side was more persuasive but because it focused more on obtaining power. Anti-choice conservatives have marshaled a broad array of arguments against abortion's legality, but whether they involve freedom or the judiciary, work or medical technology, race or religion, none of them have been successful in gaining broad popular support. When the anti-choice movement has won important victories, it has done so not because it made the best arguments but because it has captured the courts. For the most part, despite failing to bring the majority of people to its side, the anti-choice movement has been successful because of the federal judges who agreed with it. Dobbs and its gruesome, tragic aftermath seems poised to further the trend: The American public is now more pro-choice than it's ever been, and the more that people see what it's like to live without Roe , the more they miss it. Yet will the popularity of abortion rights matter? Will the more successful arguments of the pro-choice side ultimately make a difference? While Ziegler's book frames itself as the history of a national obsession, it is also a book about power and the brute fact that whoever wields it determines our public policies-policies that often bear little relation to public opinion. While liberals and the left have sought to win people over to their side, Ziegler documents that the abortion fight, from Roe to Dobbs , is actually a story about state capture. And maybe this is the real lesson of her book, the one those of us who believe in abortion rights would do well to heed: that there is no argument, no angle, no story of suffering or indignity that will bring the constitutional right to abortion back.

And maybe this is the real lesson of her book, the one those of us who believe in abortion rights would do well to heed: that there is no argument, no angle, no story of suffering or indignity that will bring the constitutional right to abortion back. The task, then, is not to argue, but to organize.\n\nIn this way, Ziegler offers us a methodical and fair-minded chronicle. But what is most apparent from reading it is that the anti-choice movement won its long fight to overturn Roe not because its side was more persuasive but because it focused more on obtaining power. Anti-choice conservatives have marshaled a broad array of arguments against abortion's legality, but whether they involve freedom or the judiciary, work or medical technology, race or religion, none of them have been successful in gaining broad popular support. When the anti-choice movement has won important victories, it has done so not because it made the best arguments but because it has captured the courts. For the most part, despite failing to bring the majority of people to its side, the anti-choice movement has been successful because of the federal judges who agreed with it. Dobbs and its gruesome, tragic aftermath seems poised to further the trend: The American public is now more pro-choice than it's ever been, and the more that people see what it's like to live without Roe , the more they miss it. Yet will the popularity of abortion rights matter? Will the more successful arguments of the pro-choice side ultimately make a difference?

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Wade this month, we were inundated with calls to action from elected leaders saying that we need to \"restore Roe ,\" \"codify Roe ,\" and pass the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA). As someone who has worked in the reproductive rights and justice movements, I couldn't disagree more. Both Roe and WHPA are woefully insufficient solutions to the abortion access crisis that has been unfolding in slow motion for decades. We need bold solutions to achieve reproductive freedom-and we shouldn't settle for incremental progress when clearly that approach did not work and left the most marginalized to fend for themselves. Three years after the Roe ruling, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, a rider to the annual appropriations bill that bans abortion coverage for those with public insurance. Then-Representative Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) introduced the amendment with the explicit intent to prevent poor women from seeking abortion care. Today, the amendment is used to prevent anyone who receives health insurance through Medicaid, Medicare, Indian Health Service, or anyone in the Peace Corps, the military, or who works for the federal government, from using their insurance to pay for abortion care, except under limited circumstances. The Hyde Amendment isn't a law. It gets renewed every year, which means it can be removed at any time. Over the past decade, the calls for ending the Hyde Amendment have only become louder. Thanks to advocacy efforts led by All* Above All, which created the #BeBoldEndHyde campaign, abortion justice lawmakers have introduced the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH) Act in every session of Congress since 2015 . But it has yet to pass Congress. President Joe Biden went so far as to not include the Hyde Amendment in two of his budgets, but then caved each time. Related Article Conservatives Have a Sketchy New Legal Plot to Ban the Abortion Pill Elie Mystal There are some workarounds. Because Medicaid is a federal and state partnership, 16 states provide public funding of abortion care through their state Medicaid dollars. Illinois has taken the lead by increasing its Medicaid reimbursement rate by 20 percent, as providers see an increase in out-of-state patients since the Dobbs ruling. States can go a step further by enshrining the right to abortion in their Constitutions, removing gestational bans , and strengthening laws to protect individuals who self-manage their abortions from criminalization.

Centuries of racist economic and health care policies in the United States have led Black and Latine people to access their health insurance through Medicaid in significantly higher numbers than white or Asian people. Abortion restrictions are one reason some people have to access abortion care later in pregnancy or self-manage their abortion, which can often lead to criminalization. While only Nevada, South Carolina, and Oklahoma explicitly criminalize self-managed abortion, police and prosecutors in 26 states have distorted feticide laws passed after Roe became law-which were originally intended to protect pregnant people from domestic violence-to criminalize pregnant people for \"endangering\" their fetus. In one of the most egregious examples of pregnancy criminalization and exploitation of pregnant people, the district attorney of Etowah County, Ala., had a policy of holding pregnant and postpartum people accused of drug use in jail for weeks or months . The women had to pay a $10,000 cash bond and be released to an inpatient drug facility-although many of them were never assessed for a substance abuse disorder. When there was no availability at the rehab center, the women were forced to stay in jail while pregnant (and at least one woman wasn't even pregnant ). Current Issue View our current issue The Etowah County cases provide a damning preview of what's ahead in a post- Roe world if we continue on our current trajectory of denying bodily autonomy to over half the population. Surveillance and prosecution of pregnant people already occurred under Roe , but since the Supreme Court's conservative justices struck down that 1973 ruling, these extreme cases are becoming more mainstream. Restoring Roe won't prevent or stop the threat of criminalization and prosecution pregnant people face, particularly Black and brown folks. Codifying Roe won't give pregnant people control of their bodies and lives, when anti-abortion state officials have made it clear that they will stop at nothing when it comes to abortion, with or without Roe intact. We all deserve better than the return of a law that never worked for everyone. Abortion is a fundamental human right and access to it should not be dependent on \"a right to privacy\" but instead rooted in this nation's promise of equality and justice for all, which includes the right to self-determination and bodily autonomy. We must not stop fighting until we get that . Last fall, All* Above All released an Action Plan for Abortion Justice , a forward-thinking policy framework that calls for making abortion care affordable, accessible, and free of restrictions, regardless of a person's age, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status. (I worked on parts of the plan during my year at the organization.) People should not be forced to travel hundreds of miles to access abortion care. Those who manage to travel out of state are forced to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to do so. Grassroots organizations like local abortion funds and practical support funds, even with the immense increase in donations, still aren't able to fund every person who reaches out for help. This is a public health catastrophe that requires fierce action and a complete overhaul in the way we think and talk about abortion access and care in this country. Yet the same top Democrats who have talked a good game about restoring Roe continue to use our right to control our own bodies as a bargaining chip for other legislative endeavors that do not benefit the most marginalized in our communities. Earlier this month, the Democratic leader of the House-Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who spoke about the need for reproductive freedom in his first speech as party leader- joined a press conference where he publicly supported the appointment of an anti-abortion, anti-labor judge to be chief justice on New York state's highest court. Lest you think this was the first time a top Democrat stumped for an anti-abortion lawmaker, not long after the Dobbs decision leaked in May, Democratic leaders like Representative James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were campaigning on behalf of Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), an anti-abortion Democrat in the House of Representatives. Human rights are not negotiable. If our elected leaders aren't willing to unapologetically fight for our rights, we must elect new leaders. Until then, it's up to those of us with the resources-monetary and nonmonetary-to meet this moment and support our communities, because the right is not going to stop at abortion. Abortion bans, anti-trans legislation, and voting restrictions are not only inextricably linked together; they're backed by the same Christian Nationalist organizations . We won't be able to correct the decades of damage overnight, but we can create instead something much better that centers freedom and autonomy for all of us.\n\nAs someone who has worked in the reproductive rights and justice movements, I couldn't disagree more.

Lest you think this was the first time a top Democrat stumped for an anti-abortion lawmaker, not long after the Dobbs decision leaked in May, Democratic leaders like Representative James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were campaigning on behalf of Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), an anti-abortion Democrat in the House of Representatives. Human rights are not negotiable. If our elected leaders aren't willing to unapologetically fight for our rights, we must elect new leaders. Until then, it's up to those of us with the resources-monetary and nonmonetary-to meet this moment and support our communities, because the right is not going to stop at abortion. Abortion bans, anti-trans legislation, and voting restrictions are not only inextricably linked together; they're backed by the same Christian Nationalist organizations . We won't be able to correct the decades of damage overnight, but we can create instead something much better that centers freedom and autonomy for all of us.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nThere are some workarounds. Because Medicaid is a federal and state partnership, 16 states provide public funding of abortion care through their state Medicaid dollars. Illinois has taken the lead by increasing its Medicaid reimbursement rate by 20 percent, as providers see an increase in out-of-state patients since the Dobbs ruling. States can go a step further by enshrining the right to abortion in their Constitutions, removing gestational bans , and strengthening laws to protect individuals who self-manage their abortions from criminalization.

Centuries of racist economic and health care policies in the United States have led Black and Latine people to access their health insurance through Medicaid in significantly higher numbers than white or Asian people. Abortion restrictions are one reason some people have to access abortion care later in pregnancy or self-manage their abortion, which can often lead to criminalization. While only Nevada, South Carolina, and Oklahoma explicitly criminalize self-managed abortion, police and prosecutors in 26 states have distorted feticide laws passed after Roe became law-which were originally intended to protect pregnant people from domestic violence-to criminalize pregnant people for \"endangering\" their fetus. In one of the most egregious examples of pregnancy criminalization and exploitation of pregnant people, the district attorney of Etowah County, Ala., had a policy of holding pregnant and postpartum people accused of drug use in jail for weeks or months . The women had to pay a $10,000 cash bond and be released to an inpatient drug facility-although many of them were never assessed for a substance abuse disorder. When there was no availability at the rehab center, the women were forced to stay in jail while pregnant (and at least one woman wasn't even pregnant ). Current Issue View our current issue The Etowah County cases provide a damning preview of what's ahead in a post- Roe world if we continue on our current trajectory of denying bodily autonomy to over half the population. Surveillance and prosecution of pregnant people already occurred under Roe , but since the Supreme Court's conservative justices struck down that 1973 ruling, these extreme cases are becoming more mainstream. Restoring Roe won't prevent or stop the threat of criminalization and prosecution pregnant people face, particularly Black and brown folks. Codifying Roe won't give pregnant people control of their bodies and lives, when anti-abortion state officials have made it clear that they will stop at nothing when it comes to abortion, with or without Roe intact. We all deserve better than the return of a law that never worked for everyone. Abortion is a fundamental human right and access to it should not be dependent on \"a right to privacy\" but instead rooted in this nation's promise of equality and justice for all, which includes the right to self-determination and bodily autonomy. We must not stop fighting until we get that . Last fall, All* Above All released an Action Plan for Abortion Justice , a forward-thinking policy framework that calls for making abortion care affordable, accessible, and free of restrictions, regardless of a person's age, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status. (I worked on parts of the plan during my year at the organization.) People should not be forced to travel hundreds of miles to access abortion care. Those who manage to travel out of state are forced to pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to do so.

There's a German proverb that translates roughly as \"the soup is never eaten as hot as it's cooked,\" meaning things won't be as bad as you fear. Sometimes that's true, but it wasn't for the Germans, and it won't be for us. For years pro-choicers have warned that the right to abortion was at risk, only to be called Chicken Littles by pundits and politicos, usually men. Some thought returning abortion to the states would lead to a middle-of-the-road practical solution and, more important, take abortion out of politics. Ha! Others were sure no one wanted bans to happen: Republicans only used \"cultural issues\" to distract voters from the party's real agenda, screwing the working class on behalf of corporations. Thomas Frank made himself famous with a book devoted to that thesis, What's the Matter with Kansas? I hope he apologizes to the women of Kansas, because the fears he dismissed have come to pass. What can be done? Abortion funds, which raise money for low-income patients' procedures, are wonderful, and you should give them all your money now , but even before Dobbs , they couldn't help everyone in need. Their work will be harder now. On Monday, abortion funds in Texas suspended operations because of laws criminalizing helping women seeking to end their pregnancies. If you thought, as many did, that abortion opponents would be satisfied with a return to pre- Roe hypocrisies, when millions of women got abortions while law enforcement mostly looked the other way, think again. What about traveling to pro-choice states, some of which have recently strengthened protections for abortion rights? That's not so easy, even for people with money, although it will be much harder for low-income patients. Most women who have abortions are mothers, after all; many have jobs that won't allow them time off. They can't just pick up and fly to New York City or Chicago, or drive all day and night to reach the nearest clinic. They'll need help, and help is expensive. The Brigid Alliance , an abortion travel service which pays all costs-transportation, lodging, food, child care-spends about $1,000 per patient. The influx of patients from states with bans will affect care in the states they travel to. Clinics are already overscheduled. Soon they will be overwhelmed. Ah, but there are abortion pills, some say, which make it possible to end pregnancies cheaply at home. Pills are crucial, but not a panacea. Yes, they are safe, unlike illegal abortions pre- Roe , but you have to know they exist, how to find them, how to take them, and what to say if you end up going to the ER so you don't get arrested. You have to know how pregnant you are-they don't work so well after 12 weeks. You have to avoid copycat anti-abortion websites. And around 5 percent of the time, they won't work. Who knows how long it will be legal to send them, by mail or in person, to an abortion-ban state? Abortion opponents are already working on ways to criminalize pills and people who make it possible to acquire them. The latest: Facebook and Instagram are taking down information on how to obtain them. Remember when information wanted to be free?

In half the country, women are fetal vessels now. Their lives, their physical and mental health, their education, their employment, their relationships, their ability to care for their other children, their hopes, ambitions and dreams-none of that matters. What matters is that they incubate a fertilized egg and deliver an infant-which, as Amy Coney Barrett suggested, they can always drop off at the nearest safe-haven baby box. The law may not come after you if you give a pregnant friend money for the procedure or drive her to a free state; anti-abortion activists might not track your pregnancy digitally, as Jia Tolentino warns , but then again, they might (memo to readers: Delete your period tracker now ). The capacity exists: to know your online searches, your travel plans, your proximity to a clinic. Does a fetal vessel have rights? I wouldn't count on it. A nti-abortion politics have long relied on dividing women into good and bad, chaste and slutty. This was never true or just, but it allowed many women to think the right to abortion would never be something they needed. Soon it will be clear that even women with planned, welcome pregnancies will be affected by the loss of Roe . Where abortion is banned, pregnant women will be responsible for producing a live, healthy baby, and at risk of arrest and worse if they don't.

Refuse a Caesarean or a hospital delivery, reject doctor's order for bed rest, or tell your doctor you've used illegal drugs? As National Advocates for Pregnant Women has documented, over a thousand women in the past 20 years have already been charged, and sometimes convicted, for these and other behaviors during pregnancy, whether or not they resulted in harm to the fetus or born baby. Black, brown, and low-income women are more likely to be caught in the net, but why should it stop there? We are dealing with religious fanatics, with police chiefs on a mission and prosecutors looking to make their careers in deeply red places. Current Issue View our current issue For all women in abortion ban states, medical care will change. Some methods of birth control-the IUD, emergency contraception, maybe even the pill-may be outlawed as \"abortifacients,\" even though they do not in fact end pregnancies. It is not at all clear that doctors will always be able to terminate even the most dangerous pregnancies-an ectopic pregnancy, for example, which can never result in a live birth but can be fatal, or a miscarriage in progress even of fetuses with no chance of survival. Doctors are conservative and cautious by training and status; women undergoing miscarriages have already been denied care in Texas. In Poland, where abortion is now almost completely banned , two women recently died of sepsis because doctors refused to give them abortions, in one case for a miscarriage in progress , in another for a dead fetus in a twin pregnancy . In Malta, just last week, a pregnant American tourist had to be airlifted to Spain in the middle of her miscarriage, because Malta has a complete ban on abortion . (My dear friend Frances Kissling, longtime head of Catholics for Choice, says Catholic teaching permits doctors to end a pregnancy under these circumstances, but apparently not everyone has gotten the message .) And what about men? Abortion bans give any fertile man the power to permanently derail or even end a girl or woman's life. He could be a rapist, a husband, a one-night stand, a teenage boyfriend who promises to pull out but doesn't succeed. The cost to him will be little or nothing-it's not very likely that the gun-happy Supreme Court will declare the penis a dangerous weapon. The inseminator can even sue, and maybe obtain custody and child support from his victim. Just the other week in Louisiana, a man won custody of his teenage daughter by the woman he had raped years ago, when she was only 15. (That judgment has since been reversed, after a huge media uproar.) It staggers the mind that the court is so oblivious to the hard realities of women's lives. But it shouldn't. After all, when has the patriarchal Christianity to which all six of the anti-choice justices subscribe cared about women and their struggles to make a decent life with so much stacked against them economically, socially, and culturally? When has the Catholic Church cared about the effort required of women to manage their fertility for 30-40 years? When has fundamentalist Protestantism said women should not be ruled by men? Back in 1991, then-federal appeals court judge Samuel Alito supported requiring women to notify their husbands before having an abortion, despite much testimony about the harm this would do to women in troubled marriages. Fast forward, and Alito, author of the Dobbs decision, cites 13th-century case law and the legal writings of 17th-century jurist Matthew Hale, who defended marital rape and sent two women to execution as witches. It's not easy to wrap one's head around a paradigm shift. After Kavanaugh was confirmed, even after Amy Coney effing Barret was confirmed, even after the leak of Alito's draft decision in Dobbs , pundits and reporters spent a lot of energy trying to make the anti-abortion six look more moderate than they are, more concerned with procedure and precedent, more cautious, more interested in incremental rather than sweeping change. I myself wrote more than once that if the court were smart it would keep Roe , while gutting its effectiveness, rather than trigger a political nightmare for the Republican Party. But that was an if, not a when. I guess Mr. Dooley was wrong when he said that the Supreme Court follows the election returns. Sometimes doing the bidding of GOP Jesus is more important.\n\nFor years pro-choicers have warned that the right to abortion was at risk, only to be called Chicken Littles by pundits and politicos, usually men. Some thought returning abortion to the states would lead to a middle-of-the-road practical solution and, more important, take abortion out of politics. Ha! Others were sure no one wanted bans to happen: Republicans only used \"cultural issues\" to distract voters from the party's real agenda, screwing the working class on behalf of corporations. Thomas Frank made himself famous with a book devoted to that thesis, What's the Matter with Kansas? I hope he apologizes to the women of Kansas, because the fears he dismissed have come to pass. What can be done? Abortion funds, which raise money for low-income patients' procedures, are wonderful, and you should give them all your money now , but even before Dobbs , they couldn't help everyone in need. Their work will be harder now. On Monday, abortion funds in Texas suspended operations because of laws criminalizing helping women seeking to end their pregnancies. If you thought, as many did, that abortion opponents would be satisfied with a return to pre- Roe hypocrisies, when millions of women got abortions while law enforcement mostly looked the other way, think again. What about traveling to pro-choice states, some of which have recently strengthened protections for abortion rights? That's not so easy, even for people with money, although it will be much harder for low-income patients. Most women who have abortions are mothers, after all; many have jobs that won't allow them time off. They can't just pick up and fly to New York City or Chicago, or drive all day and night to reach the nearest clinic. They'll need help, and help is expensive. The Brigid Alliance , an abortion travel service which pays all costs-transportation, lodging, food, child care-spends about $1,000 per patient. The influx of patients from states with bans will affect care in the states they travel to. Clinics are already overscheduled. Soon they will be overwhelmed. Ah, but there are abortion pills, some say, which make it possible to end pregnancies cheaply at home. Pills are crucial, but not a panacea. Yes, they are safe, unlike illegal abortions pre- Roe , but you have to know they exist, how to find them, how to take them, and what to say if you end up going to the ER so you don't get arrested. You have to know how pregnant you are-they don't work so well after 12 weeks. You have to avoid copycat anti-abortion websites. And around 5 percent of the time, they won't work. Who knows how long it will be legal to send them, by mail or in person, to an abortion-ban state? Abortion opponents are already working on ways to criminalize pills and people who make it possible to acquire them.

Current Issue View our current issue For all women in abortion ban states, medical care will change. Some methods of birth control-the IUD, emergency contraception, maybe even the pill-may be outlawed as \"abortifacients,\" even though they do not in fact end pregnancies. It is not at all clear that doctors will always be able to terminate even the most dangerous pregnancies-an ectopic pregnancy, for example, which can never result in a live birth but can be fatal, or a miscarriage in progress even of fetuses with no chance of survival. Doctors are conservative and cautious by training and status; women undergoing miscarriages have already been denied care in Texas. In Poland, where abortion is now almost completely banned , two women recently died of sepsis because doctors refused to give them abortions, in one case for a miscarriage in progress , in another for a dead fetus in a twin pregnancy . In Malta, just last week, a pregnant American tourist had to be airlifted to Spain in the middle of her miscarriage, because Malta has a complete ban on abortion .

And what about men? Abortion bans give any fertile man the power to permanently derail or even end a girl or woman's life. He could be a rapist, a husband, a one-night stand, a teenage boyfriend who promises to pull out but doesn't succeed. The cost to him will be little or nothing-it's not very likely that the gun-happy Supreme Court will declare the penis a dangerous weapon. The inseminator can even sue, and maybe obtain custody and child support from his victim.

In half the country, women are fetal vessels now. Their lives, their physical and mental health, their education, their employment, their relationships, their ability to care for their other children, their hopes, ambitions and dreams-none of that matters. What matters is that they incubate a fertilized egg and deliver an infant-which, as Amy Coney Barrett suggested, they can always drop off at the nearest safe-haven baby box.

Activate your online access\n\nA conversation with journalist Amanda Becker about her new book, You Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America .\n\nAmanda Becker is no stranger to tackling tough topics head-on. The Washington correspondent for the nonprofit news organization The 19th , Amanda has spent over a decade covering Congress, the White House, and elections, having previously worked at Reuters and CQ Roll Call. Amanda is also an Ohio native and brings a personal connection to the challenges faced in her home state, particularly the restrictive abortion laws that have long shaped the lives of many.\n\nHer latest book, You Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America , was born out of what she describes as a moment of \"seismic change\" following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . While on a family trip in Florida, Becker learned through the draft leak that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade , and she immediately understood that her book would be \"the most important story\" she would ever cover.\n\nIn You Must Stand Up , Becker follows grassroots leaders, healthcare providers, and activists as they navigate the chaotic aftermath of the ruling. Becker also acknowledges the complexities of reporting on abortion at this moment when, as one clinic worker pointed out, \"the world is gawking at our trauma.\" Real people are impacted by these legislative and judicial decisions, and Becker doesn't shy away from the complicated realities that we are all living in. At the same time, Becker offers a powerful portrait of resilience and hope in the fight for abortion rights and access for everyone.\n\nI spoke with Amanda about her process and the challenges that came with documenting the first year after Dobbs , a time when it seemed as if everything was in flux, and about the remarkable ways providers, activists, and everyday people have navigated and resisted the attacks on abortion access. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\n-Larada Lee-Wallace\n\nLLW: The Dobbs decision has had a profound impact on abortion access across the country. How did you choose what subjects to focus on in your book, and what were the most striking differences you observed in how different regions responded to the decision?\n\nAB: I chose to focus on the first year without federal abortion rights to capture a snapshot of what it meant to live in a post- Dobbs world. I wanted to illuminate the different realities Americans face under new abortion restrictions and highlight the varied responses across regions.\n\nTuscaloosa, Alabama, was a primary focus because Robin Marty-executive director of the West Alabama Women's Center-was a key figure in providing insight into the challenges of a state with strict abortion bans.\n\nRobin's connections led me to Dr. Gabrielle Goodrick, who founded the Camelback Family Planning Center in Phoenix, Arizona, which offered a contrasting perspective from the western United States.\n\nI also included tertiary settings like Ohio, where I have personal ties, to explore its direct ballot initiative aimed at protecting abortion rights, while Wisconsin illustrates how democratic responses are unfolding in the face of restrictive laws.\n\nOverall, I selected these locations to highlight not only the varied regional responses but also to address the broader theme of democratic erosion and the disconnect between laws and public opinion.\n\nLLW: \"Creative resistance\" is a key theme in your book. Can you share some examples of the innovative strategies that activists, healthcare providers, or legal teams used to navigate the new post- Dobbs landscape?\n\nAB: I think Dr. Gabrielle Goodrick is a prime example of creative resistance. As an abortion provider, her expertise lies in medicine, not legal strategy. Yet, she has adeptly navigated the post- Dobbs landscape by using her medical knowledge to circumvent restrictive laws.\n\nArizona law currently restricts most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with few exceptions, and imposes strict regulations on providers, making access more challenging. The situation worsened when a pre-statehood law kicked in that was a near-total ban on abortion. Although the 15-week ban was later reinstated, the legal uncertainty created confusion and it was difficult for Dr. Goodrick or other providers to know on a day-to-day basis which law was in place and how they were able to treat patients.\n\nDr. Goodrick explores how to provide the same standard of care within the confines of new regulations and the title of the book is from a blog post she wrote that called on doctors to protect their profession.\n\nIn addition to providers like Dr. Goodrick, the book highlights various ways in which people figured out their role to play in our democracy to protect abortion rights. For instance, medical students have had to adapt to new challenges, such as limited access to OB-GYN education in certain areas. Everyday voters also play a crucial role, as shown in the chapter set in Kentucky, which underscores the importance of active engagement to ensure voters, who overwhelmingly support abortion access, have a voice in shaping policies.\n\nThese examples collectively demonstrate that when faced with significant challenges, individuals and groups can find innovative ways to contribute to causes they care about, they just have to figure out what their specific role is based on their strengths and expertise.\n\nLLW: What were some of the challenges you faced in documenting the first year after Roe was overturned, given that it was such a rapidly evolving situation? How did you ensure your reporting remained accurate and up-to-date?\n\nAB: I was actually doing the Nieman Fellowship at Harvard during much of this first year after Dobbs , and it was not a book fellowship. I was trying to balance what my responsibilities for the fellowship were and what I was looking forward to-having a break from the newsroom as I was doing this fantastic fellowship.\n\nThe nature of book writing offers both luxuries and challenges compared to daily journalism. While I had the time to reflect and revise, this also meant that my work was often subject to change long after it was written. To address this, I focused on capturing the accuracy of events as they unfolded in real-time, knowing that updates might be needed.\n\nA prime example is Arizona, where legal confusion and shifting regulations created a chaotic environment. The state's situation was in constant flux, with even Republican officials struggling to agree on which laws were in effect. I was aware that some details might become outdated quickly, but documenting this ongoing uncertainty was crucial to illustrating the confusion and distress experienced by abortion providers and other stakeholders in those early months.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nLLW: What do you hope readers take away from these stories, and what they tell us about the post- Dobbs landscape?\n\nAB: I hope readers gain a deeper understanding of what I like to refer to as the \"connective tissues\" of our democracy. The US democratic system is incredibly complex, with numerous forces at play, including those who profit from understanding and exploiting its intricacies. I want readers to grasp how our democracy functions on a granular level, which will hopefully empower them to participate more fully and confidently in the democratic process.\n\nThe post- Dobbs landscape has created vastly different realities for Americans depending on where they live, illuminating the erosion of democratic norms and equal rights across the country. But if abortion rights are issue someone cares about, there is a role for everyone to play, and the book is showing people who have figured out what their specific role is based on their own experience and expertise.\n\nAnother key takeaway I hope to impart is the importance of active participation in democracy. It's not about passively waiting for change to happen. Democracy offers direct avenues for engagement, such as ballot initiatives , and we elect representatives to serve our interests. When they fail to do so, it's crucial for us to remember that we have the power to hold them accountable and, if necessary, replace them. People need to take this responsibility seriously if they believe their elected officials are not representing their interests. My hope is that these stories I tell can be used as a manual for how people can participate in US democracy.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Blaming ourselves: Isn't that what we progressives, especially women, love to do? Somehow, it's our fault-for being too white/middle-class/respectable, too beholden to the Democratic Party in return for too few crumbs. Always throwing money at unwinnable races, allowing abortion to be stigmatized (\"safe, legal, and rare\"), maintaining bloated organizations that lumber and creak and resist change. It's all true-I've written that piece many times. But today I'm not so sure any of that would have mattered. The truth is, Donald Trump came to power despite losing the popular vote by almost 3 million, enabling Mitch McConnell to ruthlessly engineer the current right-wing Catholic anti-abortion Supreme Court majority, and here we are. The crisis of abortion is a crisis of democracy. Whoever is in Alito's majority, none of them care about public opinion, which is majority pro- Roe . Nor, apparently, do they seriously consider the many terrible consequences of forcing so many women into unwanted childbirth. (They can always give the baby away, as Amy Coney Barrett suggested helpfully .) They're in their own theocratic bubble, where anything goes if it supports the holy cause-where, for example, Alito can approvingly cite Matthew Hale , a 17th-century British jurist who sentenced two women to execution as witches and wrote an influential treatise permitting men to rape their wives. Superstitious? Misogynistic? They just don't care. In the face of this disaster, it's tempting to rant and rave. There's been a lot of that, in print and online, and that's fine. We need passion, articulate and splendid passion, to spur us to the work ahead. But this time I'm going to leave the rage and fire to others-take it away, Rebecca Traister! Instead, I want to think out loud here about what that work might be. First, we need to bolster abortion rights and access wherever possible, and that means winning elections wherever possible. Frances Kissling , the former president of Catholics for Choice, tells me that the pro-choice movement has little to show for its electoral efforts in red states (remember the massive shower of gold for Wendy Davis?) and should shift its focus to shoring up blue states and providing actual services, such as organizing travel from abortion-ban states. I'm with her on strengthening blue states, but I don't agree about abandoning the red ones. Taking back state legislatures and governorships will be the work of many years-and we can probably be smarter about choosing our battles-but whittling away at anti-choice majorities in the red states has to be on our to-do list, or our problems will only grow worse. Kissling is certainly right, though, that there's work to be done in Blue America. Currently, 16 states , as well as the District of Columbia, have enshrined legal abortion in their constitutions or statutes; we need all blue and purple states to do so, because the forces that came for abortion in the red states will come hard at them now. My part-time home state of Connecticut is a shining star here. This month it passed not only state constitutional protection of abortion, but laws protecting providers, abortion travelers, and those who help them from the legal reach of abortion-ban states. Connecticut now explicitly codifies the right of some non-MD medical workers to perform some abortions and give out abortion pills.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins Second, Kissling argues, we need to energize (polite word) the whole medical profession and hold it to account. Many medical schools don't teach the procedure. We need to force them to do so as part of routine gynecological care, because that is what it is. And what about hospitals? The economics of running a stand-alone clinic can be pretty daunting, especially given low reimbursement rates from Medicaid. That is one reason clinics have been closing, even in blue states. Hospitals could take on some of this work, but few do: In 2017, they performed only 3 percent of abortions , and that includes secular, non-Catholic hospitals. Why? Maybe a big donor is anti-choice. Maybe management fears being targeted by anti-abortion activists. There's not a lot of money in an uncomplicated first-trimester abortion, and potentially a lot of tsuris. Tough. We need to pressure hospitals to rise to the challenge and give women an uncomplicated, legal service that one in four of them will need during their fertile years. Indeed, not to do so is a kind of malpractice akin to refusing to treat someone for a widespread, easily cured, but potentially fatal condition because it's just too much of a bother. Third, we need to push the blue states to fund abortion directly: to subsidize clinic and hospital services, raise Medicaid reimbursements, expand Medicaid to include undocumented immigrants, and make grants to abortion funds that help low-income people pay for their procedures. (The New York City Council has led the way here: Since 2019, it has granted $250,000 annually to the New York Abortion Access Fund.) What about blue states setting up bus services to bring red-state patients to clinics? Paying for hotel stays for abortion travelers? Current Issue View our current issue Fourth: Donors-i.e., you-need to step up your giving. There are already way too many women who have to travel for their procedures. That is going to be magnified many times over in the 26 states poised to ban or greatly restrict abortion once Roe is overturned-and those women will be traveling farther as neighboring states pass bans of their own. Now is the time to give generously to travel funds like the Brigid Alliance, which covers the cost of transportation, plus food, lodging, child care-whatever the patient needs. Give to regular funds as well-the more money they have, the more they can fund first-trimester procedures before patients reach the far more expensive second trimester. The National Network of Abortion Funds is holding its annual fundraiser right now ( fundathon.nnaf.org) . On its home page, you'll find a map of all its member funds, probably including one or more in your region. And don't forget: Right now, abortion is legal in every state. Fifth: Use your imagination. Can you host a traveling patient in your spare room, or even on your sofa? If you run an Airbnb, can you volunteer it one or two days a month? Can you drive someone from a banned state to the nearest clinic? Volunteer as a clinic escort? Mind a patient's children while she's having her procedure? Call your local clinic and ask how you can help. Pro tip: If you are feeling short of money to donate, look over your credit card bills. Believe it or not, there are women who are prevented from ending their pregnancy because they can't pay for a babysitter or a bus ride. Fifty dollars could make all the difference. The fees for that streaming service you never use (ahem!) and that Substack you haven't looked at in months could be transformed into a monthly donation to the Frontera Fund , which helps low-income residents of the Rio Grande Valley access abortion, or Just the Pill , which sends affordable abortion pills by mail and is starting a mobile clinic. Sixth: Do more. If you are reading this, chances are you are already voting, donating, writing your legislators, and so on, like the good citizen you are. So, go further: Demonstrate incessantly, like the feminists of Argentina and Mexico. Walk out of that anti-choice church you still go to for some reason, like Polish feminists did in 2016 when the government threatened to ban abortion. Put up informative stickers, as Irish pro-choicers did back when it was against the law even to give out the phone numbers of UK clinics. Stand with your friends outside your local crisis pregnancy center, aka fake abortion clinic, and politely hand out leaflets telling people what the place really does. Remember, though: It's not the 1960s. For every kind of activism you want to get involved in, there are groups working on it already. You don't need to start your own secret network to get pregnant women out of Texas-give to Fund Texas Choice , which already does that. Nor need you personally smuggle abortion pills into states with bans. Even in Texas, people can order pills online and, if necessary, have them mailed to a forwarding address in another state. Thousands of women have already gotten pills this way. What would be helpful? Smith College professor Carrie N. Baker, who studies the abortion pill, suggests you spread information about abortion pills and how to get them safely. Go to plancpills.org for details. Finally, don't let yourself feel pre-defeated. We can win this eventually, but despair will make it harder. Just concentrate on what you can do now: protecting and expanding rights where possible, supporting abortion services, and, above all, getting pro-choice legislators into office at every level. The progressive activist Heather Booth, a founder of the Jane Collective, which provided clandestine abortions in Chicago pre- Roe , told me, \"I took two big lessons from the civil rights movement, which also seemed an impossible struggle. One is, sometimes you have to stand up to illegitimate authority. The other is, if we organize, we can win. Even in the face of bad decisions and conflict and trouble, we still need to be agents of hope.\"\n\nWhoever is in Alito's majority, none of them care about public opinion, which is majority pro- Roe .

Frances Kissling , the former president of Catholics for Choice, tells me that the pro-choice movement has little to show for its electoral efforts in red states (remember the massive shower of gold for Wendy Davis?) and should shift its focus to shoring up blue states and providing actual services, such as organizing travel from abortion-ban states. I'm with her on strengthening blue states, but I don't agree about abandoning the red ones. Taking back state legislatures and governorships will be the work of many years-and we can probably be smarter about choosing our battles-but whittling away at anti-choice majorities in the red states has to be on our to-do list, or our problems will only grow worse. Kissling is certainly right, though, that there's work to be done in Blue America. Currently, 16 states , as well as the District of Columbia, have enshrined legal abortion in their constitutions or statutes; we need all blue and purple states to do so, because the forces that came for abortion in the red states will come hard at them now. My part-time home state of Connecticut is a shining star here. This month it passed not only state constitutional protection of abortion, but laws protecting providers, abortion travelers, and those who help them from the legal reach of abortion-ban states. Connecticut now explicitly codifies the right of some non-MD medical workers to perform some abortions and give out abortion pills.

Many medical schools don't teach the procedure. We need to force them to do so as part of routine gynecological care, because that is what it is. And what about hospitals? The economics of running a stand-alone clinic can be pretty daunting, especially given low reimbursement rates from Medicaid. That is one reason clinics have been closing, even in blue states. Hospitals could take on some of this work, but few do: In 2017, they performed only 3 percent of abortions , and that includes secular, non-Catholic hospitals. Why? Maybe a big donor is anti-choice. Maybe management fears being targeted by anti-abortion activists. There's not a lot of money in an uncomplicated first-trimester abortion, and potentially a lot of tsuris. Tough. We need to pressure hospitals to rise to the challenge and give women an uncomplicated, legal service that one in four of them will need during their fertile years. Indeed, not to do so is a kind of malpractice akin to refusing to treat someone for a widespread, easily cured, but potentially fatal condition because it's just too much of a bother. Third, we need to push the blue states to fund abortion directly: to subsidize clinic and hospital services, raise Medicaid reimbursements, expand Medicaid to include undocumented immigrants, and make grants to abortion funds that help low-income people pay for their procedures. (The New York City Council has led the way here: Since 2019, it has granted $250,000 annually to the New York Abortion Access Fund.) What about blue states setting up bus services to bring red-state patients to clinics? Paying for hotel stays for abortion travelers? Current Issue View our current issue Fourth: Donors-i.e., you-need to step up your giving. There are already way too many women who have to travel for their procedures. That is going to be magnified many times over in the 26 states poised to ban or greatly restrict abortion once Roe is overturned-and those women will be traveling farther as neighboring states pass bans of their own. Now is the time to give generously to travel funds like the Brigid Alliance, which covers the cost of transportation, plus food, lodging, child care-whatever the patient needs. Give to regular funds as well-the more money they have, the more they can fund first-trimester procedures before patients reach the far more expensive second trimester. The National Network of Abortion Funds is holding its annual fundraiser right now ( fundathon.nnaf.org) . On its home page, you'll find a map of all its member funds, probably including one or more in your region. And don't forget: Right now, abortion is legal in every state. Fifth: Use your imagination. Can you host a traveling patient in your spare room, or even on your sofa? If you run an Airbnb, can you volunteer it one or two days a month? Can you drive someone from a banned state to the nearest clinic? Volunteer as a clinic escort? Mind a patient's children while she's having her procedure? Call your local clinic and ask how you can help. Pro tip: If you are feeling short of money to donate, look over your credit card bills. Believe it or not, there are women who are prevented from ending their pregnancy because they can't pay for a babysitter or a bus ride. Fifty dollars could make all the difference. The fees for that streaming service you never use (ahem!) and that Substack you haven't looked at in months could be transformed into a monthly donation to the Frontera Fund , which helps low-income residents of the Rio Grande Valley access abortion, or Just the Pill , which sends affordable abortion pills by mail and is starting a mobile clinic. Sixth: Do more. If you are reading this, chances are you are already voting, donating, writing your legislators, and so on, like the good citizen you are. So, go further: Demonstrate incessantly, like the feminists of Argentina and Mexico. Walk out of that anti-choice church you still go to for some reason, like Polish feminists did in 2016 when the government threatened to ban abortion. Put up informative stickers, as Irish pro-choicers did back when it was against the law even to give out the phone numbers of UK clinics. Stand with your friends outside your local crisis pregnancy center, aka fake abortion clinic, and politely hand out leaflets telling people what the place really does. Remember, though: It's not the 1960s. For every kind of activism you want to get involved in, there are groups working on it already. You don't need to start your own secret network to get pregnant women out of Texas-give to Fund Texas Choice , which already does that. Nor need you personally smuggle abortion pills into states with bans. Even in Texas, people can order pills online and, if necessary, have them mailed to a forwarding address in another state. Thousands of women have already gotten pills this way. What would be helpful? Smith College professor Carrie N. Baker, who studies the abortion pill, suggests you spread information about abortion pills and how to get them safely. Go to plancpills.org for details. Finally, don't let yourself feel pre-defeated. We can win this eventually, but despair will make it harder. Just concentrate on what you can do now: protecting and expanding rights where possible, supporting abortion services, and, above all, getting pro-choice legislators into office at every level. The progressive activist Heather Booth, a founder of the Jane Collective, which provided clandestine abortions in Chicago pre- Roe , told me, \"I took two big lessons from the civil rights movement, which also seemed an impossible struggle. One is, sometimes you have to stand up to illegitimate authority. The other is, if we organize, we can win.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But nothing could fully brace us for the pain of reading Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion, which categorically declared that abortion is not a constitutional right. While we took to the streets to rage and mourn the destruction of our rights, we heard from feminist allies and partners around the world-some of whom had successfully fought deeply entrenched patriarchal forces to secure historic advances for abortion rights in their country and offered lessons for our struggle. There is an immense amount to learn from them, but there is one lesson in particular to embrace: We must place human rights at the center of our demands for unfettered access to abortion. Since the Supreme Court decided Roe in 1973, the story of abortion access in the United States has been one of steady regression. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment to restrict the use of federal funds for abortion except in limited circumstances. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in Harris v. McRae , which found that that neither the federal government nor states were required to pay for abortion services-severely undercutting the realization of a constitutional right. Subsequent years saw Planned Parenthood v. Casey limit Roe through the imposition of the \"undue burden\" standard, Gonzales v. Carhart limit later abortions, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra limit regulation of anti-abortion \"crisis pregnancy centers.\" And just under 50 years after Roe , the court dealt its killing blow to abortion rights in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . Meanwhile, the international human rights system was on the opposite trajectory. The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of multiple human rights treaties-the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights , and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ; the Convention against Torture ; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ; and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination . Over the past 50 years, these treaties (and others) have confirmed that reproductive autonomy is essential to achieving equality, and have been used to vindicate rights guaranteed for pregnant people the world over-from Peru to Ireland to Poland .

Reproductive justice advocates, long aware of the limits of domestic legal and political frameworks and strategies, have already played a crucial role in reframing reproductive rights as human rights. They have argued time and again that Roe was the floor, not the ceiling, and the future needs to look beyond its codification. The recently released guidelines on abortion from the World Health Organization (WHO) provide an important blueprint for the way forward. Taking an approach that melds health and human rights, the guidelines recommend that countries fully decriminalize abortion , have abortion be available on request , and do not regulate abortion based on the circumstances of the condition (for example only allowing access in cases of rape) nor based on gestational limits . This expansive foundation for abortion rights stands in stark contrast to the legal basis for Roe , whose constitutional privacy frame and somewhat arbitrary line of \"viability\" proved to be extremely vulnerable to attack. To use a cliche, the human rights approach is how we \" build back better .\" Related Article Biden's Troubling Response to \"Dobbs\" Andrea Grimes and The Nation This will require a fundamental shift in how US government officials and elites in domestic and foreign policy spaces view human rights. The United States often positions them as an international policy, not a vision for its own governing bodies to pursue. As a result, it's not a surprise that the United States has ratified relatively few international human rights treaties, despite having played a leading role in the development and negotiation of many of these frameworks. For example, the US is one of only six countries in the world who has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Its bedfellows here are countries with abysmal records on women's rights, including Sudan, Somalia, and Iran. Not only does this undermine the US's self-asserted leadership on human rights, it also deprives people in the US of valuable protections. So where to from here? Current Issue View our current issue Beyond demanding the United States ratify all global human rights treaties with the intention to meaningfully implement them domestically, including CEDAW , Americans and the international community can insist that the country answer for its violations of three other relevant treaties -the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Convention against Torture. Each of these treaties have been ratified by the US and protect abortion access as a matter of the rights to the pregnant person's life, health, non-discrimination (on the grounds of gender, race and socioeconomic status), privacy, and freedom from torture, cruel, and degrading treatment. Importantly, these rights (and others) only apply at birth . Abortion regulations permitted under Dobbs are an infringement on these rights. These issues are likely to draw significant attention in mid-August when the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination will scrutinize the United States' record on various issues related to racial discrimination-including voting rights, mass incarceration, and police violence. The committee has also asked the US to report on its \"[e]fforts to address restrictive legislation in the field of sexual and reproductive health and their disproportionate impact on women belonging to racial and ethnic minorities, including with regard to voluntary termination of pregnancy,\" thanks to the leadership of US-based human rights organizations, including my own , which have pushed for a review of the United States' abortion policies. These structural barriers to sexual and reproductive health care cannot be separated from other systems of oppression in the United States, including voter disenfranchisement, police brutality, and the carceral state-all of which the right has prioritized in its concerted attacks on democracy. Related Article Gleaning Hope From Latin America's Abortion Rights Revolution Omar G. Encarnación The Human Rights Committee, which monitors the ICCPR, and the Committee Against Torture (CAT), which monitors observance of the Convention against Torture, are also set to review the United States in the next two years. The ICCPR requires countries \"to not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers that deny effective access by women and girls to safe and legal abortion.\" The committee has found denial of abortion to violate a range of rights under the ICCPR. For example, in a pair of cases decided by the committee related to Ireland's total abortion ban in 2016 and 2017, they found that forcing women to travel to access safe abortion services in certain circumstances resulted in \"intense physical and mental suffering,\" in violation of the treaty's prohibition on cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The committee ordered Ireland to provide compensation and other measures of remedy to the affected women, and called on the country to reform its abortion laws. Peru has similarly provided compensation to a girl who was denied access to abortion as a result of the committee's decision. The Committee Against Torture has also found total abortion bans to constitute a violation of its provisions. The international community has already responded with outrage to the Dobbs ruling and how devastating it will be for pregnant people in the United States. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called the decision \"a huge blow to women's human rights and gender equality.\" The ruling has also drawn criticism from the WHO and human rights experts , as well as the leaders of allied countries, including France , Canada , and Belgium . French political leaders have announced that they are seeking to amend their Constitution to explicitly protect abortion to better cement protections, saying, \"What happened elsewhere must not happen in France.\" To be sure, an international human rights strategy is just one part of a multifaceted approach that needs to be taken in the United States to build back the framework of reproductive rights in this country-and one that is far stronger than the frame overturned by Dobbs . But as we watch the decimation of rights and confront the limits of a 200+ year-old constitutional framework, it is imperative that Democratic leaders and activists look outward, with humility, and learn from the countries expanding rights , not restricting them. And it is far past time that the United States subjected itself to a human rights framework that it helped to build for others but has zealously withheld from its own people.\n\nSince the Supreme Court decided Roe in 1973, the story of abortion access in the United States has been one of steady regression.

These structural barriers to sexual and reproductive health care cannot be separated from other systems of oppression in the United States, including voter disenfranchisement, police brutality, and the carceral state-all of which the right has prioritized in its concerted attacks on democracy.

The ICCPR requires countries \"to not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers that deny effective access by women and girls to safe and legal abortion.\" The committee has found denial of abortion to violate a range of rights under the ICCPR. For example, in a pair of cases decided by the committee related to Ireland's total abortion ban in 2016 and 2017, they found that forcing women to travel to access safe abortion services in certain circumstances resulted in \"intense physical and mental suffering,\" in violation of the treaty's prohibition on cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The committee ordered Ireland to provide compensation and other measures of remedy to the affected women, and called on the country to reform its abortion laws. Peru has similarly provided compensation to a girl who was denied access to abortion as a result of the committee's decision. The Committee Against Torture has also found total abortion bans to constitute a violation of its provisions. The international community has already responded with outrage to the Dobbs ruling and how devastating it will be for pregnant people in the United States. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called the decision \"a huge blow to women's human rights and gender equality.\" The ruling has also drawn criticism from the WHO and human rights experts , as well as the leaders of allied countries, including France , Canada , and Belgium . French political leaders have announced that they are seeking to amend their Constitution to explicitly protect abortion to better cement protections, saying, \"What happened elsewhere must not happen in France.\" To be sure, an international human rights strategy is just one part of a multifaceted approach that needs to be taken in the United States to build back the framework of reproductive rights in this country-and one that is far stronger than the frame overturned by Dobbs . But as we watch the decimation of rights and confront the limits of a 200+ year-old constitutional framework, it is imperative that Democratic leaders and activists look outward, with humility, and learn from the countries expanding rights , not restricting them. And it is far past time that the United States subjected itself to a human rights framework that it helped to build for others but has zealously withheld from its own people.\n\nThe recently released guidelines on abortion from the World Health Organization (WHO) provide an important blueprint for the way forward. Taking an approach that melds health and human rights, the guidelines recommend that countries fully decriminalize abortion , have abortion be available on request , and do not regulate abortion based on the circumstances of the condition (for example only allowing access in cases of rape) nor based on gestational limits . This expansive foundation for abortion rights stands in stark contrast to the legal basis for Roe , whose constitutional privacy frame and somewhat arbitrary line of \"viability\" proved to be extremely vulnerable to attack. To use a cliche, the human rights approach is how we \" build back better .\" Related Article Biden's Troubling Response to \"Dobbs\" Andrea Grimes and The Nation This will require a fundamental shift in how US government officials and elites in domestic and foreign policy spaces view human rights. The United States often positions them as an international policy, not a vision for its own governing bodies to pursue. As a result, it's not a surprise that the United States has ratified relatively few international human rights treaties, despite having played a leading role in the development and negotiation of many of these frameworks.

Wade , revels in shaming and punishing women who have abortions and the doctors who perform them. It is the crowning achievement of a Christian nationalist movement that has come to dominate American politics, consolidating its power in the Trump era. Centered on what it claims are biblical imperatives about sexual purity, this movement represents a minority view in the country as a whole, but a majority of the Supreme Court and legislatures in red states. This article was produced in partnership with Type Investigations . The Supreme Court's decision, if finalized, will be the most powerful endorsement of the movement's trend of imposing increasingly punitive measures against reproductive rights. The past year alone has already seen a rash of attempts (and some successes) by Republican leaders and legislators to criminalize abortion, and to deputize ordinary citizens as bounty hunters in turning in their neighbors, girlfriends, and even complete strangers if they perform an abortion or help someone else do so. But such tactics don't stop with reproductive rights-LGBTQ rights are also under threat by similarly regressive legislative attacks . Led by Arkansas in 2021, Republicans have sought to criminalize health care for trans minors, leading to copycat laws in other states and a state-run campaign in Texas for the child protective services agency to investigate parents of trans kids who receive gender-affirming medical treatments. Alito's opinion in Dobbs not only fulfills the Christian right's decades-long ambition of overturning Roe but very explicitly gives them license to enact the harshest regime they can imagine to defend what they claim are the biblical values of a Christian nation. It creates a post- Roe world in which state legislatures feel more empowered to escalate their attacks not only on reproductive rights but on LGBTQ rights as well. The draft reveals a justice single-mindedly bent on mining the historical record to support his claim that the Anglo-American legal tradition had for centuries prosecuted and punished abortion until a lawless court, in 1973, turned everything upside down. As the historian Cassandra Berman pointed out on Twitter, it is a \"gross mischaracterization\" to claim, as Alito did, that in the United States \"an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973,\" when Roe was decided.

That means that Beare, if this story told in a \"gentleman's\" magazine is accurate, spent two days restrained by her head and hands so that she could be exposed to public scorn and ridicule. Alito's citation of the case recalls the time, in 2009, when the anti-choice activist Lila Rose suggested to the Values Voter Summit that abortions take place \"in the public square\" so that people would rebel against them in disgust. Alito spends considerable time detailing how these male legal commentators believed abortion to be \"murder,\" a \"great crime,\" and \"a very heinous misdemeanor.\" The judge in the Beare case, he took time to note, said that \"he had 'never met with a case so barbarous and unnatural.'\" Disgust is the primary tool the Christian right is deploying in its campaign against LGBTQ rights as well. As I have reported for Type Investigations , movement leaders have been unequivocal that their strategy to erode and eventually overturn Obergefell v. Hodges , the landmark 2015 case striking down bans on marriage equality, will mirror the one they deployed against Roe . In other words, until the time comes that the Supreme Court is ready to strike it down, they will work in and with state legislatures to chip away at that right-by claiming, for example, that religious freedom demands that they be exempt from laws protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, or by attempting to restrict the rights of same-sex couples to adopt children or other rights adjacent to their constitutionally protected marriage rights. One of their first campaigns in the post- Obergefell world was to try to ban trans people from gender-appropriate bathrooms and locker rooms. That, too, was based on disgust . More recently, activists and their allies in Republican state legislatures have upped the ante: Not only should trans people be shamed and banished, but their very health care should be considered child abuse and criminalized. Republican legislators have seen results here because anti-choice and anti-LGBTQ activists hold considerable sway in red statehouses. That's why Alito's bizarre claim that Roe 's opponents \"could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views\" is so dangerous. Not only is it factually wrong-the whole reason the Dobbs case was before the court was because anti-choice activists had spent decades trying to find a case to overturn Roe by passing ever-more draconian laws in state legislatures-it perpetuates Christian right's sense of victimhood in a secular culture.

In his dissent in Obergefell , Alito wrote, \"I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.\" In the draft Dobbs opinion, Alito protests that abortion is \"unique\" and therefore his opinion does not endanger other rights, including LGBTQ rights. Alito cites Obergefell and Lawrence v. Texas , the 2003 case striking down laws criminalizing sodomy, as evidence that the court can and will overturn faulty precedent, as a justification for why he believes Roe should be overturned. But elsewhere in the opinion he signals that, just as with Roe , the rights secured in Lawrence and Obergefell do not have \"any claim to being deeply rooted in history.\" By the logic of his opinion-and the known ambitions of the religious right-those rights are in grave danger, just as reproductive rights are. The consequences are not difficult to imagine. An overturning of Lawrence could embolden anti-LGBTQ legislators to revitalize anti-sodomy laws. Millions of Americans could be exposed to criminal liability for their private sexual conduct. In the closing of his opinion, Alito sets his virtuous but supposedly repressed foot soldiers free. \"The Constitution,\" he writes, \"does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion.\" By overruling Roe , he writes, the court will \"return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\" He's wrong that they felt disempowered before, but he is ominously right that they are going to feel even more empowered now.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with Type Investigations .\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision, if finalized, will be the most powerful endorsement of the movement's trend of imposing increasingly punitive measures against reproductive rights. The past year alone has already seen a rash of attempts (and some successes) by Republican leaders and legislators to criminalize abortion, and to deputize ordinary citizens as bounty hunters in turning in their neighbors, girlfriends, and even complete strangers if they perform an abortion or help someone else do so. But such tactics don't stop with reproductive rights-LGBTQ rights are also under threat by similarly regressive legislative attacks . Led by Arkansas in 2021, Republicans have sought to criminalize health care for trans minors, leading to copycat laws in other states and a state-run campaign in Texas for the child protective services agency to investigate parents of trans kids who receive gender-affirming medical treatments. Alito's opinion in Dobbs not only fulfills the Christian right's decades-long ambition of overturning Roe but very explicitly gives them license to enact the harshest regime they can imagine to defend what they claim are the biblical values of a Christian nation. It creates a post- Roe world in which state legislatures feel more empowered to escalate their attacks not only on reproductive rights but on LGBTQ rights as well. The draft reveals a justice single-mindedly bent on mining the historical record to support his claim that the Anglo-American legal tradition had for centuries prosecuted and punished abortion until a lawless court, in 1973, turned everything upside down. As the historian Cassandra Berman pointed out on Twitter, it is a \"gross mischaracterization\" to claim, as Alito did, that in the United States \"an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973,\" when Roe was decided. In fact, through the 18th century, and until the 19th century, American common law permitted abortions before \"quickening,\" the point at which the fetus's movements could be felt.

But elsewhere in the opinion he signals that, just as with Roe , the rights secured in Lawrence and Obergefell do not have \"any claim to being deeply rooted in history.\" By the logic of his opinion-and the known ambitions of the religious right-those rights are in grave danger, just as reproductive rights are. The consequences are not difficult to imagine. An overturning of Lawrence could embolden anti-LGBTQ legislators to revitalize anti-sodomy laws. Millions of Americans could be exposed to criminal liability for their private sexual conduct. In the closing of his opinion, Alito sets his virtuous but supposedly repressed foot soldiers free. \"The Constitution,\" he writes, \"does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion.\" By overruling Roe , he writes, the court will \"return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\" He's wrong that they felt disempowered before, but he is ominously right that they are going to feel even more empowered now.\n\nOne of their first campaigns in the post- Obergefell world was to try to ban trans people from gender-appropriate bathrooms and locker rooms. That, too, was based on disgust . More recently, activists and their allies in Republican state legislatures have upped the ante: Not only should trans people be shamed and banished, but their very health care should be considered child abuse and criminalized. Republican legislators have seen results here because anti-choice and anti-LGBTQ activists hold considerable sway in red statehouses. That's why Alito's bizarre claim that Roe 's opponents \"could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views\" is so dangerous. Not only is it factually wrong-the whole reason the Dobbs case was before the court was because anti-choice activists had spent decades trying to find a case to overturn Roe by passing ever-more draconian laws in state legislatures-it perpetuates Christian right's sense of victimhood in a secular culture.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Lots of factors played a role in the Republicans' underperformance in the midterm elections, but it sure seems like the decision by conservative justices on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade was a major one. The United States Senate might have been handed back to Democrats by Samuel Alito and his extremist ruling-signed, of course, by all five of the other conservatives. One person looking to press the policy advantage Democrats currently enjoy is President Joe Biden. Over the weekend , with the House of Representatives still technically up for grabs, White House senior aide Anita Dunn went on TV to reiterate Biden's stance that Congress should \"codify Roe vs. Wade , so that it is the national law of the land.\" Biden understands that the voters have spoken, and he's positioning his administration and the Democrats as the people who want to give the voters what they want. And what they want is to not have Ted Cruz anywhere near their uteruses. I want that to happen. I think Democrats should use maximal power to enshrine abortion rights, including getting rid of the filibuster if need be. It's the right move both in terms of policy (reproductive rights should trump states' rights) and in terms of politics. But people should operate without any illusions: If the Democrats somehow pass a national law codifying Roe v. Wade , the conservative justices will use the emergency \"shadow docket\" to prevent it from taking effect and then strike it down later, when it is electorally convenient for them to do so. The idea that the conservative Supreme Court would respect an act of Congress that they don't like is a fantasy invented by Republican strategists eager to mask the true nature of our extremist court. It is pushed by mainstream media folks and court insiders in D.C. who are desperate to portray Chief Justice John Roberts as a good guy so they don't sound too \"partisan.\" It is untethered from reality: There is simply no evidence that this court would allow national abortion protections to hold. The court has revoked abortion as a federal right, which is important because that limits Congress's options. Arguably, Congress is unable to pass a national abortion protection pursant to its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment's grant of equal protection and due process, because the court denies that such grants extend to the right to choose. Other major pieces of legislation, like the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act, exist only because the court acknowledges (or at least used to acknowledge) those laws as \"necessary\" to enforce the 14th and 15th amendments, respectively. I think the court is wrong and that Congress should have the authority to protect abortion rights under the 14th Amendment, but I will not be ascending to the Supreme Court anytime soon.

And I'm sorry to say that we have a ton of evidence that this court takes a dim view of the government's power to regulate health and safety. Back in January of this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers. The court, by an entirely predictable vote of 6-3, ruled that the Biden administration exceeded its authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect private employees from Covid. Indeed, throughout the pandemic, we saw the Supreme Court either strike down emergency measures relating to the crisis (like the eviction moratorium) or leave in place lower court rulings that did the same. Current Issue View our current issue Oh, but these are executive actions, you say? The court will have more respect for a health-and-safety act of Congress, you imagine? Well, let me remind you of the granddaddy of all congressional health-and-safety actions: the Affordable Care Act. People think of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius as the 2015 case where Roberts \"saved\" Obamacare, but let's remember what really happened there. On a far less extremist court, there were five votes-including one by Roberts-to invalidate the ACA as an unconstitutional use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. The trick Roberts used to save the law was to convert the ACA from a regulatory action of Congress into a tax. It was a brilliant bit of legal obfuscation that has given Roberts his undeserved reputation of being a moderate. But make no mistake: At the beating heart of NFIB is a shocking denial of congressional authority to regulate the standard of health care that must be provided in the various states. Conservative justices barely allowed Congress to pass a minimum level of insurance coverage , but now we're supposed to believe they will let the federal government force states to provide abortions? Have you met these people? Speaking about who these people are in real life, I haven't even mentioned that these conservatives are actively trying to usher in a fundamentalist Christian theocracy and force the rest of us to live in it. The religious views of justices like Samuel Alito, alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barret are already on the record. But people forget that Roberts's wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts, was a fierce forced-birth advocate before she pulled back on her public life to avoid the appearance of impropriety with Roberts on the court. People do remember that Clarence Thomas, and his wife, hold the same views and don't care about the appearance of corruption. That's five justices whose personal views, I believe, prevent them from ever allowing the government to protect the rights of women and pregnant people, law be damned (see their ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization for more evidence). The sixth conservative, Neil Gorsuch, barely suffers the federal government to exist. The only potential hope that abortion protections might survive this Supreme Court lies in the justices' recognition of the political gravity of their position. The justices can read exit polls, same as the rest of us. Roberts likes to deliver electorally justifiable rulings to the Republicans. Kavanaugh is so desperate to be treated by the media like Roberts gets treated that you can almost smell it on him. If they read the tea leaves, there's at least a very small chance that they would uphold national abortion protections because that would be the only way to help the Republican Party. A watered-down, bare-minimum version of abortion protections (the only kind \"Democrats\" like Joe Manchin would ever vote for in an election year), with exceptions for rape and incest, largely takes the issue off the table for the upcoming presidential election cycle. Moreover, if the court were to strike down such a bill, it would only increase the calls for Democrats to expand the court, something we know the conservatives currently looking forward to holding 30 years of unaccountable power do not want. If the GOP were a functional political party, it would jump at this chance to appear reasonable; Republicans in Congress would release their vulnerable colleagues to support Roe v. Wade ; McConnell would muster up nine or 10 votes in the Senate to obviate calls to end the filibuster; and Roberts would find some way to make it all work. But they won't do these things, because conservatives are not in a political party; they're in an ideological cult. Understanding this is key to understanding why the Supreme Court will never allow a law protecting abortion rights to exist, so long as conservatives hold the balance of power. Democrats should force the issue anyway. The more people see what this extremist court does, the more people will be willing to stop them.\n\nOne person looking to press the policy advantage Democrats currently enjoy is President Joe Biden.

Jackson Women's Health Organization for more evidence). The sixth conservative, Neil Gorsuch, barely suffers the federal government to exist. The only potential hope that abortion protections might survive this Supreme Court lies in the justices' recognition of the political gravity of their position. The justices can read exit polls, same as the rest of us. Roberts likes to deliver electorally justifiable rulings to the Republicans. Kavanaugh is so desperate to be treated by the media like Roberts gets treated that you can almost smell it on him. If they read the tea leaves, there's at least a very small chance that they would uphold national abortion protections because that would be the only way to help the Republican Party. A watered-down, bare-minimum version of abortion protections (the only kind \"Democrats\" like Joe Manchin would ever vote for in an election year), with exceptions for rape and incest, largely takes the issue off the table for the upcoming presidential election cycle. Moreover, if the court were to strike down such a bill, it would only increase the calls for Democrats to expand the court, something we know the conservatives currently looking forward to holding 30 years of unaccountable power do not want. If the GOP were a functional political party, it would jump at this chance to appear reasonable; Republicans in Congress would release their vulnerable colleagues to support Roe v. Wade ; McConnell would muster up nine or 10 votes in the Senate to obviate calls to end the filibuster; and Roberts would find some way to make it all work. But they won't do these things, because conservatives are not in a political party; they're in an ideological cult. Understanding this is key to understanding why the Supreme Court will never allow a law protecting abortion rights to exist, so long as conservatives hold the balance of power. Democrats should force the issue anyway. The more people see what this extremist court does, the more people will be willing to stop them.\n\nBut people should operate without any illusions: If the Democrats somehow pass a national law codifying Roe v. Wade , the conservative justices will use the emergency \"shadow docket\" to prevent it from taking effect and then strike it down later, when it is electorally convenient for them to do so. The idea that the conservative Supreme Court would respect an act of Congress that they don't like is a fantasy invented by Republican strategists eager to mask the true nature of our extremist court. It is pushed by mainstream media folks and court insiders in D.C. who are desperate to portray Chief Justice John Roberts as a good guy so they don't sound too \"partisan.\" It is untethered from reality: There is simply no evidence that this court would allow national abortion protections to hold. The court has revoked abortion as a federal right, which is important because that limits Congress's options. Arguably, Congress is unable to pass a national abortion protection pursant to its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment's grant of equal protection and due process, because the court denies that such grants extend to the right to choose. Other major pieces of legislation, like the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act, exist only because the court acknowledges (or at least used to acknowledge) those laws as \"necessary\" to enforce the 14th and 15th amendments, respectively. I think the court is wrong and that Congress should have the authority to protect abortion rights under the 14th Amendment, but I will not be ascending to the Supreme Court anytime soon.

Back in January of this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers.

Current Issue View our current issue Oh, but these are executive actions, you say? The court will have more respect for a health-and-safety act of Congress, you imagine?

Sebelius as the 2015 case where Roberts \"saved\" Obamacare, but let's remember what really happened there. On a far less extremist court, there were five votes-including one by Roberts-to invalidate the ACA as an unconstitutional use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. The trick Roberts used to save the law was to convert the ACA from a regulatory action of Congress into a tax. It was a brilliant bit of legal obfuscation that has given Roberts his undeserved reputation of being a moderate.

Wade\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nA short history of the landmark case.\n\nBy Derrick Bryson Taylor\n\nNearly 50 years ago, the Supreme Court legalized abortion in the United States with its decision in Roe v. Wade , reshaping the nation's social and political landscape.\n\nOn Monday night, Politico published a leaked draft opinion that said the Supreme Court had privately voted to strike down the decision, setting the stage for abortion-rights battles across the nation and prompting a wave of protests at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.\n\nHere are some quick facts you should know about the case.\n\nThe 7-2 ruling was announced on Jan. 22, 1973. Justice Harry A. Blackmun , a modest Midwestern Republican and a defender of the right to abortion, wrote the majority opinion .\n\nIn short, it is a landmark Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. The ruling struck down laws in many states that had barred abortion, declaring that they could not ban the procedure before the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb.\n\nThat point, known as fetal viability, was around 28 weeks when Roe was decided. Today, because of improvements in medicine, most experts now estimate fetal viability to be about 23 or 24 weeks .\n\nIn 1970, a woman in Texas named Norma McCorvey was five months pregnant with her third child and wanted to have an abortion. Two Dallas lawyers, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, represented her in challenging the state's prohibition on abortions except to save a mother's life.\n\nJane Roe was a pseudonym for Ms. McCorvey, who was 22 when her case was filed. She later spoke out against abortion, but in a documentary in 2020, Ms. McCorvey said she had done so only because she was paid for her advocacy. She died in 2017 at 69.\n\n\"Wade\" refers to the defendant, Henry Wade, who was the district attorney in Dallas County, Texas, at the time. Mr. Wade died in 2001 at 86.\n\nRoe v. Wade created the framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women's health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother.\n\nIn 1992, the court tossed the trimester framework in Planned Parenthood v. Casey . However, Casey retained Roe's \"essential holding,\" meaning that women have a constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies until fetal viability.\n\nDerrick Bryson Taylor is a general assignment reporter.

The number of abortions will probably fall, particularly among poor women in the South and Midwest.\n\nBy Claire Cain Miller and Margot Sanger-Katz\n\nFollow our live updates on the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade .\n\nFriday's Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade will usher in a United States not seen in half a century, in which the legal status of abortion is entirely up to the states. Now that the law has changed, reproductive rights will be rewritten almost immediately.\n\nNo. Individual states will decide whether and when abortions will be legal. Many states will continue to allow them, and some have even begun making provisions to help serve women who live in states that are likely to restrict abortion.\n\nAbortion will probably become illegal in about half of states, although forecasts differ.\n\nAccording to the Center for Reproductive Rights, a group that fights abortion restrictions in court and closely tracks state laws, 25 states are likely to ban abortion . Those states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a research group focused on reproductive health care, says a slightly different group of states is likely to substantially limit abortion access: Its list of 26 states excludes North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but includes Florida, Iowa and Montana.\n\nThirteen states have so-called trigger laws, which make abortion illegal after Roe's fall. Some have old abortion laws on the books that were invalidated by the Roe decision but could be enforced again. Still other states, like Oklahoma, have abortion bans that were passed during this legislative session , despite the Roe precedent.\n\nThe typical patient is already a mother; is poor; is unmarried and in her late 20s; and has some college education.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Wade\n\nBehind the Scenes at the Dismantling of Roe v. Wade\n\nSupported by\n\nOn Feb. 10 last year, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. showed his eight colleagues how he intended to uproot the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nAt 11:16 a.m., his clerk circulated a 98-page draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. After a justice shares an opinion inside the court, other members scrutinize it. Those in the majority can request revisions, sometimes as the price of their votes, sweating sentences or even words.\n\nBut this time, despite the document's length, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote back just 10 minutes later to say that he would sign on to the opinion and had no changes, according to two people who reviewed the messages. The next morning, Justice Clarence Thomas added his name, then Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and days later, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. None requested a single alteration. The responses looked like a display of conservative force and discipline.\n\nIn the months since, that draft turned into a leak, then law, then the rare Supreme Court decision that affects the entire country, reshaping elections, the practice of medicine and a fundamental aspect of being female. The story of how this happened has seemed obvious: The constitutional right to abortion effectively died with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom President Donald J. Trump replaced with a favorite of the anti-abortion movement, Justice Barrett.\n\nBut that version is far from complete. Justice Barrett, selected to clinch the court's conservative supermajority and deliver the nearly 50-year goal of the religious right, opposed even taking up the case. When the jurists were debating Mississippi's request to hear it, she first voted in favor - but later switched to a no, according to several court insiders and a written tally. Four male justices, a minority of the court, chose to move ahead anyway, with Justice Kavanaugh providing the final vote.\n\nThose dynamics help explain why the responses stacked up so speedily to the draft opinion in February 2022: Justice Alito appeared to have pregamed it among some of the conservative justices, out of view from other colleagues, to safeguard a coalition more fragile than it looked.\n\nJustice Samuel A.

Wade, some women are reconsidering their plans, including where they live, and wondering how best to channel their anger.\n\nBy Julie Bosman\n\nCHICAGO - Countless women wept. Some spent the weekend burning white-hot with rage, commiserating with friends and mothers and sisters. Many were fearful, recognizing the feeling of a freedom being taken away and thinking to themselves: This could only get worse.\n\nMillions of American women spent the past five days absorbing the news that the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , erasing the constitutional right to a legal abortion that had held for nearly a half-century.\n\nThe decision instantly reordered the lives of women across the country.\n\nSome women, especially conservative Christians, reveled in the decision as a moral and legal victory. But a poll released on Sunday revealed that a sizable majority of women in the United States - 67 percent - opposed the court's ruling to overturn Roe, and 52 percent of Americans said it was a step backward for the nation.\n\nFor women who had sought abortions in states where clinics were forced to shutter, the ruling was an immediate catastrophe, jeopardizing their decision to terminate their pregnancies.\n\nYet the decision reached far beyond them - across generations and geography, across race and class. Many women were sent spinning, questioning their place in society, at least in the eyes of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn dozens of interviews this week, American women who support abortion rights recalled the moment when they heard that Roe had been overturned, and the waves of shock and fury that followed. They reflected on how access to legal abortion had quietly undergirded their personal decisions, even if they had never sought one themselves. They worried that the progress many women have made since abortion was legalized - in education, the workplace and in the culture - would be halted.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Wade's reversal has elicited cries of anger and despair from those who feel a sense of dread for the future of women and the future of America.\n\nI understand that feeling of dread.\n\nAs a pro-life advocate, I lament with those who feel they have lost a basic human right, as well as moral agency and hope for the future. But for me it is Roe that brought these losses.\n\nRoe stripped from the prenatal child the right to continue to live and grow, safe and free from intentional harm. If you believe, as I do, that abortion unjustly ends the life of a being that is fully human, a life that exists independently of the will of the mother, is self-organizing and unique, developing yet complete in itself, then you will understand Roe not as a ruling that liberates but as one that dehumanizes, first the fetus, then the rest of us.\n\nFurther, Roe elevated radical autonomy over moral agency. Roe struck down the hope that is inherent in every human life, whether new or old, for as long as life remains.\n\nRoe was an unjust ruling. I have always believed it would be overturned, as other unjust decisions by the court were, although I thought it would take longer. I rejoice that it did not.

It has worked against the public's status quo bias, which made Roe v. Wade itself popular, even if the country remained conflicted about the underlying issue. Against the near-universal consensus of the media, academic and expert class. Against the desires of politicians who were nominally supportive of its cause, the preferences of substantial portions of American conservatism's donor class.\n\nAcross all those years the pro-life cause also swam against the sociological and religious currents of American life, which have favored social liberalism and secularization. It found little vocal support among Hollywood's culture-shapers and crusaders for social justice, or the corporate entities that have lately embraced so many progressive causes. It was hampered by the hiddenness of the injustice it opposed, the voicelessness of the constituency on whose behalf it tried to speak.\n\nAnd it worked against the weight of the American class hierarchy, since pro-life sentiment is stronger among less-educated and lower-income Americans - exactly the wrong constituency to start with, according to cynics and realists alike, if you want to pressure the elite or change the world.\n\nMore, the pro-life movement has had to succeed twice. It's entirely true that the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade is the work of a somewhat accidental supermajority, created by the haphazard interaction between judicial mortality and Donald Trump's unlikely victory.\n\nBut it's also true that the anti-abortion side already built an apparent high court majority the standard way, in the Reagan era, by supporting Republican presidents who won big, popular majorities and appointed a raft of justices whose philosophy was supposedly opposed to the liberal policymaking of the Warren court.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established abortion rights. The three conservative justices whom Donald Trump appointed to the court supplied the votes to finally do so.\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority.\n\nRoe's fall is a political and social earthquake, one that Americans alternately celebrated and mourned . \"I cannot think of a precedent for this in our modern history, where you have an individual civil right that people depend on that has been rolled back after 50 years,\" said my colleague Emily Bazelon, who writes about abortion access and the court.\n\nYesterday's ruling won't end the abortion debate, but it will fundamentally alter it. Today's newsletter explains what the decision means, and what may follow.\n\nThe ruling promptly shifted the political fight over abortion to the state level. That was, Alito wrote, one of the court's aims: \"The authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\" (Here's an annotated version of the ruling , which largely tracked the draft that leaked to Politico last month.)\n\nRoe's fall immediately triggered abortion bans in Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota. Missouri, Arkansas and other states did the same within hours. In total, more than 20 states appear set to outlaw all or nearly all abortions.

      "text": "How Did Roe Fall? Before a Decisive Ruling, a Powerful Red Wave.\n\nBy Kate Zernike June 25, 2022\n\nThe beginning of the end of Roe v. Wade arrived on election night in November 2010.\n\nThat night, control of state houses across the country flipped from Democrat to Republican, almost to the number: Democrats had controlled 27 state legislatures going in and ended up with 16; Republicans started with 14 and ended up controlling 25. Republicans swept not only the South but Democratic strongholds in the Midwest, picking up more seats nationwide than either party had in four decades. By the time the votes had been counted, they held their biggest margin since the Great Depression.\n\nThere had been a time, in the 15 years after Roe, when Republicans were as likely as Democrats to support an absolute right to legal abortion , and sometimes even more so. But 2010 swept in a different breed of Republican, powered by Tea Party supporters, that locked in a new conservatism. While Tea Party-backed candidates had campaigned on fiscal discipline and promised indifference to social issues, once in office they found it difficult to cut state budgets. And a well-established network was waiting with model anti-abortion laws.\n\nIn legislative sessions starting the following January, Republican-led states passed a record number of restrictions : 92, or nearly three times as many as the previous high, set in 2005.\n\nThe three years following the 2010 elections would result in 205 anti-abortion laws across the country, more than in the entire previous decade .\n\n\"A watershed year in the defense of life,\" Charmaine Yoest, at the time president of the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life, proclaimed when the sessions were over, noting that 70 of the laws - restrictions on abortion pills and hurdles for women getting abortions and clinics providing them - had adopted the group's model legislation. \"And that is just the beginning.\"\n\n\"It was a massacre,\" said Beth Shipp, then the political director of NARAL Pro-Choice America, which had been founded before Roe to push for abortion rights.\n\nIn the fraught and much disputed language of pregnancy, the elections of 2010 were the quickening of the anti-abortion movement. The movement started out weak but gained power in the new red wave. Abortion rights groups, meanwhile, were weakened in the states. The ensuing debates in state legislatures pointed toward the polarization that would divide the country over the coronavirus pandemic and the presidential election 10 years later: gerrymandered control and party-line votes, and the two sides increasingly operating under a different definition of the facts. And as legislatures continued to layer restrictions upon restrictions, anti-abortion groups could argue to the court what Jeanne Mancini, the president of the March for Life, proclaimed to crowds in Washington this year: \"Roe is not settled law.\"\n\nThe momentum that started in 2010 led to the Supreme Court overturning Roe on Friday, even though polls show that a vast majority of Americans supported it, and that most now believe abortion is morally acceptable . The court's decision lamented that Roe had \"sparked a national controversy that has embittered our popular culture for a half century.\" In fact, that controversy started not so much with Roe but in state houses, and raged hottest over the last decade.\n\n\"Women are asking me all the time - what happened? They have no understanding of how this could be,\" said Cecile Richards, who was president of Planned Parenthood from 2005 to 2018. \"What's happened is not about religion, or morality or unborn babies. It's about politics. Women can't wrap their brains around it. Republicans want to pretend it's about something else. But it's about control - that's what politics is about.\"\n\nEven some of the most ardent anti-abortion activists did not see the shift coming.\n\nIn 2009, the country seemed settled around the idea that abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare,\" in the phrase coined by Bill Clinton. States had passed restrictions that lined up with public opinion, requiring parental consent and waiting periods for abortions. Ballot initiatives to ban abortion in South Dakota and Colorado had failed in 2008, and another failed in Colorado in 2010.\n\n\"At either extreme people were unhappy, but essentially everybody could live with that compromise,\" said Neal Devins, a law professor at William and Mary and the author of a 2009 article in The Yale Law Journal headlined, \"How Planned Parenthood v. Casey (Pretty Much) Settled the Abortion Wars.\" The contentious Casey decision, in 1992, had reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade - that states could not ban abortion before a fetus was viable outside the womb, or about 23 weeks - but allowed states to impose restrictions on abortion so long as they did not impose an \"undue burden\" on women.\n\nFor the most part, Professor Devins's article argued, state lawmakers hated talking about abortion and liked that the court had given them cover to pass some restrictions, but not ones that might contradict public opinion.\n\nIn May 2009, an anti-abortion extremist fatally shot Dr. George Tiller , one of the nation's only providers of late-term abortion, in his church, damaging the image of abortion opponents. Abortion rights groups were also riding a string of victories. \"In 2006 and 2008 we made great gains with pro-choice Dems and some pro-choice Republicans,\" Ms. Shipp, at NARAL, recalled. \"We had the largest majorities in the House, we had the majority in the Senate.\"\n\n\"What's happened is not about religion, or morality or unborn babies. It's about politics.\"\n\nThey had secured health insurance coverage for birth control in Obamacare, and fended off congressional Republicans' attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"We were dead in the water,\" said Chuck Donovan, a longtime legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee. Except to fight over state funding on tax credits for health insurance, \"pro-life didn't have a movement.\" Demographics were moving the country toward a more diverse majority that was presumed to lean left. Anti-abortion forces feared the re-election of Barack Obama and six more years of potential appointments to the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublican strategists, however, had an eye on the states in the 2010 midterms. In The Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush's victories, wrote that a group called the Republican State Leadership Committee was aiming to flip 18 legislative chambers where Democrats were holding the majority by four or fewer seats. Because it was a census year, taking control of state legislatures would give Republicans power over redistricting.\n\nThe group spent just $30 million - less than the cost of some Senate races. Republicans won 680 seats, more than the Democrats had won in the post-Watergate election of 1974.\n\nIn another year, the swing in party control might not have given much hope to anti-abortion forces. They had failed to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion even with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House in the 1980s, and failed to get a favorable Casey decision even with Republican appointees dominating the court. A decade later, the party had set up a \"big tent\" to include abortion rights supporters, with Roger Stone, the future Trump operative, advising Republicans for Choice, a group led by his wife.\n\nThe Republicans of 2010 had been backed by the Tea Party, which had swelled in protest over Obamacare in the summer of 2009. Polls found that about 60 percent of Tea Party supporters thought that abortion should be illegal, and about half identified as part of the Religious Right, a coalition that had belatedly come together after Roe, in 1980, to oppose abortion.\n\nDemocrats control both chambers\n\nHalf of states\n\nSplit control\n\nRepublicans control both chambers\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\nMajority control\n\nSplit/Nonpartisan\n\nDemocrats control both chambers\n\nHalf of states\n\nSplit control\n\nRepublicans control both chambers\n\n1980\n\n2020\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\nOver the next year, Republican-led chambers passed more restrictions on abortion than in any year since the Roe decision in 1973.\n\nMany of the earliest bills reflected the bitterness of the Obamacare debate. They prohibited insurance coverage of abortion and eliminated public funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nOthers added delays for women seeking abortions: ultrasounds, counseling from anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers and waiting periods. South Dakota's 24-hour waiting period became 72 hours. Six states mandated that parental notification for abortions be notarized. North Carolina required women to receive counseling that abortion could damage their ability to get pregnant and cause lasting mental health consequences - claims unsupported by medical studies.\n\nMany of the bills copied model legislation from anti-abortion groups such as Americans United for Life or the National Right to Life Committee that had stalled in committee in previous years. Now they were gliding through two Republican-controlled chambers to the governor's pen. \"It wasn't that they were coming up with new ideas,\" said Donna Crane, then the policy director at NARAL. \"It's just that the goalie got pulled.\"\n\nThe new laws accelerated the strategy that anti-abortion groups had embraced since their failure to secure the constitutional amendment against abortion in the 1980s: If they could not topple Roe in one nationwide swoop, they would go state by state passing laws that chipped away at what it allowed. By destabilizing it, they would undermine its legitimacy.\n\nA young Justice Department lawyer named Samuel A. Alito Jr. had articulated this strategy in a 1985 memo advising the Reagan administration to enter an amicus brief seeking to uphold abortion restrictions in Pennsylvania. The department ultimately had to push to overturn Roe v. Wade, he wrote, but a \"frontal assault\" on the decision's holding on viability - that abortion was protected until the fetus could survive outside the womb - risked the Supreme Court \"summarily rejecting\" an outright ban. Instead, abortion opponents had to make the case that more incremental laws were \"eminently reasonable and legitimate.\"\n\nBut there was a divide in the movement between those who argued for incrementalism and those who wanted the frontal assault. James Bopp Jr., a conservative lawyer who had fought abortion since Roe and in 1980 wrote the first anti-abortion plank into the Republican platform, tried to reinforce the message for discipline in 2007, as restive anti-abortion groups pushed for outright bans on abortion starting at conception. These efforts were only \"doomed to expensive failure,\" Mr. Bopp wrote in a memo that year , and would only end up enriching Planned Parenthood and other groups that would win legal fees in court challenges.\n\nMore damaging, he wrote, \"there is the potential danger that the court might actually make things worse than they presently are,\" by reinforcing Roe's declaration of a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBy the end of 2011, five states - Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and Oklahoma - had followed Nebraska's lead to ban abortion before viability. They prohibited abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, asserting that the fetus could then feel pain.\n\n\"One of the dynamics that drove this was a kind of frustration,\" Mr. Bopp said. \"'Look how long it's been, we need to force the court.' There was a natural frustration which makes people willing to take more risks, or do things differently.\"\n\n\"There is the potential danger that the court might actually make things worse than they presently are.\"\n\nIn March 2011, the new Republican supermajority in the Arizona Legislature passed the nation's first bill banning abortion when the woman's decision was based on the sex or race of the fetus, one of many that aimed to portray abortion providers as sexist, racist and supporters of eugenics. The bill had been pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, which had been founded in 1995 largely to support anti-abortion legislation.\n\nThe bill's sponsors named it the Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act. On the floor, they cited a few studies - one including just 65 women - that suggested some immigrants from countries such as India and China, where there has been a traditional preference for sons, faced pressure to abort female fetuses.\n\n\"This was an issue that didn't exist,\" said Katie Hobbs, a Democrat elected to the Arizona House that year. \"But how do you fight against that without sounding like you actually support people aborting babies because they are a race or gender that they don't want?\" If the bill was \"ludicrous,\" she said, \"it kept the issue at the forefront, made it look like the Democrats were supporting these extreme measures, and why wouldn't you want to stop them?\"\n\nThe law punished providers, making violations a felony. Within two years, five other states had copied it, and North Dakota started a trend of bans on abortion based on diagnoses of Down syndrome and other genetic abnormalities.\n\nSue Liebel, an anti-abortion activist in Indiana at that time who became state director of what is now Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, founded in 1992 to support anti-abortion candidates, called it \"pent-up demand after years of pro-choice control.\"\n\n\"This was a red wave - it kind of rolled across the country,\" she said.\n\nBy early 2012, a report from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, declared a \"seismic shift\" and the end of consensus on abortion. More than half of women of childbearing age lived in states the report deemed hostile to abortion rights - 15 million more than a decade earlier. A chunk of states in the Midwest, and the entire South, had moved to hostile ground.\n\nAmericans United for Life noted the Guttmacher ratings as an accomplishment in its own annual report that year, giving Kansas and Arizona, two newly \"hostile\" states, awards for \"most improved.\"\n\nMany of the new laws were bucking public opinion. Polls at the time showed that more than half of Americans thought that abortion should be legal if a child would be born with a life-threatening illness or \"mentally disabled,\" or when the mother's mental health was endangered. A majority did not support blocking federal funding for abortions. And three-quarters thought there should be an exception to save the life of the mother even in the last three months of pregnancy.\n\nIn 2011, even as their State Legislature was tightening restrictions on abortion, Mississippi voters rejected a ballot initiative on \"fetal personhood\" that would have declared that life begins at conception.\n\nBut polls also showed the issue becoming more partisan . Increasingly, Republicans were identifying as \"pro-life\" and Democrats as \"pro-choice.\" Support for abortion rights had once depended largely on education and economic status, but now depended mostly on party affiliation, with Democrats moving sharply toward supporting abortion rights.\n\nAnd while Republicans and anti-abortion forces were increasingly working in concert to turn the states to their advantage, abortion rights supporters accused Democrats of all but giving up on local elections.\n\n\"On the far right, they realized that the most lasting impact of 2010 would be in the states,\" said Daniel Squadron, a former New York state senator and the executive director of the States Project, which was founded by Democrats in 2017 to try to win back control of legislatures. \"On our side, state power was a footnote. The lesson we took was 'Focus more on midterms'; the lesson they took was 'Wield power in states.' And today, both sides are reaping what we sowed.\"\n\nAbortion rights groups lacked the infrastructure their opponents had in the states. NARAL had cut its number of state affiliates nearly in half between 1991 and 2011. And with Democrats in the glow of winning Congress in 2006 and electing the nation's first Black president two years later, abortion rights groups were having trouble convincing big donors and grass-roots supporters alike that Roe was in trouble.\n\nDonors liked to support congressional and presidential elections, and tended to go away when they perceived that the threat had disappeared. \"When you were trying to convince them they had to put money into Kansas or Nebraska, they were like, 'That's futile,'\" said Nancy Keenan, the president of NARAL at the time.\n\nOpponents of abortion rights had always proved easier to mobilize than supporters. In polls and focus groups, NARAL asked women who were sympathetic to its cause what it would take to get them to be more active in protecting Roe v. Wade. \"Consistently,\" Ms. Keenan said, \"We received answers saying, 'If they overturn it.'\"\n\nSome younger activists were pushing abortion rights groups to stop apologizing for or seeking compromise on abortion. To the new generation, abortion was health care, and bodily autonomy was not something to be compromised. The Democratic Party platform in 2012 left in \"safe\" and \"legal\" but took out \"rare.\"\n\n\"When you were trying to convince them they had to put money into Kansas or Nebraska, they were like, 'That's futile.'\"\n\nAnti-abortion groups exploited this, portraying the Democrats' position on abortion as anytime, anywhere, under any circumstance, and paid for with government funds. By contrast, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a 20-week ban looked reasonable, in keeping with what polls showed Americans wanted.\n\n\"Two thousand ten was the year that the light came on about the reality of abortion law in the nation,\" she said. \"It was the year that the polarization between the extreme abortion absolutism and the Republican Party position was a winning contrast. It's the first year that sitting officeholders could see that this issue really helps us. And it just got stronger every election cycle because we would not relent with that contrast.\"\n\nRepublicans running in right-leaning districts backed increasingly strict laws to appeal to reliable anti-abortion voters and avoid primary challenges. By 2016, one analysis found not a single Republican state legislator willing to identify as \"pro-choice.\"\n\nIn the nearly 50 years between the Roe decision and its reversal on Friday, states enacted 1,380 restrictions on abortion. Almost half - 46 percent - were enacted since 2011.\n\nProfessor Devins, of William and Mary, revisited the question of abortion politics in 2016, this time in a paper for The Vanderbilt Law Review. He stuck by his 2009 assessment, but the middle ground he had written of approvingly then had disappeared. \"Today, red state political actors are not interested in compromise,\" Professor Devins wrote in 2016 . With the rightward shift in the Republican Party, abortion rights had become about partisan advantage, along with voter identification laws, tax reform and elimination of public-sector unions.\n\nIn 2015, the Florida Senate had taken just one hour to approve a 24-hour waiting period on abortion, with Republicans rejecting all eight amendments offered by Democrats. Wisconsin had passed its ban on abortion after 20 weeks without a single Democrat. And a bill in Texas to prohibit abortions based on fetal abnormality was brought up for a committee vote after the House had recessed and Democrats were absent.\n\n\"It's conventional wisdom to say that the court's decision in Roe caused the polarization over abortion,\" said Reva Siegel , a law professor at Yale. \"But the court did not cause that polarization. It was the Republican Party's quest for voters - political party competition - that savaged Roe. Once the attack on Roe was underway, the defense needed to be full tilt in politics as well as in the courts - and in all political arenas, state, local and federal. Because over time the attack on Roe has become more than an attack on abortion; it has become an attack on democracy.\"\n\nBy 2019, proponents of the incremental strategy for undoing Roe were losing to those who wanted the frontal attack. With two new conservative justices, the Supreme Court was tilted toward the latter. Momentum was on their side, and states began passing legislation designed to force the court to act. Twenty-week bans had led to 18-week bans, eight-week bans, and now six-week bans.\n\nFirst T r imester\n\nSecond T r imester\n\nThird T r imester\n\nDemocrats\n\n75%\n\nIndependents\n\nRepublicans\n\n50\n\n25\n\n'00\n\n'10\n\n'22\n\n'00\n\n'10\n\n'22\n\n'00\n\n'10\n\n'22\n\nFirst Trimester\n\nSecond Trimester\n\nThird Trimester\n\nDemocrats\n\n75%\n\n75%\n\nIndependents\n\n50\n\n50\n\nRepublicans\n\n25\n\n25\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2022\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2022\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2022\n\nStill, many anti-abortion leaders predicted that the Supreme Court would continue to chip away rather than strike down the decision. Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's only Black justice, had criticized abortion as eugenics. So the next big case, many reasoned, would concern one of the bans on abortion in cases of genetic abnormalities.\n\nInstead, the court took the case regarding a Mississippi law passed in 2018 that banned abortion at 15 weeks.\n\nRepublicans had taken control of the Mississippi Legislature in 2011 - the first time since Reconstruction that Democrats had not controlled the House.\n\n\"It became much easier to navigate these waters and get restrictions passed,\" said Senator Joey Fillingane, a Republican who sponsored numerous anti-abortion bills after being elected in 2000. \"Even though these state Democrats were social conservatives, they still had to answer to the national Democratic Party and received pressure to limit the number of restrictions.\"\n\nRepublicans got smarter about strategy, he said, having women appear as the chief sponsors of anti-abortion legislation to avoid criticism that \"this is just a bunch of white guys trying to tell women how to do their life.\"\n\n\"Over time the attack on Roe has become more than an attack on abortion; it has become an attack on democracy.\"\n\nDuring the two decades when Democrats controlled the chambers, the two parties had often worked together. As the 2011 elections approached, David Baria, then a state representative, recalled discussing strategy with a fellow Democrat who had served for 35 years and was poised to become House speaker. To hold the House, the colleague argued, they would have to make it safe for Democrats to vote for anti-abortion laws and against gun control. Democrats had to be able to go back home and appeal to voters as moderates.\n\nBut the moderates had disappeared. His fellow Democrat lost. Mr. Baria took over as the leader of the new Democratic minority, and party lines were harder than ever. The Republicans were using a text messaging service to convey how members should vote. Soon, he adopted the same for the Democrats.\n\nStill, Mr. Baria thought the vote on the ban in 2018 might be different. Proponents offered no scientific justification for cutting off abortion at that gestational age. The state had already restricted abortion so much that there was only one clinic remaining, and it performed so few abortions after 15 weeks that the provider had declined to file a legal challenge to a 20-week ban. And the proposed 15-week ban included no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nProponents of the bill had mobilized callers, and by 10 to one those who called urged a yes vote on the ban. \"We're a conservative state, but what I would argue is that the majority of callers didn't understand that there were no exceptions for rape or incest,\" Mr. Baria said. \"The message is, are you for or are you against abortion.\"\n\nMr. Baria expected that at least a few Republicans would vote against the bill because it did not have rape or incest exceptions. Instead, even amendments to add those exceptions failed.\n\nFour Democrats in the House and four in the Senate crossed the aisle to vote for the bill. Not a single Republican voted against it.\n\nPhotographs by Craig Hacker, Ilana Panich-Linsman, Scott Olson/Getty Images and Nick Oxford.

      "text": "How the Real Jane Roe Shaped the Abortion Wars\n\nRoe v. Wade may be the rare Supreme Court decision that most Americans can name, but it's also one of the few that many volubly disparage-and not just anti-abortion activists who want to get rid of it altogether. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a staunch advocate of access to abortion but an open critic of the reasoning behind Roe. She thought the rationale should have centered on preventing sex discrimination rather than on preserving a right to privacy. \"The image you get from reading the Roe v. Wade opinion is it's mostly a doctor's-rights case-a doctor's right to prescribe what he thinks his patient needs,\" Ginsburg told the legal writer and scholar Jeffrey Rosen, in 2019. \"My idea of how choice should have developed was not a privacy notion, not a doctor's-right notion, but a woman's right to control her own destiny, to be able to make choices without a Big Brother state telling her what she can and cannot do.\"\n\nGinsburg also declared herself on board with another critique of the decision: namely, that when Roe was handed down, in 1973, it short-circuited a political process whereby states had been gradually legalizing abortion on their own, and thus created the conditions for a polarizing backlash that we are still living through. Although this interpretation is not entirely borne out by the facts-more on that later-it has congealed into conventional wisdom. \"Justice Harry Blackmun did more inadvertent damage to our democracy than any other 20th-century American,\" the columnist David Brooks wrote, in 2005, of the opinion's author. Roe v. Wade, Brooks argued, \"set off a cycle of political viciousness and counter-viciousness that has poisoned public life ever since.\" Unlike other rulings that recognized new social norms and established new constitutional rights-to interracial marriage and same-sex marriage, for instance-Roe v. Wade remains vulnerable even now, nearly half a century later, to a precedent-flipping, stare-decisis-flouting new ruling. It has never been more so, in fact, than it is now. In the coming term, the conservative-majority Court has agreed to hear a case in which the state of Mississippi is essentially seeking to overturn Roe, along with Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed the right to abortion before the stage of fetal viability. Earlier this month, the Court offered a preview of its orientation when it declined to halt enforcement of an even more draconian Texas law, which bans all abortions after about six weeks, a point at which many women do not even know that they are pregnant.\n\nRoe is unusual in another respect. In most landmark cases, the plaintiff doesn't stick around like an ornery barfly at closing time, making trouble for all sides. When Jane Roe, whose real name was Norma McCorvey, became a plaintiff in one of the highest-profile cases ever to go before the Supreme Court, she was a broke, divorced, twenty-two-year-old Texan with a ninth-grade education-\"a street person, drug addict, drunk,\" as she described herself, decades later. Most of her lovers were women, but, in 1970, she was unintentionally pregnant for the third time, by a flaky married guy who was already out of the picture. She wasn't looking for a crusade when she met with the feminist lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee at a pizza parlor in Dallas; she was looking for a way to end her pregnancy. Abortion was illegal in Texas, and McCorvey was most likely too far along in her pregnancy to make it to one of the few states where it wasn't; also, she'd been scared off by a reconnaissance visit to an illegal practitioner closer to home.\n\nBy the time the Court handed down its decision in the case, McCorvey had given birth to a baby girl and relinquished her for adoption. She had also met Connie Gonzalez, her devoted partner for many years (although McCorvey cheated on her with gusto), and the two were eking out a living as housecleaners. When McCorvey got the call from Weddington and learned that she'd prevailed in the highest court, the victory didn't mean much to her. As the journalist Joshua Prager writes in \"The Family Roe: An American Story\" (Norton), his prodigiously researched, richly detailed, sensitively told account of McCorvey's strange, and very American, odyssey, \"Her own lawyers had not much cared to know her. She, in turn, had not much cared to know about their case; when, months later, Norma listed in her red plastic datebook the important events of 1973, she included the Yom Kippur War, the Texas State Fair, and the closing of a local theater, but not the lawsuit that bore her assumed name.\"\n\nMcCorvey eventually acknowledged that she was Jane Roe and, in the late nineteen-eighties and early nineties, began making appearances in the national media. She served as an ambivalent asset to the pro-choice movement, attending rallies, and telling her story-not especially truthfully, according to Prager-in a best-selling 1994 memoir, \"I Am Roe.\" The ambivalence ran both ways, and was awkwardly riven by class. McCorvey thought the pro-choice leaders were hoity-toity. They left her out of events commemorating Roe where she figured she should have been a featured speaker. She thought they wanted her to be something she wasn't-\"a demure . . . white glove lady.\" (She felt differently about the celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, who did the talk-show circuit with her for a while and brought out McCorvey's salty, extemporaneous charm.)\n\nPro-choice activists didn't really want McCorvey donning white gloves, of all things, but they did tend to see her as a loose cannon and an unreliable narrator of her own life. For years, McCorvey had told reporters that the pregnancy she'd gone to court over had been the result of a rape. When she explained, in a 1987 interview, that it was actually a consensual encounter, the revelation came as an embarrassment to the pro-choice movement. Anti-abortion activists seized on the admission, arguing that it essentially invalidated the Court's ruling. Prager quotes a letter to a Virginia newspaper from a preacher: \"As a result of McCorvey's lie, more than twenty million babies have been aborted.\" In fact, neither McCorvey's affidavit nor Blackmun's opinion mentioned anything about how she got pregnant.\n\nThen, in the mid-nineties, while McCorvey was answering phones at an abortion clinic, she met Flip Benham, a former saloonkeeper turned anti-abortion militant. Benham was a born-again-Christian lay minister who preached not only against abortion but also against homosexuality. He kind of liked Norma, though, and, more to the point, he saw in her a prize convert for his movement. Soon he was pressing a Bible into her hands, making her a business card that read \"Miss Norma, Slave for Christ,\" and baptizing her in a back-yard pool in suburban Dallas. So began McCorvey's turn as an asset to the other side in the abortion wars. The head of Texans United for Life crowed, \"The poster child has jumped off the poster.\" In time, McCorvey rebelled against Benham's insistence that she renounce her lesbianism, but she continued to cast her lot with the anti-abortion side, eventually converting to Catholicism.\n\nPrager is not unsympathetic to McCorvey, but he sees her clearly. He notes that, unlike some of her feminist allies, pro-life leaders, even though they rejected her homosexuality, \"made a public point of embracing Norma as she was-blunt and blue-collar.\" He paints a believable portrait of a woman who cared about flirting and fun, seduction and sex, attention and affirmation-\"watching out for Norma's salvation and Norma's ass,\" as she once put it-but not about ideology, or politics, or anybody else's rights, really, let alone their souls. McCorvey confided to Prager, who spent time with her at the end of her life, \"It's really a lot harder on this side because you gotta act like you care. But I don't really give a shit.\"\n\nMcCorvey died in 2017, and three years later a documentary about her, \"AKA Jane Roe,\" portrayed her as having never truly changed her mind about abortion but having been paid off to say she had. Yet, in Prager's persuasive telling, it was not so much a secret deal as a product of McCorvey's personality. It's true that in the documentary McCorvey, interviewed in a nursing home, tells the filmmaker, Nick Sweeney, \"If a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine, it's no skin off my ass.\" And when Sweeney asks if her advocacy for the pro-life side \"was all an act,\" she replies, \"Yeah. I did it well, too.\" Though the film suggests that anti-abortion activists had paid McCorvey handsomely, Prager says she made something like eight hundred dollars on average for a talk, and \"struggled to hold on to what little she earned.\" In fact, the pro-choice side had paid her for public appearances, too, but she never got rich off either movement. You don't get the impression that McCorvey was purposefully lying to activists on either side. When she decided that people were being high and mighty with her, it was enough to send her skittering back and forth across what seemed to others like profound dividing lines of conscience and belief. She just doesn't seem to have cared all that much about reproductive rights. McCorvey, speaking of her defection to the anti-abortion camp, told Prager, \"I was lonely for some excitement. I needed to do something that would cause media attention. Isn't that awful?\"\n\nPrager got an astonishing array of people to talk to him for this book-from short-term girlfriends of McCorvey's to the son of Henry Wade, the Dallas D.A. who was Roe's legal antagonist and who, we learn here, was secretly pro-choice. The book is most compelling, though, when it's relating the personal saga of a woman and her family caught in the gears of history. Prager brings in two characters beyond McCorvey's orbit-Mildred Jefferson, an African American pro-life leader, and Curtis Boyd, a doctor who provided abortions before and after Roe-but their stories don't add much to the narrative. Its drive comes from Prager's efforts to track down the three daughters whom McCorvey gave up for adoption.\n\nWhat he learns about these women doesn't cohere into a neat takeaway, although it's notable that all three tell him they are pro-choice. The oldest, who was partly raised by Norma's mother and sister, and who knew Norma, yearns for a deep family bond with her two half sisters and hopes that they'll find a way to accept their mother. The middle sister, who most resembles McCorvey and is, like her, a lesbian, is more interested in information about her biological parents than in a relationship with them. The youngest, the so-called Roe baby, was identified by a pro-life private detective shortly before her nineteenth birthday, laying the groundwork for a National Enquirer story. Until then, she had pretended that her real parents were Ann-Margret and Elvis Presley, and she tells Prager that she wishes she'd never learned the facts of her birth. The sisters' lives are ordinary, zigzagging between rough passages (depression, divorce, domestic abuse, addiction) and periods of fulfillment (going back to school, loving a job at a florist's, meeting a nice new guy or gal, embracing stay-at-home motherhood). And yet, because their biological mother happens to have been Jane Roe, they are also extraordinary. It's like a fairy tale set in working-class America, each sister carrying a secret and a curse.\n\nWould a different Jane Roe have changed the way the case has been perceived over the years? Reading \"The Family Roe,\" you wonder whether someone other than McCorvey might have been a better fit for the role, and whether she might have been served better by sidestepping it. The one thing McCorvey had wanted when she went to see the lawyers she'd been referred to was an abortion-and she never got it. Weddington and Coffee do seem to have told her that, by the time her case made it to court, it would almost certainly be too late to end the pregnancy. But they did not help her to get an abortion, and, as Prager notes, they could at least have tried. Weddington had worked with a service that referred people seeking abortions to clinics in California (where it was legal) and in Mexico (where it was quasi-legal). She herself had obtained an abortion in Mexico a few years earlier.\n\nLink copied\n\nWeddington was only twenty-six when she argued Roe in front of the Supreme Court. The prevailing atmosphere was so sexist that the Texas assistant attorney general prefaced his argument with a lame quip about the difficulty of facing off against \"such beautiful ladies.\" There is much to admire about her: she went on to win a seat in the state legislature, to write a memoir about the case, and to become a popular speaker on college campuses. But Prager says that in early interviews Weddington made it sound as if McCorvey had decided to carry her pregnancy to term to make sure she would still have standing, thereby saving the case. In fact, Prager writes, \"Norma had shown no such valor.\" Coffee gets a more sympathetic treatment, perhaps in part because Weddington declined to talk to Prager, and in part because Coffee had a much lower profile for decades. By the time Prager located her, she had been acquitted of fraud charges (after allegedly forging a client's signature) and suspended by the Texas bar a few times, when she got behind on her licensing payments. She was living quietly with her partner in a small town in East Texas, where it was not easy to be open about her gay identity. Her finances were precarious enough that she relied on a local food bank. When she was invited, with Weddington, to a pro-choice fund-raising event in 2019, the former partners in history-making hadn't seen each other in twenty-seven years.\n\nBy the time the pro-life movement took McCorvey aboard, anti-abortion activists had widened their focus from the vulnerable fetus to the woman carrying it-who, they argued, would be morally, emotionally, and physically damaged by an abortion. The purported damage ranged from regret to a constellation of woes called \"post-abortion syndrome.\" Ronald Reagan's Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was tasked with collecting evidence of P.A.S., but admitted that he couldn't find any. Evidence of routine regret was also lacking. A large-scale study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that, five years out, the vast majority of women who had undergone an abortion said it had been the right choice for them. In any case, regret is a dubious basis for policy. People regret all kinds of decisions, large and small, but we don't proactively deprive them of their decision-making agency on the chance that they might. The anti-abortion movement made McCorvey into a sad-eyed embodiment of tormenting second thoughts. Here, after all, was the very woman whose pregnancy had legalized abortion, now decrying it. But the regret McCorvey expressed time and again was about not getting an abortion-she even shared that sentiment with a reporter sent to cover her born-again baptism.\n\nThere had been other possible plaintiffs, other possible routes to the Supreme Court. As a young litigator with the A.C.L.U., Ruth Bader Ginsburg had hoped that the Court's first abortion case would be one in which she was representing a woman seeking not to have an abortion. The woman was Susan Struck, a nurse in the Air Force who became pregnant in 1970, while serving in Vietnam. The military gave her two choices: have an abortion or be immediately discharged. (Though illegal in most states, abortion was allowed on military bases.) The Supreme Court agreed to hear Struck v. Secretary of Defense, but in the meantime the Air Force, realizing that it would likely lose, overturned the policy. An opinion in the Struck case, Ginsburg believed, would have anchored the right to have an abortion-like the right not to have one-in the notion of equality. A whole class of people could not be denied equal treatment under the law simply because they were subject to the condition of pregnancy.\n\n\"The Family Roe\" tells us that Weddington and Coffee, hedging their bets against the possibility that Norma would drop out of the suit, had challenged the Texas abortion law on behalf of another plaintiff as well. Her name was Marsha King, and she was, Prager writes, \"unlike Norma in almost every way.\" A married engineer with an advanced degree in physics, King had talked openly about the importance of abortion rights ever since having a gruelling procedure herself, in Mexico. She was in ill health and didn't want to risk getting pregnant again, but, because she wasn't currently pregnant, the Texas court that heard the case found she didn't have standing. Even so, there might have been many other candidates like King. By 1970, there had been speak-outs where women came forward in public forums to talk about their own fears of unwanted pregnancy and their experiences with illegal abortionists. These were feminists attuned to the wider significance of legalizing abortion, more committed to a cause than to their own immediate self-interest.\n\nIn the years since Roe, some civil-rights lawyers seem to have sought out appealing, well-spoken clients, with a history of activism or at least developed opinions on the issue at stake. That was true, for instance, of most of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits seeking to legalize same-sex marriage, who were upstanding embodiments of respectability politics-monogamous, middle class, sometimes devotedly caring for a disabled partner. Projecting a sort of \"disdain for politics\" was often part of the package, as Cynthia Godsoe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, points out in an essay called \"Perfect Plaintiffs.\" Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the case that established same-sex marriage, told reporters, \"No one could ever accuse us of being activists. . . . We just lived our lives.\" Still, Godsoe writes, \"several had been involved in previous LGB advocacy; all were attractive candidates for careful recruitment by cause lawyers.\" A belief in the mission and the support of other people who believe in it can gird a person for a long, public fight, making things easier on the client, emotionally, and on the larger movement, politically.\n\nAnd yet a plaintiff's character or commitment doesn't necessarily matter to the outcome of the case. It was easy to love the Lovings, the plaintiffs in Loving v. Virginia (1967), which legalized interracial marriage across the country. Their lawyers could accurately present them as ordinary, apolitical rural folks, a couple who loved each other and simply wanted to live together quietly and legally. Yet, as Godsoe notes, these dream clients with the dream name came to their lawyers by \"happenstance.\" John Lawrence, of Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the landmark Supreme Court case that overturned sodomy laws, was nobody's idea of a dream plaintiff. He had displayed no interest in gay-rights activism, and he had a previous conviction for vehicular homicide. One night, the police invaded his home without a warrant and arrested him for having sex with another man. Lawrence's partner wasn't even his lover, as the law professor Dale Carpenter revealed in his book on the case, \"Flagrant Conduct.\" But arrests for sodomy in Texas were rare, so this one offered a valuable opportunity to challenge a set of assumptions behind legal anti-gay discrimination. McCorvey's main qualification, too, was being in the right place in the right condition at the right time, and being willing to sign an affidavit.\n\nThose of us who are pro-choice may be tempted to sigh over Roe v. Wade, wondering how it could have been different. Maybe, as Justice Ginsburg believed, it would have been better to ground the right to abortion in equality rather than in privacy. You can see the pitfalls of a \"my body, my choice\" absolutism-or a caricature of it-in the anti-vaccine and anti-mask movements of today. Many feminist thinkers now argue for a more inclusive, and potentially sturdier, defense of abortion rights in what's often called reproductive justice. It embraces the freedom to have children, with adequate social supports to raise them, as well as the freedom to postpone or prevent childbearing. That would mean, as Reva Siegel, a law professor at Yale, has put it, looking beyond abortion and asking, \"What are all the ways that law impinges on-empowers or disempowers-people in their intimate and their family lives?\"\n\nOn the other hand, Justice Blackmun's elaboration of a constitutional right to privacy, the assertion that there are areas of intimate life on which the state cannot encroach, has been important in subsequent decisions governing the right to marry whom one chooses, and in the understanding of human rights more generally. And the backlash argument-that it was the judicial overreach of Roe that created this country's long-lasting division over abortion-deserves at least an asterisk. There's no doubt that Roe exerted what Prager describes as a galvanizing effect on anti-abortion activists. It has been a mainstay of evangelical politics for decades, and all the more offensive to some because it could be attributed to what Antonin Scalia called \"the black-robed supremacy\" on the federal bench. Yet Siegel and Linda Greenhouse, a former Supreme Court reporter for the Times , have dug into the backlash claim and provided a set of complicating facts. Polling on the eve of Roe showed that a \"substantial majority\" of Americans favored decriminalizing abortion, including two-thirds of self-identified Republicans and fifty-six per cent of Catholics. But, they write, \"despite broad popular support, liberalization of abortion law had all but come to a halt in the face of concerted opposition by a Catholic-led minority.\" Republicans began stoking opposition to abortion as part of a strategy to lure working-class Catholic voters and Southerners who were alienated by the Democratic Party's outreach to minorities, by the counterculture, and by the women's movement. In Greenhouse and Siegel's view, there is nothing uniquely backlash-inducing about a judicial, as opposed to a legislative, extension of rights.\n\nAs for McCorvey herself, precisely because of her ambivalence she was, in significant ways, a highly representative and therefore inadvertently eloquent plaintiff. As Prager writes, \"If Norma was uncomfortable with the increasing surety and absolutism of both movements, she was hardly alone.\" By the end of her life, she occupied what she called \"the mushy middle,\" supporting, as many Americans do, abortion rights but with some limits. And the fact that she did not want to be a parent was certainly related to what Ginsburg called \"the right to control her own destiny.\" Her topsy-turvy life is a reminder, too, that if the personal is the political, the political is also the personal, driven by inconsistency and exigency.\n\nMcCorvey wanted an abortion at a time when some women could fly to California or Oregon or Mexico to get one and others could not. She simply didn't have the money. Today, more than half of those who have abortions live below the federal poverty line. And they are the ones who will suffer if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Women will always seek to end unwanted pregnancies, as they have throughout history, and throughout the world, regardless of what the law says. Indeed, doing so is easier now than ever, given the availability of reliable abortion-inducing drugs that can be taken at home and are increasingly provided by online services. People of means seeking abortions will be able to travel to states that have strengthened their own laws to make sure the procedure can still be offered there. Women short on funds, or information, or child care, or the ability to take time off from work will be out of luck and, if they do find a way to end an unwanted pregnancy, more vulnerable to prosecution. Norma McCorvey's obituary in the Washington Post ended, aptly, with something she said in 1994: \"I don't require that much in my life. I just never had the privilege to go into an abortion clinic, lay down, and have an abortion. That's the only thing I never had.\" In that way, McCorvey was the perfect plaintiff-a harbinger of things to come. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "We're Not Going Back to the Time Before Roe. We're Going Somewhere Worse\n\nIn the weeks since a draft of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization-a case about a Mississippi law that bans abortion after fifteen weeks, with some health-related exceptions but none for rape or incest- was leaked , a slogan has been revived: \"We won't go back.\" It has been chanted at marches, defiantly but also somewhat awkwardly, given that this is plainly an era of repression and regression , in which abortion rights are not the only rights disappearing. Now that the Supreme Court has issued its final decision, overturning Roe v. Wade and removing the constitutional right to abortion, insuring that abortion will become illegal or highly restricted in twenty states, the slogan sounds almost divorced from reality-an indication, perhaps, of how difficult it has become to comprehend the power and the right-wing extremism of the current Supreme Court.\n\nSupport for abortion has never been higher , with more than two-thirds of Americans in favor of retaining Roe, and fifty-seven per cent affirming a woman's right to abortion for any reason. Even so, there are Republican officials who have made it clear that they will attempt to pass a federal ban on abortion if and when they control both chambers of Congress and the Presidency. Anyone who can get pregnant must now face the reality that half of the country is in the hands of legislators who believe that your personhood and autonomy are conditional-who believe that, if you are impregnated by another person, under any circumstance, you have a legal and moral duty to undergo pregnancy, delivery, and, in all likelihood, two decades or more of caregiving, no matter the permanent and potentially devastating consequences for your body, your heart, your mind, your family, your ability to put food on the table, your plans, your aspirations, your life.\n\nNew Yorker writers answer questions about what comes next for reproductive rights .\n\n\"We won't go back\"-it's an inadequate rallying cry, prompted only by events that belie its message. But it is true in at least one sense. The future that we now inhabit will not resemble the past before Roe, when women sought out illegal abortions and not infrequently found death. The principal danger now lies elsewhere, and arguably reaches further. We have entered an era not of unsafe abortion but of widespread state surveillance and criminalization-of pregnant women, certainly, but also of doctors and pharmacists and clinic staffers and volunteers and friends and family members, of anyone who comes into meaningful contact with a pregnancy that does not end in a healthy birth. Those who argue that this decision won't actually change things much-an instinct you'll find on both sides of the political divide-are blind to the ways in which state-level anti-abortion crusades have already turned pregnancy into punishment, and the ways in which the situation is poised to become much worse.\n\nIn the states where abortion has been or will soon be banned, any pregnancy loss past an early cutoff can now potentially be investigated as a crime. Search histories, browsing histories, text messages, location data, payment data, information from period-tracking apps-prosecutors can examine all of it if they believe that the loss of a pregnancy may have been deliberate. Even if prosecutors fail to prove that an abortion took place, those who are investigated will be punished by the process, liable for whatever might be found.\n\nFive years ago, Latice Fisher, a Black mother of three from Mississippi, who made eleven dollars an hour as a police-radio operator, experienced a stillbirth, at roughly thirty-six weeks, at home. When questioned, she acknowledged that she didn't want more kids and couldn't afford to take care of more kids. She surrendered her phone to investigators, who scraped it for search data and found search terms regarding mifepristone and misoprostol, i.e., abortion pills .\n\nThese pills are among the reasons that we are not going back to the era of coat hangers. They can be prescribed via telemedicine and delivered via mail ; allowing for the prescription of an extra dose, they are ninety-five to ninety-eight per cent effective in cases of pregnancy up to eleven weeks, which account for almost ninety per cent of all abortions in the U.S. Already, more than half of all abortions in the country are medication abortions. In nineteen states, doctors are prohibited from providing abortions via telemedicine, but women can seek help from clinicians in other states and abroad , such as Rebecca Gomperts, who leads Aid Access, an organization based in Austria that is openly providing abortion pills to women in prohibition states, and has been safely mailing abortion pills to pregnant people all over the world since 2005, with the organization Women on Web. In advance of the U.S. bans, Gomperts has been promoting advance prescription : sympathetic doctors might prescribe abortion pills for any menstruating person, removing some of the fears-and, possibly, the traceability-that would come with attempting to get the pills after pregnancy. Misoprostol can be prescribed for other issues, such as stomach ulcers, and Gomperts argues that there is no reasonable medical argument against advance prescription. \"If you buy bleach in the supermarket, that's more dangerous,\" she has said.\n\nThere was no evidence that Latice Fisher took an abortion pill. She maintained that she had experienced a stillbirth-an occurrence in one out of every hundred and sixty pregnancies in the U.S. Nonetheless, she was charged with second-degree murder and held for several weeks on a hundred-thousand-dollar bond. The district attorney, Scott Colom, had campaigned as a progressive reformer; advocates pushed him to drop the murder charge, and to provide a new grand jury with information about an antiquated, unreliable \"float test\" that had been used as a basis for the allegation that Fisher's baby was born alive. The grand jury declined to indict Fisher again; the ordeal took more than three years.\n\nEven if it remains possible in prohibition states to order abortion pills, doing so will be unlawful. (Missouri recently proposed classifying the delivery or shipment of these pills as drug trafficking . Louisiana just passed a law that makes mailing abortion pills to a resident of the state a criminal offense, punishable by six months' imprisonment.) In many states, to avoid breaking the law, a woman would have to drive to a state where abortion is legal, have a telemedicine consultation there, and then receive the pills in that state. Many women in Texas have opted for a riskier but easier option: to drive across the border , to Mexico, and get abortion pills from unregulated pharmacies, where pharmacists may issue incorrect advice for usage. Some women who lack the freedom and money to travel out of state, and who might fear the consequences of seeking a clinical confirmation of their gestational stage, will order abortion pills without a clear understanding of how far along they are in pregnancy. Abortion pills are safe and effective, but patients need access to clinical guidance and follow-up care. Women in prohibition states who want to seek medical attention after a self-managed abortion will, as a rule, have to choose between risking their freedom and risking their health.\n\nBoth abortion and miscarriage currently occur more than a million times each year in America, and the two events are often clinically indistinguishable . Because of this, prohibition states will have a profoundly invasive interest in differentiating between them. Some have already laid the groundwork for establishing government databases of pregnant women likely to seek abortions. Last year, Arkansas passed a law called the Every Mom Matters Act , which requires women considering abortion to call a state hotline and requires abortion providers to register all patients in a database with a unique I.D. Since then, six other states have implemented or proposed similar laws. The hotlines are provided by crisis pregnancy centers : typically Christian organizations, many of which masquerade as abortion clinics, provide no health care, and passionately counsel women against abortion. Crisis pregnancy centers are already three times as numerous as abortion clinics in the U.S., and, unlike hospitals, they are not required to protect the privacy of those who come to them. For years, conservative states have been redirecting money , often from funds earmarked for poor women and children, toward these organizations. The data that crisis pregnancy centers are capable of collecting-names, locations, family details, sexual and medical histories, non-diagnostic ultrasound images-can now be deployed against those who seek their help.\n\nIf you become pregnant, your phone generally knows before many of your friends do. The entire Internet economy is built on meticulous user tracking of purchases and search terms. Laws modelled on Texas's S.B. 8 , which encourages private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who facilitates an abortion, will proliferate, giving self-appointed vigilantes no shortage of tools to track and identify suspects. (The National Right to Life Committee recently published policy recommendations for anti-abortion states that included criminal penalties for anyone who provides information about self-managed abortion \"over the telephone, the internet, or any other medium of communication.\") A reporter for Vice recently spent a mere hundred and sixty dollars to purchase a data set on visits to more than six hundred Planned Parenthood clinics. Brokers sell data that make it possible to track journeys to and from any location-say, an abortion clinic in another state. In Missouri, this year, a lawmaker proposed a measure that would allow private citizens to sue anyone who helps a resident of the state get an abortion elsewhere; as with S.B. 8, the law would reward successful plaintiffs with ten thousand dollars. The closest analogue to this kind of legislation is the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793.\n\nFor now, the targets of S.B. 8-type bounty laws are those who provide abortions, not those who seek them. But that seems likely to change. Connecticut, a progressive state on the matter of abortion, recently passed a law that prevents local agencies from coöperating with out-of-state abortion prosecutions and protects the medical records of out-of-state clients. Other progressive states will follow suit. If prohibition states can't sue out-of-state doctors, and, if abortion pills sent by mail remain largely undetectable, the only people left to target will be abortion advocates and those trying to get abortions. The Stream, a conservative Christian publication, recently advocated mandatory psychiatric custody for women who get abortions. In May, Louisiana advanced a bill that would allow abortion patients to be charged with murder. The proposal was withdrawn, but the threat had been made.\n\nThe theological concept of fetal personhood-the idea that, from the moment of conception, an embryo or fetus is a full human being, deserving of equal (or, more accurately, superior) rights-is a foundational doctrine of the anti-abortion movement. The legal ramifications of this idea -including the possible classification of I.V.F., IUDs, and the morning-after pill as instruments of murder-are unhinged , and much harsher than what even the average anti-abortion American is currently willing to embrace. Nonetheless, the anti-abortion movement is now openly pushing for fetal personhood to become the foundation of U.S. abortion law.\n\nIf a fetus is a person, then a legal framework can be invented to require someone who has one living inside her to do everything in her power to protect it, including-as happened to Savita Halappanavar , in Ireland, which operated under a fetal-personhood doctrine until 2018, and to Izabela Sajbor, in Poland, where all abortion is effectively illegal-to die. No other such obligation exists anywhere in our society, which grants cops the freedom to stand by as children are murdered behind an unlocked door. In Poland, pregnant women with cancer have been routinely denied chemotherapy because of clinicians' fears of harming the fetus.\n\nFetal-personhood laws have passed in Georgia and Alabama, and they are no longer likely to be found unconstitutional. Such laws justify a full-scale criminalization of pregnancy, whereby women can be arrested, detained, and otherwise placed under state intervention for taking actions perceived to be potentially harmful to a fetus. This approach has been steadily tested, on low-income minorities in particular, for the past four decades. National Advocates for Pregnant Women-the organization that has provided legal defense for most of the cases mentioned in this article-has documented almost eighteen hundred cases, from 1973 to 2020, of prosecutions or forced interventions related to pregnancy; this is likely a substantial undercount. Even in states such as California, where the law explicitly prohibits charging women with murder after a pregnancy loss, conservative prosecutors are doing so anyway .\n\nMost pregnancy-related prosecutions, so far, have revolved around drug use. Women who used drugs while pregnant, or sought treatment for drug use during pregnancy, have been charged with child abuse, child neglect, distribution of drugs to a minor, assault with a deadly weapon, manslaughter, and homicide. In 2020, law enforcement in Alabama investigated a woman named Kim Blalock for chemical endangerment of a child after she told delivery-room staff that she had been taking prescribed hydrocodone for pain management. (The district attorney charged her with prescription fraud-a felony-before eventually dropping the prosecution altogether.) There has been a string of shocking recent prosecutions in Oklahoma, in which women who used drugs have been charged with manslaughter for miscarrying well before the point of viability. In Wisconsin, state law already allows juvenile courts to take a fetus-meaning a pregnant woman-into custody for the fetus's protection, resulting in the detention and forced treatment of more than four hundred pregnant women every year on the suspicion that they may be consuming controlled substances. A proposed law in Wyoming would create a specific category of felony child endangerment for drug use while pregnant, a law that resembles Tennessee's former Fetal Assault Law. The Tennessee law was discontinued after two years, because treating women as adversaries to the fetuses they carry has a chilling effect on prenatal medicine, and inevitably results in an increase in maternal and infant death.\n\nThe mainstream pro-choice movement has largely ignored the growing criminalization of pregnancy, just as it has generally ignored the inadequacy of Roe. (It took Joe Biden, who campaigned on making Roe the \"law of the land,\" more than a year to say the word \"abortion\" on the record after he became President; the Democrats, given the chance to override the filibuster and codify Roe in May, predictably failed to do so.) Many of those who support the right to abortion have tacitly accepted that poor and minority women in conservative states lost access to abortion long before this Supreme Court decision, and have quietly hoped that the thousands of women facing arrest after pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or even healthy deliveries were unfortunate outliers. They were not outliers, and, as the columnist Rebecca Traister noted last month, the chasm between the impervious class and everyone else is growing every day.\n\nPregnancy is more than thirty times more dangerous than abortion. One study estimates that a nationwide ban would lead to a twenty-one-per-cent rise in pregnancy-related deaths. Some of the women who will die from abortion bans are pregnant right now. Their deaths will come not from back-alley procedures but from a silent denial of care: interventions delayed, desires disregarded. They will die of infections, of preëclampsia, of hemorrhage, as they are forced to submit their bodies to pregnancies that they never wanted to carry, and it will not be hard for the anti-abortion movement to accept these deaths as a tragic, even noble, consequence of womanhood itself.\n\nIn the meantime, abortion bans will hurt, disable, and endanger many people who want to carry their pregnancies to term but who encounter medical difficulties. Physicians in prohibition states have already begun declining to treat women who are in the midst of miscarriages, for fear that the treatment could be classified as abortion. One woman in Texas was told that she had to drive fifteen hours to New Mexico to have her ectopic pregnancy-which is nonviable, by definition, and always dangerous to the mother-removed. Misoprostol, one of the abortion pills, is routinely prescribed for miscarriage management, because it causes the uterus to expel any remaining tissue. Pharmacists in Texas, fearing legal liability, have already refused to prescribe it . If a miscarriage is not managed to a safe completion, women risk-among other things, and taking the emotional damage for granted-uterine perforation, organ failure, infection, infertility, and death.\n\nMost miscarriages are caused by factors beyond a pregnant person's control: illnesses, placental or uterine irregularities, genetic abnormalities. But the treatment of pregnant people in this country already makes many of them feel directly and solely responsible for the survival of their fetus. They are told to absolutely avoid alcohol, coffee, retinol, deli turkey, unpasteurized cheese, hot baths, vigorous exercise, drugs that are not prescribed to them, drugs that they have been prescribed for years-often without any explanation of the frequently shoddy reasoning behind these prohibitions. Structural factors that clearly increase the likelihood of miscarriage-poverty, environmental-chemical exposure, working night shifts-are less likely to come up. As fetal personhood becomes law in more of the land, pregnant people, as Lynn Paltrow, the director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, has pointed out , \"could be sued, or prevented from engaging in travel, work, or any activity that is believed to create a risk to the life of the unborn.\"\n\nHalf a century ago, the anti-abortion movement was dominated by progressive, antiwar, pro-welfare Catholics. Today, the movement is conservative, evangelical, and absolutely single-minded , populated overwhelmingly by people who, although they may embrace foster care, adoption, and various forms of private ministry, show no interest in pushing for public, structural support for human life once it's left the womb. The scholar Mary Ziegler recently noted that today's anti-abortion advocates see the \"strategies of earlier decades as apologetic, cowardly, and counterproductive.\" During the past four years, eleven states have passed abortion bans that contain no exceptions for rape or incest, a previously unthinkable extreme.\n\nIn Texas, already, children aged nine, ten, and eleven , who don't yet understand what sex and abuse are, face forced pregnancy and childbirth after being raped. Women sitting in emergency rooms in the midst of miscarriages are being denied treatment for sepsis because their fetuses' hearts haven't yet stopped. People you'll never hear of will spend the rest of their lives trying and failing, agonizingly, in this punitive country , to provide stability for a first or fifth child they knew they weren't equipped to care for.\n\nIn the face of all this, there has been so much squeamishness, even in the pro-choice camp: a tone that casts abortion as an unfortunate necessity; an approach to messaging which values choice but devalues abortion care itself, which emphasizes reproductive rights rather than reproductive justice. That approach has landed us here. We are not going back to the pre-Roe era, and we should not want to go back to the era that succeeded it, which was less bitter than the present but was never good enough. We should demand more, and we will have to. We will need to be full-throated and unconditional about abortion as a necessary precondition to justice and equal rights if we want even a chance of someday getting somewhere better. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article inaccurately described aspects of the legal process concerning Latice Fisher's case.\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The End of Roe v. Wade: What You Need to Know About Abortion Access\n\nThis piece originally appeared in our Daily newsletter. Sign up to receive the best of The New Yorker every day in your in-box.\n\nIn a decision in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade , which established a constitutional right to abortion, in 1973. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, echoed a draft that was leaked at the beginning of May.\n\nThe ruling is expected to create a stark divide within the country, with residents of more liberal states retaining the right to abortion and those in conservative states largely losing it. Abortion will be immediately illegal or severely restricted in as many as twenty states, affecting an estimated twenty-five million women of childbearing age. Twenty states-along with the District of Columbia-where roughly twenty-six million women of reproductive age reside, will continue to protect abortion rights.\n\nThe ruling is also expected to profoundly affect public perceptions of the Supreme Court. Opinion polls show that a majority of Americans oppose the overturning of Roe. It will also spark an intense political battle, as Democrats push to make the decision a central issue in the midterm elections . The decision could also kick off further political activism from the right. The ruling marks \"the culmination of a half-century-long legal campaign singularly focussed on that outcome,\" the law professor and New Yorker contributor Jeannie Suk Gersen writes. \"And there are signs that, far from being an end in itself, it would launch even more ambitious agendas.\"\n\nWhat will the future of reproductive rights in the United States look like, and what will the political impact of the decision be? Our writers offer answers to urgent questions following today's ruling.\n\nHow will people in states where abortion is outlawed seek care?\n\nEven before the end of Roe, people have been forced to travel significant distances to obtain care. Stephania Taladrid follows the arduous and expensive journey of a fourteen-year-old girl named Laura , who, because of the Texas Heartbeat Act, is forced to travel seven hundred miles with her family from Dallas to New Mexico, to visit what is likely to become among the last remaining abortion clinics in the Southwest. In a dispatch from Illinois, which has been a safe harbor for abortion, Peter Slevin writes about health centers rushing to accomodate a growing number of medical migrants, or \"abortion refugees.\" And although abortion pills, which can be prescribed by phone or video, offer a path for people who can't travel, several states have already imposed restrictions on them.\n\nWhat will conservative activists target next?\n\nJeannie Suk Gersen writes that the overturning of Roe will \"almost certainly fuel the broader fight to get fundamental moral issues out of the realm of federal constitutional rights and under the control of the states.\" This effort might target same-sex marriage and other L.G.B.T.Q. rights, contraception, and more.\n\nWhy were Alito and his fellow-originalists unable to find any legal basis for abortion in the Constitution?\n\nThe \"opinion rests almost exclusively on a bizarre and impoverished historical analysis,\" Jill Lepore notes . It's not just abortion that the Constitution fails to consider. \"There is nothing in that document-or in the circumstances under which it was written-that suggests its authors imagined women as part of the political community embraced by the phrase 'We the People,' \" Lepore writes, and adds that, \"to use a history of discrimination to deny people their constitutional rights is a perversion of logic and a betrayal of justice.\"\n\nHow did the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, get to this point?\n\n\"Since originalists maintain that a right to abortion can't be inferred from the Constitution, the goals of an originalist and an opponent of legal abortion often dovetail conveniently,\" Margaret Talbot writes , in a profile of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose \"personal views on abortion are no mystery.\" In 2006, Barrett \"signed her name to a newspaper ad that declared it 'time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.' \" And in December, 2021, during oral hearings for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Barrett's questioning focussed on whether abortion was necessary, given \"safe haven\" laws that allow a person who has just given birth to leave the baby at a fire station or another designated spot.\n\nWhat are other possible collateral effects of the decision?\n\n\"Every year, there are about a million miscarriages in the United States. Under the doctrine of fetal personhood, these common, complicated, and profoundly intimate losses could become legally subject to surveillance and criminalization,\" Jia Tolentino writes , about how overturning Roe may strengthen the fight by anti-abortion groups for fetal personhood on the state and federal levels.\n\nWho will decide whether the \"life of the mother\" is threatened?\n\nTwenty-six states are likely to criminalize abortion, and as many as twenty-two states are likely to enforce felony bans, Jessica Winter writes . These typically include a \"life of the mother\" exception, but the language of these exceptions varies, and questions such as \"What constitutes an 'emergency'? How does one define 'substantial' or 'reasonable'?\" are left unanswered. As one doctor says, \"Do I have to watch the patient bleed to death? Do I have to call a lawyer before I save her life?\"\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Next Targets for the Group That Overturned Roe\n\nOn March 15, 2023, two conservative Christian lawyers asked a federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, for a ruling that they privately considered an almost impossible long shot. They demanded a nationwide ban on mifepristone, a pill used in half the abortions in America. The drug had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for more than twenty years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During the pandemic, the agency began allowing prescriptions to be filled by mail, to accommodate social distancing.\n\nBut the lawyers, from a group called Alliance Defending Freedom, were on a winning streak. Founded three decades ago as a legal-defense fund for conservative Christian causes, A.D.F. had become that movement's most influential arm. In the past dozen years, its lawyers had won fourteen Supreme Court victories, including overturning Roe v. Wade; allowing employer-sponsored health insurance to exclude birth control; rolling back limits on government support for religious organizations; protecting the anonymity of donors to advocacy groups; blocking pandemic-related public-health rules; and establishing the right of a baker to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Capitalizing on its success, A.D.F. had tripled its revenue over that period, to more than a hundred million dollars a year. It now had seventy or so in-house lawyers, including the former solicitors general of Michigan and Nebraska and the former United States Attorney for Missouri. The lawyers sent to Amarillo were Erik Baptist, a former top lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump, and Erin Hawley, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, advised the Attorney General under President George W. Bush, and worked on the team that overturned Roe. (She is married to Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri.)\n\nThanks to the rightward shift of the courts under Trump, A.D.F. lawyers now often find a sympathetic audience on the federal bench. Filing the mifepristone case in Amarillo enabled A.D.F. to argue before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who had previously worked as the deputy general counsel of First Liberty Institute-a conservative Christian advocacy organization that has received grants from A.D.F. The summer before, Kacsmaryk's chambers had chosen an intern from an A.D.F. program for law students; an alumnus of the program is clerking for him this fall. (Other alumni clerked last term for Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Amy Coney Barrett.)\n\nMany of the sixty-odd members of A.D.F.'s fund-raising department gathered during the hearing to pray for a win, and, in a video conference the next day, Lance Bauslaugh, A.D.F.'s senior vice-president of development, told the staff that Erin Hawley was \"super grateful.\" Even though the Amarillo judge was \"very friendly,\" Bauslaugh said, upending a decades-old F.D.A. approval was \"a tough thing to do.\" He said of the judge, \"Maybe he gives us half of what we are seeking\"-say, restoring limits on mail-order delivery. That alone would be \"huge.\" (A left-leaning investigative organization called Documented provided me with leaked recordings of the video conference and other events, along with hundreds of pages of internal documents.)\n\nThe hearing itself, Bauslaugh noted, offered \"fund-raising opportunities.\" Donations had been flat lately; Bauslaugh blamed the economy, but surely the reversal of Roe had sapped some donors' motivation. The mifepristone case was plunging A.D.F. back into a galvanizing battle. One of Bauslaugh's lieutenants offered a potential fund-raising pitch: \"If I told you five years ago that you could have invested in Roe being overturned, how much would you have invested in that? If I can tell you now that we are going to protect life even more, how much do you want to invest in that ?\"\n\nBauslaugh framed the case yet more broadly, beyond abortion or even Christianity. Calling it \"a massive pushback on the F.D.A. and the Biden Administration from a regulatory standpoint,\" he noted that there was \"a ton of corruption in the bureaucratic state.\"\n\nIn fact, he explained, A.D.F. was quietly revising its mission altogether, to reflect both the changing times and the group's growing ambitions. Until now, A.D.F. had cast itself as primarily defensive. In the words of one of its founders, its purpose was \"to keep the door open for the Gospel\": to prevent the American Civil Liberties Union and the courts from interfering with Christian ministry, to stop them from removing abortion from the jurisdiction of legislatures, and to keep religion in public life. But A.D.F. leaders often said that the Bible wasn't just for the faithful; it was a universal guide to \"human flourishing.\" Accordingly, Bauslaugh told the fund-raisers, A.D.F. was taking on less explicitly religious concerns, perhaps including \"corruption in the bureaucratic state.\"\n\nAs though to reassure the staff that A.D.F. wasn't abandoning its roots, Bauslaugh kept inserting Biblical references into his explanation. \"Why do we exist as an organization?\" he asked. \"A.D.F. exists to advance our God-given rights to live and speak the truth.\" He paused to let that sink in before adding, \"The truth-the Gospel.\"\n\nFor more than half a century, conservative Christians have decried the left's ever-expanding demands for personal rights. The right to free speech allowed pornography to permeate the culture. The right to freedom of conscience for atheists and religious minorities silenced school prayer. And the right to privacy was stretched to protect birth control, abortion, gay sex, and, eventually, same-sex marriage. In an influential book from 1991, \" Rights Talk ,\" Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor and a conservative Catholic, argued that letting debates over values become all-or-nothing contests about fundamental rights was undermining democracy, by \"turning American political discourse into a parody of itself and challenging the very notion that politics can be conducted through reasoned discussion and compromise.\" Rights talk had become dangerously polarizing.\n\nYet A.D.F. now gushes \"rights talk.\" In fact, Kristen Waggoner, its chief executive and general counsel, sometimes sounds as if she worked for her organization's nemesis, the A.C.L.U. Arguing before the Supreme Court last winter, she told the Justices that she'd come to defend a bedrock First Amendment principle: the right to resist government attempts to coerce a citizen into publicly denying her deepest convictions. She said that she was standing up for a Black sculptor's right to refuse to fabricate a cross for an \"Aryan church rally,\" and for an L.G.B.T. Web designer's right not to promote \"a view of marriage that they don't hold.\" Otherwise, she avoided bringing up sexual orientation or marriage-aside from acknowledging, almost in passing, that her client, Lorie Smith, the owner of 303 Creative, a design studio in Littleton, Colorado, had preëmptively declared that she'd never design a Web site for a same-sex wedding, because such a union \"contradicts\" Scripture.\n\nThe A.D.F. lawyers who filed the mifepristone suit had likewise said that they were arguing for the right to freedom of conscience: their clients were \"pro-life\" doctors in Texas who felt \"complicit\" in a patient's \"elective chemical abortion.\" Emphasizing those rights, the judge surprised the A.D.F. lawyers by granting all their demands, including the unprecedented judicial suspension of a long-standing F.D.A. approval. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal, and A.D.F. lawyers will likely appear there soon to defend the ruling.\n\nLink copied\n\nWeeks after A.D.F.'s stunning victory in Texas, the Supreme Court found that the Web-site designer's right to free speech overrode a Colorado law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The majority opinion, by Justice Neil Gorsuch, quoted George Orwell's axiom that liberty entails \"the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\"-in this case, to tell a couple that their marriage is sinful.\n\nThough it was A.D.F.'s fifteenth Court victory, Waggoner told me that, aside from overturning Roe, Gorsuch's opinion was \"bigger than anything\" her group had yet achieved. She teared up as she praised the Court's commitment to protecting unpopular speech \"even right now, even in this moment\"-the era of cancel culture.\n\nA.D.F.'s liberal critics invoke Orwell, too. They say that the group's \"rights talk\" is doublespeak for bigotry, patriarchy, and discrimination. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at U.C. Berkeley, told me that A.D.F. \"puts freedom to discriminate over freedom from discrimination.\" Sarah Warbelow, the head of legal advocacy for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay-rights group, told me that A.D.F. was \"hellbent on eradicating L.G.B.T.Q. people from public life.\" A.D.F. is currently asking the Supreme Court to hear its defense of a Christian psychotherapist's right to counsel children and adolescents about how to overcome same-sex attraction-a practice, which L.G.B.T. advocates call \"conversion therapy,\" that many states have outlawed. In 2003, A.D.F. filed an unsuccessful brief to the Court defending the criminalization of gay sodomy, and since then its international affiliates have defended similar laws outside the U.S. (An A.D.F. spokesperson said that, as a matter of policy, its affiliates do not litigate to criminalize gay sex; they argue only against the authority of international organizations to impose moral norms on sovereign states.)\n\nOthers accuse A.D.F. of inventing grievances to blow up into causes. Smith, of 303 Creative, told me that her pastor had directed her to speak with A.D.F. before she even entered the business of making Web sites for weddings. And A.D.F. routinely sends out bulletins urging churches and ministries to be on the lookout for \" SOGI s\"-prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. An A.D.F. legal guide warns churches that such prohibitions \"are not designed for the innocent purpose of ensuring all people receive basic services\"; rather, \"their practical effect is to legally compel Christians to accept, endorse, and even promote messages, ideas, and events that violate their faith.\" A.D.F. sometimes resembles a culture-war personal-injury firm; it even solicits clients with a catchy toll-free number, 1-800- TELL-ADF .\n\nThe group has also led the charge against school policies and medical treatments meant to support children or adolescents identifying as transgender. Waggoner told me that, in 2019, A.D.F. initiated the first significant suit opposing the participation of trans athletes in girls' sporting competitions; the case, still ongoing, has helped spark a wider backlash. A.D.F.-which in 2016 established an influence operation aimed at state lawmakers and last year added one focussed on Congress-has helped at least twenty-three states pass legislation barring trans athletes from girls' and women's events. Several states have introduced A.D.F. model legislation requiring schools to get parental consent for any lessons about gender identity; a lawyer affiliated with A.D.F. helped draft a Florida measure that L.G.B.T. advocates call the \"Don't Say Gay\" law. Other states have adopted A.D.F.-drafted legislation restricting gender-transition medical treatment for minors. The organization's lawyers are now representing West Virginia in defending a law, written by A.D.F., that bans trans athletes. (In an internal briefing, the head of its legislative effort said that A.D.F. had \"authored\" at least a hundred and thirty bills in thirty-four states last year; more than thirty were passed into law. In 2018, the organization's lawyers drafted a Mississippi law banning most abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy; last year, A.D.F. successfully defended that law in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe.)\n\nWith only 1.4 per cent of adolescents in the U.S. identifying as transgender, L.G.B.T.-rights groups accuse A.D.F. of whipping up a panic over questions better left to doctors, teachers, and parents. Waggoner, though, told me that A.D.F. was merely reacting to an ominous turn in American life. Her group, she said, had been inundated by complaints from parents about liberal policies regarding trans issues, many of them asking, \"I just learned from the school district that they're calling my daughter by a different name-what can I do?\"\n\nThrough pronoun policies, anti-discrimination statutes, abortion laws, and other impositions of \"sexual ethics,\" Waggoner said, liberal government officials were threatening to set up a new kind of police state-one in which dissenters who believe that marriage can involve only a man and a woman are forced to salute the rainbow flags flying outside every town hall, in which teachers are required to indoctrinate children into the belief that gender is not binary, and in which shelters for battered women must make room for trans females. No wonder that her \"rights talk\" evokes the civil libertarians who once defended the free speech of Communists or neo-Nazis. As Waggoner sees it, traditionalist Christians are now the besieged minority in need of protection. Waggoner told me that the fundamental question was \"Are we going to be a majoritarian-authoritarian system of government? Or are we going to stick with our commitment that the power of persuasion is better than the power of government force?\" She added, \"I would say every single team at A.D.F.-every single litigation team that we have-is working against government censorship.\"\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom was born out of frustration. In 1992, Republicans had held the White House for the previous twelve years. For the first time, Christian conservatives had played a significant role in electing those Presidents, who had installed five of the nine Supreme Court Justices. Nonetheless, the Court that year reaffirmed the right to abortion, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and redoubled the separation of church and state, in Lee v. Weisman, which forbade prayer at school-sponsored events. No matter how many elections conservatives won, liberals always seemed to come out ahead in the courts. So the next year a group of prominent evangelicals-led by James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family-decided to create an endowment to pay for lawyers who could take on the A.C.L.U. and its ilk. They called it Alliance Defense Fund.\n\nTo run it, Dobson and the others turned to Alan Sears, a former federal prosecutor from Kentucky who had risen to prominence as the executive director of a commission on pornography set up during the Reagan Administration. Sears, then in his thirties, had used his platform to urge citizens to help fight the culture wars. With a soft Southern voice, he emphasized in interviews that a chapter of the commission's report laid out how \"citizen action\"-boycotts, picket lines, zoning-board changes-could limit distribution of offensive material, even if it was protected by the First Amendment. \"It's a manual that explains First Amendment rights for both sides,\" Sears explained.\n\nA handful of legal organizations specialized in either religious freedom or Christian cases, but most were run by a single lawyer without enough financial resources for a long-term strategy. A.D.F. would be different: it would begin by raising money and then enlist lawyers. Sears dedicated his life to fund-raising so completely, he told me, that he came to empathize with panhandlers: \"I had a suit, not a sign, but I learned to beg.\"\n\nHe told donors that A.D.F. would follow the litigation strategy of the Black civil-rights movement. Where Thurgood Marshall and the N.A.A.C.P. had set out to overturn the precedents underpinning racial segregation, A.D.F. aimed to undo Roe v. Wade and Lemon v. Kurtzman, the 1971 precedent barring \"excessive entanglement\" of government with religion. Like the N.A.A.C.P., A.D.F. would find sympathetic and strategically placed plaintiffs, then seek conflicting rulings from different circuits in order to push the Supreme Court to take up a question. Along the way, A.D.F. would try to erode precedents that it opposed-for example, by supporting parental-notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.\n\nA.D.F. officials declined to tell me who its donors are, but others in conservative Christian circles told me that one of the group's mainstays is the family of David Green, which founded the Hobby Lobby crafts chain and the Museum of the Bible, in Washington, D.C. The museum often hosts events for A.D.F., sometimes with speeches by Green family members, and A.D.F. lawyers argued on Hobby Lobby's side of a 2014 Supreme Court case that ended the contraception mandate for employer-sponsored insurance. (Representatives of Hobby Lobby and the museum didn't return calls seeking comment.) Foundations set up by the conservative DeVos and Prince families have also reportedly donated.\n\nCompared with other legal outfits, A.D.F. immediately stood out for the breadth of its aspirations. In 1997, years before Sears could afford in-house litigators, he began sponsoring weeklong conferences around the country to teach lawyers about the group's issues. The attendees formed an expanding network that A.D.F. could call on to provide pro-bono counsel or to help identify promising plaintiffs.\n\nIn 2001, A.D.F. started hiring in-house lawyers and representing its own clients. But Sears continued to give grants to other organizations and firms-even those competing for the same cases. This largesse helped the organization become a hub for conservative Christian donors-they could give to A.D.F. and trust that their money would be spread across the legal battlefield. Sears, who retired in 2017, told me, \"The concept of enabling our allies-we did not do it to raise money, but it really worked.\"\n\nAny interest group raises money more easily when there's a looming threat, and Sears found a perfect villain in the emboldened gay-rights movement. In 2000, Vermont recognized same-sex civil unions, and three years later the Supreme Court found a right to engage in gay sodomy. Sears made fighting gay rights A.D.F.'s third priority, alongside opposing abortion rights and church-state separation. Its lawyers contested the recognition of same-sex marriage in state after state. A.D.F. defended the military's so-called Don't Ask, Don't Tell rule, opposed school speech codes aimed at protecting gay people, helped defend a state-funded Baptist youth center in Kentucky that fired a lesbian therapist, and represented chaplains at a Minnesota women's prison who condemned lesbianism.\n\nIn 2003, when Christian conservatives were pushing state ballot measures and a constitutional amendment to block same-sex marriage, Sears published an anti-gay polemic, \" The Homosexual Agenda .\" Writing with Craig Osten, an A.D.F. communications staffer, Sears professed \"compassion and sensitivity for those ensnared in homosexual behavior,\" but characterized such behavior as a \"disordered,\" pitiable \"condition.\" Sears repeatedly linked homosexuality both to sexually transmitted disease and to the sexual abuse of children. The book relied heavily on a handful of men and women who testified that Christian faith had helped them \"escape\" same-sex attraction. Almost all of those \"ex-gay\" exemplars have since resumed gay or lesbian lives, denouncing conversion therapy and apologizing for promoting it.\n\nIf Sears were writing \"The Homosexual Agenda\" now, he told me, he'd have to make some updates. But he stood by the book's portrait of a plot, hatched by gay-rights activists, to use Hollywood, schools, and the courts to transform American culture. He had sent a lawyer to attend a major L.G.B.T.-activist conference in London, and he had studied gay-rights manifestos like \" After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90's ,\" by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen. Sears said that such activists \"told us what they wanted to do-they said, 'Let's adopt the strategy of the civil-rights movement, let's call ourselves a minority, let's call ourselves oppressed, blah blah blah blah.' \" In hindsight, he said, his book still \"stands pretty well,\" especially the claim of its subtitle-that L.G.B.T. rights are \"the principal threat to religious freedom today.\"\n\nSears was determined to prevent A.D.F. from capitulating to the language of the gay-rights movement. In 2000, he created a summer program, the Blackstone Legal Fellowship, which taught first-year law students conservative Christian thought. The organization sent visiting Blackstone lecturers a \"lexicon,\" which all participants at A.D.F. events were expected to follow. A seven-page version sent out in 2013 included the following:\n\ninstead of \"bigotry, anti-tolerance,\" say \"defending biblical, religious principles\"\n\ninstead of \"homophobia,\" say \"convictions against homosexual behavior\"\n\ninstead of \"hate crimes,\" say \"so-called 'hate' crimes\"\n\ninstead of \"sex education,\" say \"sexual indoctrination\"\n\ninstead of \"gay marriage\" and its \"advocates,\" say \"marriage imitation\" and \"opponents of marriage\"\n\ninstead of \"transgender,\" say \"cross-dressing\" or \"sexually confused\"\n\ninstead of \"gay and lesbian civil rights movement,\" say \"homosexual agenda.\"\n\nOne Blackstone lecturer that summer was Josh Hawley, a law professor from the University of Missouri and the future senator. He received a twenty-five-hundred-dollar stipend. The Riverfront Times , an alternative weekly, used freedom-of-information laws to obtain e-mail correspondence between Hawley and A.D.F., including the lexicon. A spokesperson for the Senator told the publication that he and his wife \"aren't going to apologize for their faith.\"\n\nAnother lecturer that year was Amy Coney Barrett, then a law professor at Notre Dame. She lectured at the program for five summers and received the same lexicon. Yet, during Senate hearings for her 2017 confirmation to an appeals court, she testified that she \"actually wasn't aware\" that A.D.F. had run the program \"until I received the honorarium and saw the A.D.F. on the check, or maybe when I saw an e-mail and saw the signature line.\" She added, implausibly, \"I don't know what all of A.D.F.'s policy positions are. And it has never been my practice to investigate all of the policy positions of a group that invites me to speak.\"\n\nSears's organization, which was renamed the Alliance Defending Freedom in 2012, now has forty-nine hundred lawyers in its network of allies. A.D.F. recruits graduates of Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, and more than half its staff lawyers have done federal clerkships. The Blackstone program, which began with about two dozen students, included nearly two hundred this past summer.\n\nA growing number of Blackstone alumni have clerked for federal judges, and, inevitably, their terms as clerks sometimes have included A.D.F. cases. More than sixty Blackstone alumni are currently clerking on federal courts, including eighteen on appeals courts. The alumnus who is now clerking for the federal district court in Amarillo will next year clerk for the circuit court based in Atlanta, where A.D.F. is defending an Alabama ban on gender-transition treatment for minors. And the two alumni who clerked for Barrett and Alito last session helped them weigh both the 303 Creative case and a Justice Department request to stay the mifepristone ban. (The Court granted the stay-mifepristone remains available for now-but Alito wrote a memorably vituperative dissent.)\n\nLink copied\n\nBarrett's arrival on the Court has locked in a 6-3 conservative majority, and both of Sears's original targets are dead: Roe v. Wade and Lemon v. Kurtzman, the case about enforcing church-state separation. A.D.F. hollowed out Lemon with a series of Supreme Court victories, including one allowing a town council in upstate New York to pray before meetings (2014) and another requiring the State of Missouri to pay to upgrade a Lutheran church's playground (2017). Last year, the Court cited those precedents when it ruled that a public-school football coach in Washington State could lead prayers from the fifty-yard line.\n\nThe group has become so mainstream that last fall, on Capitol Hill, Waggoner teamed up with two prominent Republican congressmen-Jim Jordan, of Ohio, and Steve Scalise, of Louisiana-to host an A.D.F. reception for newly elected lawmakers. The head of A.D.F.'s state-legislative division, J. D. Mesnard, is a state senator in Arizona. And, earlier this year, two federal judges resolved lawsuits in part by ordering litigants to submit to A.D.F. training in the First Amendment-in one case, an hour-long lecture by two A.D.F. lawyers about freedom of expression, from John Stuart Mill through the Red Scare. Three art-therapy professors at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville underwent the training to settle a suit charging that they had discriminated against a conservative Christian student by telling her to stop sharing her beliefs. And a judge in Texas ordered lawyers for Southwest Airlines to receive A.D.F. training as part of the settlement of a suit by a flight attendant who claimed she'd been fired for her opposition to abortion. (Southwest is appealing.)\n\nStill, despite A.D.F.'s many successes, same-sex couples now have a constitutional right to marry. I wondered whether Sears thought A.D.F. was winning or losing. \"We are on a winning trajectory,\" he told me, adding wishfully, \"It may be that the day will come when people say the birth-control pill was a mistake.\"\n\nThe headquarters of A.D.F. is in a leafy campus in Lansdowne, Virginia, about an hour's drive from the Supreme Court. Security is tight. Whenever I arrived for meetings with Waggoner, an armed guard looked me over before letting me in. Once, when I asked to use a men's room, the guard waited outside, apparently to insure that I did not wander off unattended. A.D.F. officials told me that, nearly every day, the group receives at least one threat.\n\nFive feet tall, fifty-one, and blond, Waggoner favors platform heels, skirt suits, and thick silver necklaces. Her office has a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and until recently she had always filled her workspace with Disney memorabilia. \"Just Mickey and Minnie-sort of the classics,\" she told me. A mother of three, she has often visited Disney parks, and even run marathons through them, but she told me that the Walt Disney Company's recent defense of L.G.B.T. rights has \"ruined the beauty.\" The Disney tchotchkes are gone, and on a credenza is a stack of copies of an illustrated children's book, \" She Is She .\" Its authors describe it as a celebration of femininity and motherhood to counter the promotion of nontraditional gender identities. It features a colorful drawing of Waggoner, \"a justice-seeking lawyer.\"\n\nWaggoner is what psychologists call an active listener. She gives empathetic nods and smiles even when she disagrees vehemently with what she is hearing. As I laid out a liberal critique of her cases, she kept smiling while calling what I'd just said \"absolute garbage.\" Lawyers who have faced her in the courtroom say that the corners of her lips seemingly never turn down. Keith Kemper, her former partner in a Seattle law firm, told me that, \"because she has a sweet disposition and a small stature, it is easy to say, 'Oh, here is this nice little girl.' But she is the sweetest killer you ever met.\" A former adversary likened Waggoner's countenance to that of Dolores Umbridge, the cheerfully authoritarian bureaucrat in the \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nWaggoner grew up in Longview, Washington, near the Oregon border, and belongs to the Assemblies of God, the largest Pentecostal denomination-part of a movement defined by speaking in tongues. Her father was the principal of an Assemblies of God school that Waggoner attended, and he later became an associate pastor of the church that ran the school. Waggoner told me that, around the age of thirteen, she felt a sudden calling to become a lawyer and \"defend religious freedom and Christian ministries in schools.\" The culture war of the day was over the teaching of creationism at church schools like her father's, and Waggoner said that, as a girl, she'd been vaguely aware of \"controversies over religious autonomy.\" But she also said that no earthly influence could account for her choice of vocation, given that no conservative Christian legal movement existed at the time. \"I don't know why I felt so strongly, but I am thankful for it,\" she told me. (Waggoner says that she wrote down her calling on a scrap of paper, which she keeps in her bedroom today.) She attended a regional college run by the Assemblies of God and then moved to Virginia Beach to attend Regent University School of Law, a pioneering evangelical law program founded, in 1986, by the Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson. After a clerkship at the Washington State Supreme Court, she practiced for sixteen years at the Seattle firm, which often represented churches.\n\nDuring Sears's tenure, A.D.F. was almost unknown outside conservative Christian circles. Its lawyers viewed mainstream news organizations as hostile, and, like most attorneys, they worried that clients who spoke publicly might undermine their cases. But, during the electoral contests over same-sex marriage, L.G.B.T. activists had won support by presenting the media with sympathetic images of gay and lesbian couples-ordinary-looking people asking for things like hospital-visitation rights. Waggoner, avoiding the forbidden words \"gay marriage\" or \"gay rights,\" told me that A.D.F.'s opponents \"are very good at bringing to bear who's affected if their viewpoint isn't adopted.\" When she took over A.D.F.'s legal strategy, she decided to borrow that playbook and show that conservative Christians could be victims, too-that liberal laws and precedents \"create real harm, that real people are affected, and these people don't have horns. They aren't hateful people.\"\n\nHer test case was Jack Phillips, the owner of a Colorado business called Masterpiece Cakeshop. A ruggedly handsome and ambitiously artful baker, Phillips, who is now sixty-seven, claimed a First Amendment right to refuse to bake a gay couple's wedding cake. In 2017, Waggoner joined him on \"The View,\" ABC's rowdy daytime talk show. Most of the show's five female hosts were noisily liberal, and it was impossible to imagine Sears, the anti-porn crusader, at their table. Waggoner fit right in. Phillips's case was not just about a gay couple, she insisted. \"Jack's dignity is at issue as well,\" she said. One could support same-sex marriage while still supporting \"artists like Jack,\" Waggoner told the hosts, adding, \"If the state can crush Jack, it can crush every single one of us.\"\n\nThe \"View\" hosts grilled them on the Biblical basis for the baker's objection. Didn't the Good Book tell us not to judge? Didn't Jesus \"hang out\" with the lowest of the low? The co-host Joy Behar exclaimed, \"Jesus would have made the cake!\" She then immediately mocked herself for \"speaking for Jesus.\"\n\nWaggoner laughed as deeply as anyone. She must have known that her gambit was working. Chatting with five women citing Scripture and speaking for God, she sounded downright pluralistic. Sunny Hostin, a \"View\" co-host who is also a lawyer and a legal-affairs correspondent, conceded that she now could see \"both sides of this argument,\" adding, \"It is a closer call than I think we are giving credit for.\"\n\nPhillips and Waggoner went on to give six hundred media interviews. A.D.F. launched a team that produced polished videos about its plaintiffs. (Perhaps too polished. The Washington Post recently reported that A.D.F. employees posed as brides in videos promoting three clients who object to filming or photographing gay weddings.) Mainstream-media campaigns became a core part of its repertoire. Waggoner told me, \"Some of the lawyers were having an absolute heart attack. But I said, 'No, you will prep your client, and your client will talk about the case!' \"\n\nIn oral arguments, Waggoner mounted an innovative theory: it might be unlawful discrimination if a baker declined to sell a premade cake to a gay customer, but forcing the baker to design a cake celebrating a gay wedding would constitute constitutionally impermissible \"compelled speech,\" like requiring a St. Patrick's Day parade to allow a gay-pride banner. She told me, \"I have tried to bring to A.D.F. a spirit of offense rather than defense. I'd rather have the A.C.L.U. and Planned Parenthood worried about what we are doing-not the other way around.\"\n\nHumanizing A.D.F.'s clients serves another important purpose-motivating donors-and the organization's revenue has doubled in the five years since Waggoner stepped up its media outreach. According to the leaked video call, donors who give a hundred thousand dollars a year or more were expected to account for more than half A.D.F.'s fund-raising in the past fiscal year-upward of fifty million dollars.\n\nDirect fund-raising-such as telemarketing and TV commercials-was expected to bring in about twenty-seven million dollars. I signed up for A.D.F. e-mails, and they were alarming: \"Government told school to choose between faith and food\"; \"School silences 7th grader.\" But on the video call a staff member told the fund-raisers that A.D.F. wasn't \"trying to provoke fear.\" The goal was to \"communicate what the problem is, and the solution-which is A.D.F.\"\n\nThe fund-raising department's motto is \"We dig ditches.\" On the video call, Keaton Sauncy, a senior fund-raiser, explained that the phrase referred to an Old Testament passage. During a battle with the Moabites, God told the Israelites to catch floodwater in ditches. The Moabites \"see the reflection of the sun in them, and they think it is blood, and they are scared, and they kill themselves, and we win!,\" Sauncy said, somewhat garbling the story. The moral, he said, was that if the fund-raisers do their work \"God is going to bring that rain.\"\n\nLance Bauslaugh, the fund-raising head, told the staff to keep \"that Holy Spirit swagger\" and to think about \"cultivating the remnant\"-a term used in end-time prophecies to describe the few who resist the descent into sin before the apocalypse. He reported that, according to an A.D.F. study, twenty million Americans could be donors. \"Is that part of the remnant?\" he asked.\n\nTalk of ditches full of blood seemed out of step with Waggoner's sunny persona, at first. But, the more we talked, the more I realized that her assessment of what she calls \"the current cultural moment\" is also quite bleak. She repeatedly invoked the case of Päivi Räsänen, a Finnish legislator who is represented by A.D.F.'s international division, which was launched in 2008. Räsänen is fighting hate-crime charges over a social-media post in which she cited a Bible verse and called homosexuality \"dysfunctional,\" a \"disorder,\" and sinful. Waggoner described the case as \"the tip of the spear in the Western world,\" and said that, more and more, U.S. government officials were \"gaining power in order to create or impose a new orthodoxy in human sexuality and sexual ethics.\" With a smile, she added, \"I see a lot of darkness.\"\n\nWhat Waggoner calls a \"new orthodoxy,\" of course, is what liberals call freedom and equality: the right to choose a partner of any sex, to take pride in a nontraditional gender identity, to make decisions about your own body. But A.D.F. sees the story of the past sixty years as a historic aberration. For centuries, nearly every major civilization had held similar beliefs: sex was for married heterosexuals; making babies was the point. But, beginning in the nineteen-sixties, the Supreme Court began abetting a radical transformation in sexual ethics by citing a novel \"right to privacy,\" initially in a case about married couples purchasing condoms. By expanding that right to cover abortion, gay sex, and same-sex marriage, the Court had effectively redefined sex as a form of individual self-expression. The only meaning or purpose of sex was in the minds of the adults having it. (In Casey, the majority held that sex was part of \"the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\") In this new era of \"plastic sex\"-a phrase that a Blackstone lecturer borrowed from the British sociologist Anthony Giddens-children all but vanished from the picture.\n\nNext, the A.D.F. story goes, advocates of plastic sex began redescribing sexual urges as group identities. Same-sex attraction, once a kink, now defined a person. And sex without fear of pregnancy was no longer merely a desire; the Court found that it was a necessary component of a free, full life, which meant that the right to abortion was essential to women. And the traditional view of sexuality-common to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam-was recast as bigotry.\n\nWaggoner referred me repeatedly to a dissent by Justice Alito in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. A.D.F. bulletins often quote Alito's words, which she deems prophetic. \"I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes,\" Alito warned. \"But if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.\"\n\nDepending on whom you ask, the Obergefell ruling either shaped or reflected a stunning transformation of American public opinion. Twice as many people now support same-sex marriage as oppose it-roughly the inverse of the ratio of only twenty years ago. Yet Waggoner contended to me that the agenda behind Obergefell was more sinister: \"The intent was to vilify those who believed in marriage between a man and a woman, and to use the law against them so that they would become enemies of the law. And that is exactly what we saw happen.\"\n\nWaggoner said that A.D.F. was \"not looking to polarize.\" She made a point of noting that members of her extended family are gay, and that she is friendly toward them. She even asserted that A.D.F. had represented openly gay clients-although, citing confidentiality, she wouldn't name any. \"Scripture says that homosexuality is wrong,\" she said. \"But it also says that lying is wrong. And Scripture teaches that you're entitled to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of what life-style choices you're making.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nYet: \"life-style choices.\" Would A.D.F. hire an L.G.B.T. person? Waggoner said, \"If someone were to say, 'I struggle with same-sex attraction,' that is different than saying, 'I am gay.' \" But \"we also believe that same-sex behavior is wrong, that it's a sin.\" Although people who identify as L.G.B.T. are entitled to respect, she noted, \"I should also be able to suggest that I think there's a different path that can be taken, and not be put in jail for that or censored by my government.\" (An A.D.F. spokesperson acknowledged that no American has ever been jailed or censored for homophobia. But he noted that anti-discrimination laws in New York and Minnesota allow jail time as a potential penalty.)\n\nTo L.G.B.T. people, \"life style\" and \"path\" are the code words of bigots. Still, Waggoner said that A.D.F. is consistent about its sexual ethics: divorce may lead to termination, depending on an assessment of the \"Biblical\" grounds for the breakup.\n\nLiberals, and some conservatives, say that A.D.F.'s fear of plastic-sex authoritarianism is wildly paranoid. Half the fifty states have not passed any law against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Supreme Court has never held that sexual orientation is a \"suspect class,\" like race, that warrants special scrutiny when it is used as a basis for laws, employment, housing, or other distinctions. Most important, the current Supreme Court appears to lean toward A.D.F.'s views. Andrew Koppelman, a professor of law and philosophy at Northwestern University who has studied A.D.F.'s cases, told me that ten years ago the group was considered so extreme that its claims \"bordered on the frivolous.\" Now \"A.D.F. needs to be taken seriously, because any claim they make has a shot at five votes on the Supreme Court.\" Even the majority opinion in Obergefell, by Justice Anthony Kennedy, included an unusual concession: \"Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here.\"\n\nIndeed, secular-liberal tyranny has been a running theme of some Justices. In a 2018 case, A.D.F. successfully opposed California's requirement that \"pro-life\" pregnancy-counselling centers post notices about the availability of public funding for abortion; the majority opinion, by Justice Clarence Thomas, likened the state's measure to Stalinism, Nazism, the Cultural Revolution in China, and Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu. (\"As they should!\" Waggoner told me. \"It was shocking!\") The next year, in a majority opinion that supported keeping a giant cross on public property, Alito warned of \"militantly secular regimes,\" such as a government that \"roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine.\" In the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, the Court ruled for the baker on the ground that the Colorado civil-rights commission had displayed an impermissible animus against his faith. (At a hearing, a commissioner had said that \"freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust,\" calling it \"despicable\" when people \"use their religion to hurt others.\")\n\nIn oral arguments for 303 Creative, the case about the Web designer, Justice Barrett made A.D.F.'s case more effectively than Waggoner did. The crux of A.D.F.'s reasoning was that Lorie Smith, the designer, objected only to a message of support for same-sex marriage but had no bias against L.G.B.T. people. Barrett asked Waggoner if her client would create a Web site for people who were \"cisgender and heterosexual\" but wanted their \"wedding story\" to convey that their sexes were \"irrelevant to our relationship, which transcends such categories\"?\n\nWaggoner later described to me her befuddled reaction: \"I was, like, 'cisgender'?\" When she began to say that her client would design such a Web site, Barrett cut her off and unspooled a fresh hypothetical: What about adulterous co-workers who wanted a wedding site celebrating their divorces? Wouldn't those messages violate the designer's Biblical views, regardless of the newlyweds' sexual orientation? Waggoner-now getting it-hastened to agree.\n\nA former A.D.F. lawyer told me that it was \"destructive\" of the organization to keep warning Christians \"that the Church is facing mortal peril, that it is on the brink of real persecution and destruction.\" In fact, the lawyer said, Christian legal rights are \"more secure than they have ever been,\" and A.D.F. itself \"is incredibly successful.\" But Waggoner told me that the issues A.D.F. was contesting \"would have been unimaginable to most Americans just fifteen years ago\" and that \"the staggering number of people requesting our help tells you this moment is an assault on our freedom.\" She added, \"Just because we have prevailed in some cases, that doesn't mean that the threat in our generation is not more significant than ever before.\"\n\nThe next priority for A.D.F., Waggoner told me, is fighting \"the radical gender-identity ideology infiltrating the law\"-that is, transgender rights. Waggoner said that she doesn't believe in transgender identity, only in \"gender dysphoria,\" adding, \"I believe there are people who are uncomfortable in their bodies.\" She cited growing numbers-the 1.4 per cent of American teen-agers now identifying as trans may be roughly double the percentage in 2017, according to a U.C.L.A. study of government data-as evidence that forces in culture, education, and the law have fuelled a \"social contagion.\" Schools were pushing minors too young to give meaningful consent toward irreversible \"sterilization and chemical castration,\" all to treat adolescent feelings of awkwardness that could be addressed by psychological counselling. It was all \"absurd,\" she insisted.\n\nA.D.F. began a pushback against \"gender identity\" in 2014, shortly after Waggoner joined the organization, as the head of its allied-attorney program. Its first effort centered on public bathrooms and school locker rooms, implicitly portraying transgender girls as a menace to others. A.D.F. mailed out a draft policy to school districts recommending sex segregation for any spaces \"where persons may be in a state of undress\" and defining sex as \"either male or female, as objectively determined by anatomy and/or genetics at the time of birth.\" The next year, the organization sent lawmakers model legislation that effectively offered a bounty to any student who found \"a person of the opposite sex\" in a bathroom or locker room. A student could sue a school for a payment of twenty-five hundred dollars, in addition to psychological damages and legal fees. Republican lawmakers introduced similar bills in at least ten states, and in 2016 North Carolina passed a version that applied to all public agencies.\n\nThe outcry was earthshaking: why were North Carolina Republicans so obsessed with bathroom encounters? Trade associations pulled conventions; PayPal and other companies withdrew plans to expand in the state; the N.B.A. relocated events; Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert. The Republican governor who signed the legislation went down to defeat in the next election, and his Democratic successor signed a repeal. A.D.F. had inadvertently delivered a victory for L.G.B.T. rights.\n\nA.D.F. overshot in court, too. It was defending a Detroit funeral parlor against claims of discrimination from an employee fired for announcing a gender transition and requesting a woman's uniform. The proprietor was Christian, and A.D.F.'s lawyers initially argued that the state could not force him to violate his religious beliefs. But, when the case reached the Supreme Court, A.D.F. sought a broader ruling, asking the Court to find that any employer could fire someone solely for identifying as transgender, because federal laws against sex discrimination didn't protect people who identify as L.G.B.T. John J. Bursch, the A.D.F. lawyer arguing the case, told the Court, \"Treating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women.\" The Court disagreed. L.G.B.T.-rights groups hailed the ruling, issued in 2020 as Bostock v. Clayton County. But Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, practically invited Waggoner to return to the Court with A.D.F.'s original argument about religious freedom. The Court remained \"deeply concerned\" about such matters, Gorsuch wrote, emphasizing that these were \"questions for future cases.\" Waggoner, taking the hint, told me that she expected to bring cases \"at the edges\" of Bostock.\n\nIn internal lectures, A.D.F. lawyers describe a change in strategy when Waggoner took over, six years ago: a drive to pick smarter battles, including in the court of public opinion. A Connecticut case against transgender rights exemplified the shift. In 2017, Andraya Yearwood and Terry Miller, transgender girls at a Connecticut high school, began setting sprinting records at statewide track meets. At the time, the National Collegiate Athletic Association required a year of hormone therapy before a transgender woman could compete in a female event, but Connecticut qualified girls on the basis of identity alone. Neither student had yet undergone any medical treatment, and in finish-line photographs they looked conspicuously bigger than other racers. Hulu later made a documentary hailing Yearwood as a pathbreaker. She told the filmmakers, \"On the girls' team, I just feel amazing, just knowing that I get to be who I am.\"\n\nWaggoner, who played basketball and volleyball in high school, told me, \"I felt like you knew, as a woman, that this is wrong.\" Seemingly aligning herself with nineteen-seventies feminism, she added, \"Underlying all of this is whether women have any rights at all, and it's shocking to me that we're even debating this, especially after fifty years of trying to advance those rights.\"\n\nBianca Stanescu, whose daughter Selina Soule lost medals to the trans girls, had started a petition opposing the state's rules. A.D.F. lawyers sought out the family and persuaded the Soules to file a lawsuit claiming that Connecticut's policy violated the Title IX guarantee of an equal chance for female athletes to compete and win. Selina was a far more sympathetic protagonist than a hypothetical student confronting someone in a bathroom. Tucker Carlson, then at Fox News, interviewed her, and she said, \"We missed out on winning the State Open Championship because of the team that the transgender athlete was on.\"\n\nWaggoner told me that conservative organizations and Republican politicians across the country have followed A.D.F.'s lead. \"We were the first,\" she said proudly. \"And, because we were willing to file suit, state legislators were coming to us and saying, 'What can we do in our state?' Now twenty-three states have passed laws to protect women's sports.\" The appeals court in New York is expected to issue a ruling in the Soule case soon; among many other transgender cases, A.D.F. has filed a suit in Alaska to protect the right of a shelter for battered women to turn away transgender clients.\n\nA.D.F. has now taken on suits across the country opposing liberal policies concerning children and adolescents who identify as transgender-relatively favorable terrain for its side of the fight. Waggoner told me that an A.D.F. goal is to persuade the Supreme Court to establish \"parental rights\" as a constitutional principle: \"It's not that the Court is going to say, 'Gender ideology is bad.' But I do think the Court could say, 'Parental rights are fundamental rights.' \"\n\nPrecedents from the nineteen-twenties protect the rights of parents to teach their children a foreign language or send them to Catholic schools, but the Court has said little else on the subject. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, an icon of conservative jurisprudence, declared in a 2015 speech that the Constitution guaranteed parents no such rights: \"My right to raise my children the way I want, to teach them what I want them taught, not what Big Brother says-that is not there.\" Following Scalia's logic, a Justice who finds a constitutional guarantee of parental rights would be as fanciful as the liberals who once detected a right to privacy in \"penumbras\" around the Bill of Rights. (Waggoner told me that Scalia was \"not perfect.\")\n\nA.D.F. staff in Washington are pushing for legislation that would make it easier to sue school districts for alleged violations of parental rights. Its lawyers have brought \"parental-rights\" cases both in appellate circuits that lean left and in others that lean right, increasing the chance that a split will compel the Supreme Court to take up the issue. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, part of the conservative circuit based in Chicago, A.D.F. is representing parents suing their school district for ignoring their request to treat their twelve-year-old as a girl (the child, for a time, had requested to be treated as a boy). And in Loudoun County, Virginia, part of the liberal circuit based in Richmond, A.D.F. is representing Christian teachers who oppose the district's policy of letting students choose their pronouns without telling their parents. (In 2021, A.D.F. won an appeals-court decision that a public college couldn't make a professor use a student's preferred pronouns.)\n\nA.D.F.'s campaign against L.G.B.T. rights can have an intimidating effect. Last November, in Asheville, North Carolina, the Reverend Ronald Gates, who volunteers as an A.D.F. community \"ambassador,\" appeared before the city's school board and repeatedly addressed a transgender woman on the board as \"Mr.\" When the board member, Peyton O'Connor, asked the pastor to \"refrain from bigotry and hate speech,\" Gates shouted, \"I will say 'Mr.'-if the blood was drawn, it would be XY, which is a male! \" (Gates didn't return my phone calls.)\n\nO'Connor subsequently resigned. She told me she'd been afraid that A.D.F. would turn the incident into yet another culture-war flash point. \"A.D.F. is really good at drawing people into these fights that are really of little consequence,\" she told me. \"It becomes a way to mobilize their base, and to draw more attention to these right-wing causes. If you look at their Web site, they use these things for the fund-raising drumbeat-like, 'We have got queers in the public-school systems! Everybody, give us money so we can fight this evil!' That is their business model.\" (An A.D.F. spokesperson said that, as a matter of policy, it doesn't confront individuals or elected officials, and that its ambassadors aren't authorized to speak for the organization.)\n\nPitting conservative Christian parents, employers, and creative professionals against L.G.B.T. rights reminded me of the incremental approach that A.D.F. and its allies had adopted during the long struggle to overturn Roe: undermining the precedent bit by bit, by defending parental-notification laws, waiting periods, and so on. With Roe gone, the surviving precedent most objectionable to conservative Christians is undoubtedly Obergefell-the same-sex marriage decision. In some ways, Obergefell is also fragile. Two of the five Justices in its majority, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy, have been replaced by conservatives, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. And some lawyers argue that the Obergefell majority fatally contradicted itself by calling the opposition to same-sex marriage \"decent and honorable.\" (Robert George, a Princeton legal scholar and another occasional lecturer at A.D.F.'s Blackstone program, told me, \"If that line is right, then the outcome is wrong.\") The majority concluded that the right to same-sex marriage was embedded in the Constitution's guarantees of due process, but in a vigorous dissent Alito quoted a precedent that \"due process\" includes only rights \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" He argued that \"it is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not among those rights.\" Alito's argument about \"deeply rooted\" rights is the exact argument that six Justices endorsed in overturning Roe.\n\nBy reinforcing Kennedy's \"decent and honorable\" caveat, A.D.F.'s victories have also undermined the idea that a right to same-sex marriage was ever \"deeply rooted.\" Shortly after the 303 Creative decision, a Christian justice of the peace in Waco, Texas, filed a lawsuit claiming that her religious conviction exempted her from performing same-sex marriages. She argued that the 303 Creative precedent \"rejects the idea of a 'compelling interest' \" in the equal treatment of same-sex couples.\n\nWaggoner did not want to discuss Obergefell. \"I'm worried you're gonna just use a choice little quote, and anybody that reads the article is going to think I'm abandoning Obergefell, and I am not,\" she said. \"I think it is wrong and it should be reversed, but I don't wake up in the morning thinking about how to do that.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nChanging the subject, she mentioned the recent Grammy Awards broadcast. Sam Smith, who identifies as nonbinary, had dressed as Satan for a raunchy S & M stage show with the trans singer Kim Petras. Waggoner said, \"What I wake up thinking about is what Obergefell has caused the current cultural moment.\"\n\nRecently, A.D.F. opened a new front in its \"parental-rights\" fight: a lawsuit over teaching about racism. The school district that includes Charlottesville, Virginia, began devising an anti-racist curriculum after white supremacists gathered there in 2017 for the Unite the Right rally. Two years ago, a middle-school pilot program was launched with a slide presentation that quoted the author and activist Ibram X. Kendi : \"Children are either going to learn racist or antiracist ideas. In other words, if we don't actively protect them from this dangerous racist society, what do you think they will be taught?\"\n\nAt school-board meetings, some parents objected that the curriculum's discussions of \"white privilege\" and a \"dominant culture\" taught racial stereotypes or stigmatized white people. One such parent, Carlos Ibañez, an oral surgeon who'd emigrated from Panama, alerted A.D.F., and became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit charging that the district had violated civil-rights laws by treating students differently on the basis of race.\n\nWaggoner told me that the case extended A.D.F.'s defense of parental rights; schools were treating children as \"the property of the state.\" She argued that the content of Charlottesville's curriculum was \"way outside the bounds\" of the Constitution's limits.\n\nI was surprised she'd plunged A.D.F. into debates about race. The suit does little \"to keep the door open for the Gospel.\" Instead of arguing for freedom of religion or expression, A.D.F. appeared to be policing the speech of Charlottesville teachers, seeking a ruling that certain lessons were off limits. What's more, A.D.F.'s arguments against anti-discrimination protections for L.G.B.T. people had already raised awkward questions about its stance toward other forms of bigotry.\n\nIn 2021, A.D.F. sued the Biden Administration for requiring that federally funded adoption agencies work with same-sex couples. A.D.F. argued that the policy violated the religious freedom of its client, Holston United Methodist Home for Children, in Tennessee. The Administration quickly folded; the Supreme Court had tipped the scales for Holston by ruling that a similar policy in the city of Philadelphia had violated the religious freedom of Catholic Social Services. But the next year Holston leveraged the same religious-freedom argument to reject a couple because they were Jewish. Gabriel Rutan-Ram, the would-be father, told me that Holston's decision was \"blatant antisemitism.\" With help from the liberal group Americans United for Separation of Church and State, he and his wife are now suing the Tennessee agency that partially funds Holston. (Waggoner told me that excluding Jews is \"not something we would advocate for,\" but argued that, under certain circumstances, a religious agency could have that right.)\n\nDuring oral arguments in 303 Creative, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused Waggoner of justifying all kinds of bigotry. If a designer could turn away a wedding commission because the partners were gay, what other couples could be rebuffed? Sotomayor asked, \"How about people who don't believe in interracial marriage, or about people who don't believe that disabled people should get married?\" Where would Waggoner draw \"a limiting line\"?\n\nWaggoner, struggling to deflect, first proposed that a true bigot would refuse to serve a whole category of people-Blacks, the disabled, people who identify as L.G.B.T. But 303 Creative welcomed gay clients and objected only to gay weddings.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked a hypothetical photographer selling pictures of children with Santa. Although he takes portraits of Black children in other contexts, he wants these shots to evoke a nostalgic, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" feeling. Can he turn away Black children in the name of his art? Waggoner was forced to concede that her free-speech argument might indeed protect racists. The Court, she noted, had \"protected vile, awful, reprehensible, violent speech in the past.\"\n\nWhen I asked Waggoner about the exchange, she grew almost heated. She said that I'd \"pushed a button,\" and complained that invoking the spectre of racism was a tactic \"designed to malign, shame, and bully people.\"\n\nLike the Charlottesville race case, many of A.D.F.'s recent battles turn on a similar question: Who's bullying whom? Have conservative Christians, as Alito claims, become an imperilled minority, whispering in the recesses of their homes that marriage is between a man and a woman?\n\nWaggoner's critics say that she ignores history. Conservative Christians may be a minority now, but civil-rights laws don't protect Black or L.G.B.T. people simply because they're outnumbered. Sarah Warbelow, of the Human Rights Campaign, told me, \" 'Minorities' is the wrong word. The argument is for protections for vulnerable people-individuals and classes of people who have historically, and ongoingly, experienced discrimination in the public sphere, in public accommodation, housing, employment, credit, and education. The vast majority of Christians are not being discriminated against in these areas of life. A baker is not refusing to make a baptismal or First Communion cake for their child.\"\n\nIn Waggoner's conversations with me, she made an argument that she got cut off trying to make during the 303 Creative case. The difference between turning down a same-sex couple and turning down an interracial couple, she told me, was in the historic roots of the motivation. In Loving v. Virginia, the Court had concluded that banning interracial marriage was \"part of a whole system of laws that were designed to subjugate a whole class of people, out of group bigotry.\" But the belief that marriage was between a man and a woman had a more dignified pedigree: \"the teachings of all the Abrahamic faiths.\" She said, \"So to suggest that those two things are in any way similar is either misinformed or it is designed to shut down the conversation.\"\n\nSlavery, of course, was also a centuries-old tradition whose defenders cited deep roots in the Abrahamic faiths. And Abraham himself was polygamous. But, for now, most of the Justices appear to share Waggoner's perspective. In 303 Creative, as the liberal Justices kept hammering her, Alito threw her a lifeline. In Obergefell, he prodded, \"did the Court say religious objections to same-sex marriage are the same thing as religious or other objections to people of color?\"\n\nNo, Waggoner answered, back on firm footing and playing along. With a smile, she repeated the words the Supreme Court had used to describe opposition to gay marriage: people like her were \"decent and honorable.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled Ruth Bader Ginsburg's name.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Post-Roe Abortion Underground\n\nThe handoff was planned for late afternoon on a weekday, at an underused trailhead in a Texas park. The young woman carrying the pills, whom I'll call Anna, arrived in advance of the designated time, as was her habit, to throw off anyone who might try to use her license plates to trace her identity. She felt slightly absurd in her disguise-sun hat, oversized sunglasses, plain black mask. But the pills in her pocket were used to induce abortions, and in Texas, her home state, their distribution now required such subterfuge, along with burner phones and the encrypted messaging app Signal. Since late June, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Texas and thirteen other states had effectively banned abortion, and more were sure to follow. In some of the states, laws that originated as far back as the nineteenth century had been restored. Providing the tools for an abortion in Texas had become a felony that could lead to years in prison, and a fellow-citizen could sue Anna and collect upward of ten thousand dollars for every abortion she was found to abet.\n\nAnna wasn't a fainthearted woman-someone who had recently approached her for pills noted her \"cottage-core vibes\" and steely calm-but she wasn't reckless, either. She and other women defying abortion bans had turned to a model developed by Verónica Cruz, a prominent Mexican activist. Until last year, abortion was considered a crime in most of Mexico, the second-biggest Catholic country in the world, and women there had become adept at providing safe abortions in secrecy. (Given the legal exposure, pseudonyms have been used for Anna and other American women who let me into their underground networks.)\n\nBy the time the pregnant woman for whom Anna was waiting walked up, the trailhead was quiet enough to make the chirping of birds seem jarring. As Anna pulled a plastic bag of pills from her pocket and settled across from the pregnant woman at a picnic table, she registered the fear on the woman's face. Her distress, as Anna understood it, was less about a breach of Texas law than about the possibility that her husband, who was violent, might find out what she was doing. Hands shaking, the woman told Anna that she was already raising three children and had been trying to save enough money to remove them from a dangerous home. The prospect of having another child, she said, was like \"getting a death sentence.\" She couldn't vanish from her household for a day without explanation, travel to a state where abortion is legal, and pay seven hundred dollars to a doctor for a prescription. Anna's pills, which were free, were her best option. Taking the baggie and some instructions on how to take the medication, the woman thanked Anna and fled the park, hoping that her husband would never realize she'd been gone.\n\nHear from women distributing abortion medication illegally, on The New Yorker Radio Hour.\n\nThe town of San Miguel de Allende, in central Mexico, is known as the birthplace of legendary independence leaders. It is just as famous for its charm: cobblestone streets, Baroque churches, bright houses, and lively cantinas once frequented by Mexican muralists and Beat poets. Some Americans visit for a week and decide to stay. Among those expats is Liz, a retired Southern woman in her seventies. On the morning of June 24th, as she was making coffee in a kitchen where photographs of her great-grandchildren covered the fridge, she heard on the radio that the constitutional right to abortion in the United States had ended. She maneuvered her walker to a nearby chair and sank down. She felt as she had as a child, in a house by the sea where she'd once lived, when a hurricane she'd been dreading made landfall. It was awful, yes, but knowing what was coming had given her a chance to gather her courage and make a plan.\n\nFive years earlier, Liz had met Verónica Cruz, who runs a nonprofit called Las Libres-the Free Ones-out of the city of Guanajuato, some fifty miles west of San Miguel. At the time, Cruz was defying Mexican law by helping women-mostly poor women-abort at home. In part because activists like Cruz successfully reduced the stigma of abortion, the Supreme Court of Mexico decriminalized it in September, 2021. That same month, Texas moved in the opposite direction: a state law known as S.B. 8 banned nearly all abortions past the sixth week. Since then, Cruz had widened her remit, supplying free abortion pills to undocumented women in Texas.\n\nLiz figured that, with Roe overturned and states from Arkansas to South Dakota implementing abortion restrictions, the demand for Mexican abortion pills would soar. If she lacked Cruz's decades of experience working on the cusp between the lawful and the criminal, she was neither too old nor too diminished to take a risk. She picked up the phone to call Cruz and then some friends, to find out which of them would be game to join an underground network.\n\nLocals called expats like Liz \"the Old Hippies,\" in English. In early July, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision negated Roe, six of them joined Liz on her terrace for hibiscus tea and a talk with Cruz. Most of the Americans were over sixty and recalled what life was like before the 1973 Roe ruling. One tactic Liz remembered for ending an unwanted pregnancy was to alternate between a tub of ice-cold water and a tub as scalding as you could bear it. Those who tried this method suffered, then usually had a baby anyway. Liz had a baby, too, as a teen-ager. Although she had cheered when the Roe decision was announced, knowing how many lives it would change, it had come too late to change hers.\n\nCruz, the fifty-one-year-old daughter of farmers, has appraising dark eyes and a booming voice, and is direct by nature. She asked the Old Hippies if they would raise money and buy pills in Mexico that would be distributed across the border. Cruz paused to let an Old Hippie translate for those whose Spanish was weak.\n\nMedication abortion in the United States is typically a two-day process that involves taking mifepristone, which blocks progesterone, and misoprostol, which causes uterine contractions. The Food and Drug Administration approves the use of this two-pill regimen under a doctor's supervision up until the tenth week of pregnancy. A prescription, which can be obtained in states where abortion is legal, is required. In Mexico, Cruz explained, misoprostol is sold over the counter. Mifepristone still requires a prescription, but Cruz had found suppliers, and when she ran short she relied solely on misoprostol, which can cause an abortion on its own.\n\nLink copied\n\nImmediately after Dobbs, Cruz said, her existing crew of volunteers had slipped enough medication across the border to help two thousand American women have abortions. If the Old Hippies agreed to aid distributors in abortion-ban states, Cruz told them, Las Libres could help many more women. Each cell in the supply chain would know little about the other cells-safer for everyone that way.\n\nSeveral Old Hippies wondered aloud about consequences, as the legal terrain was decidedly unsettled. In Louisiana, anyone who \"knowingly performs\" a medication abortion is subject to a five-year prison sentence and a fifty-­thousand-dollar fine. In Oklahoma, it's a ten-year sentence and a hundred thousand dollar fine. More such laws were likely to come, although no criminal convictions had yet been reported. If charged, an Old Hippie told Cruz, they might end up at the mercy of a district attorney in, say, Mississippi, facing years of jail time. But Liz was an optimist-\"You have to be,\" she always said-and by meeting's end everyone in the room had signed on to her plan.\n\nTo avoid what Liz called the \"gringo price,\" she recruited her housekeeper to call more than two dozen pharmacies in San Miguel and find out what they had in stock, at what cost. Then the Old Hippies tried to buy all the pills they could. One pharmacist agreed to sell more than a hundred boxes but cancelled the order at the last minute without explanation. A second pharmacist demanded a prescription for misoprostol, something not required by Mexican law; an Old Hippie had to persuade her doctor to prescribe it for an ulcer, a condition that she didn't really have but for which the drug was also used. It was a relief when a third pharmacist agreed to sell more than a hundred and fifty boxes with no questions asked.\n\nMany of the pickups were handled by Diana, another Old Hippie, who at pharmacies gravitated to younger female clerks-less judgmental about her purchases, perhaps, than older men. On the day that she unpacked the last of the hundred and fifty boxes on her kitchen counter, she burst into tears. Every box contained more than enough pills for two abortions, and she saw in the stockpile before her hundreds of younger women who would be helped. \"All of a sudden,\" Diana said, \"I realized what we're all doing.\" Those boxes just needed to get to the States, but that part of the relay would be left to others, as Diana, Liz, and other Old Hippies planned their next buy.\n\nSix weeks later, sitting at a long table in a house on a hill in Guanajuato, Cruz counselled a woman in Georgia by phone while responding to a text from Arkansas: \"I would like help with a medication.\" A window behind Cruz overlooked a lemon grove, and around the table were colleagues-some social workers, some lawyers, most of them young-fielding questions from pregnant women on both sides of the border. The atmosphere was convivial, and taped on one wall was a phonetic cheat sheet for those with limited English: \" Jai, dis is Las Libres. Can ay jelp iu ?\"\n\nCruz's work had long been funded by American nonprofits, and after Dobbs the phone number of her organization was passed around by informal networks of activists. Cruz said that she was now getting fifty requests a day from the U.S. for abortion pills. Some women created fake profiles on Instagram to get in touch with her, or sent messages on WhatsApp or Signal, or called her in the middle of the night.\n\nThe evasiveness and fear that she sensed when communicating with Americans reminded her of how Mexican women spoke of abortion when she was growing up. Her mother worked on a farm, harvesting corn, and the only way she and her girlfriends alluded to abortion and miscarriage was with the expression malas camas -\"bad beds.\" Such euphemisms were necessary in part because women in the state of Guanajuato could face up to three years in prison for ending a pregnancy, and so could the medical personnel who assisted them. Before last year's Mexican Supreme Court decision, abortion, in all cases except for rape, was deemed a criminal act in Guanajuato, where state law presumed that life began at the moment of conception. There is no reliable estimate of how many women died annually from secret abortions; authorities and family members often blamed the deaths on infection or hemorrhage.\n\nIn 1995, Cruz had completed training as a social worker and was helping Indigenous farmers improve their crop yields and distribution when, in a coffee shop, she heard an older woman discussing abortion in a way she hadn't heard in school. The woman, who had attended a United Nations conference on reproductive rights, was speaking about abortion unapologetically, as a matter of public health that disproportionately affected poor women and curtailed their rights. Cruz was surprised, and energized.\n\nWord had been getting out, first in Brazil and then across Latin America, about an expensive American drug that allowed a person to end a pregnancy at home. Manufactured by Pfizer under the name Cytotec and otherwise known as misoprostol, it was available over the counter in Mexico to treat gastric ulcers-to this day, the only use of the drug that Pfizer supports. (\"The industry has never been an ally of women's struggles,\" said Raffaela Schiavon, a respected obstetrician-gynecologist in Mexico City.) Cytotec came in boxes of twenty-eight pills. Pregnant women who could afford it consulted other women who had had abortions and calibrated the dosage that would suit their bodies and stages of pregnancy. Some women took four or eight pills orally, and others inserted pills vaginally. When the abortions were done, Cruz had noticed, they'd typically toss out the remainder of the pills-a small fact that would later change the course of her work.\n\nMexican supporters of abortion rights were, and remain, up against a coalition of conservative politicians and leaders of the Catholic Church. When, in 2000, Guanajuato state legislators voted to make abortion illegal even for rape victims, subjecting them to years in prison, Cruz joined other activists to protest. But she wanted to do more than march on a statehouse­-she wanted to make sure that rape victims could still get abortions. She started Las Libres and began asking those who bought boxes of misoprostol for an abortion to set aside the remainder of the pills for women who had been raped. Cruz recalled, \"We said, 'Keep them, and next time someone comes to us you'll give them the pills and talk about your experience.' \" The idea was to make abortion not just more accessible but less frightening. A pregnant woman could meet someone who had survived an abortion and gone on with her life. Cruz called the woman who shared her pills and her experience an acompañante -a person who accompanies another.\n\nEventually, opposition to the new state law became so great that the governor vetoed it, at which point Cruz decided to take her activism a step further and help women in Guanajuato who wanted an abortion for any reason at all. The acompañantes she recruited would bring pills and tips about how to use them, providing comfort and answering questions during the abortion process. Because the acompañante figure did not explicitly appear in Mexican criminal codes, Cruz argued that such a person would be immune to prosecution.\n\nAccording to Georgina Sánchez, an academic at El Colegio de la Frontera Sur who has researched medication abortion in Mexico, some feminists were skeptical about the acompañamiento model. Ordinary citizens would have to shoulder the state's responsibility to provide health care to women, and acompañantes would become vulnerable to the whims of authorities. They, and Cruz, might end up in jail. \"Me being me,\" Cruz recalled, \"I told them, 'Well, you'll have to get me out!' \" The way Cruz saw it, women had a moral duty to stand up for one another when the state failed to guarantee their rights.\n\n\"At first, women would come to us and say, under their breath, 'I need an abortion,' \" Cruz told me. But she began convening meetings in bars and cafés, where she spoke emphatically about abortion as a right to be asserted, not a clandestine affair. \"It was our way of saying, 'Don't be afraid. You have nothing to be ashamed of,' \" Cruz said, adding, \"There were times when the waitresses would come by afterward and say, 'How did you say one takes the pills?' \"\n\nThe acompañante movement grew, and so did Cruz's influence. Working with a team of lawyers, she visited ten jails in the state of Guanajuato, in search of women being held for abortion-­related crimes. They found nine wo­men charged with infanticide when circumstances suggested miscarriage or other birth complications. Most of the wo­m­en had been given sentences ranging from twenty-five to thirty years and had already spent more than four years behind bars. Javier Cruz Angulo, a criminal lawyer who worked with Cruz, said that not all of them could read or write, and that \"none of them fully understood why they had been prosecuted.\" In 2010, Las Libres finally helped secure the release of all nine women, and Cruz went on to investigate similar convictions in other states.\n\nIn those states and elsewhere in Mexico, grassroots organizations were also campaigning for the liberalization of abortion laws. The capital, Mexico City, had already decriminalized abortion, in 2007. After sustained campaigns, the state of Oaxaca followed, in 2019, and in 2021 so did Hidalgo and Veracruz-just before the Supreme Court declared the criminalizing of abortion unconstitutional. \"We are all pro-life,\" the chief justice, Arturo Zaldívar, said, \"only some of us are in favor of allowing women to live a life in which their dignity is respected, and they can exercise their rights fully.\" The evening of the decision, which was unanimous, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook the capital-to some anti-abortionists, a sign of divine wrath.\n\nIn the following months, after S.B. 8 took effect in Texas and Cruz began sharing pills with activists there, she came to understand that she and some of her U.S. colleagues differed in their idea of what being an acompañante entailed. The Americans had been driving people to clinics and helping pay for the procedure for years; now they were planning to travel farther, to states with fewer restrictions. The Mexicans' experience of aiding women had little to do with clinics. Rather, their model was one that Cruz believed her American contacts would need in the years ahead: a process of aborting that, in addition to being medically safe and effective (as a study of the acompañamiento practice in Argentina and Nigeria, published in The Lancet Global Health , had recently found it to be), also minimized the risk of criminal prosecution. If women avoided doctors and medical establishments and followed the blueprint of Las Libres, Cruz said, \"there wouldn't be a single trace. If the woman getting the abortion kept it to herself, no one would ever find out.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn the Americas, one of the privileges of advanced age is getting the benefit of the doubt at security checkpoints. The first person to run the Old Hippies' pills over the border was a gray-maned, soft-spoken Social Security recipient named Rosie. She would pave the way for the second border crosser, an octogenarian.\n\nWhen Rosie first met Cruz, she was too intimidated to speak; the activist, she said, seemed \"like a rock star to me.\" But she returned home from the meeting brimming with purpose. Pouring her husband a glass of red wine, she said, \"Honey, I'm going to be sneaking some pills across the border.\" Her husband did not take this news calmly. What if the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, decided to make an example out of some grandma? What if all their savings went toward hiring lawyers and bailing Rosie out of jail? \"Our retirement money is limited,\" he told her. \"What the heck are you doing?\" Her kids, mercifully, were indifferent. \"They don't take their parents very seriously,\" Rosie explained. No matter. Because she happened to reside in Mexico, she had an opportunity to change the lives, and maybe even save the lives, of younger women. \"I have never felt so important,\" she said.\n\nRosie's specific assignment was to pick up a cache of pills, travel across the border, and mail them to a volunteer in Texas, who, in turn, would deliver the pills to women who had asked for them. Rosie had been told that crossing the border was necessary because packages sent from within the United States receive less scrutiny than those sent from abroad. Of course, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has its own rules and levels of scrutiny for goods entering the country. It requires that any medication brought into the U.S. have a doctor's note or prescription and tells travellers not to carry more than a ninety-­day supply.\n\nRosie had been crossing the border for twenty years, and, as she planned her first journey with abortion pills, she realized that although Border Patrol agents had sometimes searched her luggage and X-rayed her car, they had never opened her toiletry kit. It was there that she tucked two plastic bottles containing three hundred and thirty-six pills of misoprostol. She placed the kit in an overnight bag, said goodbye to her husband, got in her pickup truck, and headed to Texas.\n\nNot long afterward, she walked into a post office, the sound of rattling accompanying each step-hundreds of pills in plastic bottles, seeming to announce themselves from her bag. Unnerved by the noise, she packed the pill bottles into a box, approached a clerk at the counter, and reflexively pulled out a credit card to pay the postage. As the printer spat out her receipt, it dawned on her that she'd created the sort of paper trail illicit suppliers like herself were supposed to avoid.\n\nThe recipient of the box was a Las Libres associate elsewhere in Texas, and Rosie had left the return address blank. Back home, searching the Internet, she learned that the lack of a return address was a red flag to postal inspectors-\"like the kind of thing a drug dealer would send,\" she said. Mailing pills within Texas to facilitate a self-induced abortion there is a felony punishable by up to two years in prison. If the pills eventually wound up in Mississippi, she could face up to five years in prison and additional charges for racketeering.\n\nTwo days later, the package arrived safely at its destination, and only then was Rosie able to sleep. Waking up the following morning, she wanted to do it again. Before long, her husband would be raising money for misoprostol buys, and associates in the syndicate would be referring to her by the nickname Pills on Wheels.\n\nThree months in, the Old Hippies of San Miguel de Allende had raised ten thousand dollars to buy abortion pills-a decent haul, in the estimation of Liz, the great-­grandmother, given that they had to persuade people to part with their money while sharing little about what would be done with it. Keeping donors ignorant was crucial because, post-Roe, giving money to a network like theirs could be construed as a crime.\n\nThe end of Roe had emboldened conservative activists and politicians in the U.S. After the court ruling, the Department of Health and Human Services assured doctors from states where bans had taken effect that they would not face prosecution under federal law for performing an abortion when the mother's life was on the line-a decision that prompted Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, to sue the federal government.\n\nNow that clinics in abortion-ban states had closed, conservative activists were targeting nonprofits that gave women money to travel for the procedure. These funds were now \"criminal organizations,\" in the words of Briscoe Cain, a Texas state congressman. As Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at the University of California at Davis, points out, one lesson of S.B. 8 is that a threat of legal consequences is enough to empty a state of abortion providers, regardless of whether there are prosecutions. This summer, many abortion funds in Texas ceased operation.\n\nConservative lawmakers were also threatening private companies, among them Lyft, that promised to reimburse employees for out-of-state travel to get abortions. Writing to an international law firm, Sidley Austin, which has offices in Houston and Dal­las, eleven legislators warned it not to help employees \"murder their unborn children.\" Texas criminal prohibitions, the legislators said, extended to medication abortions, \"even if the drugs were dispensed by an out-of-state abortionist.\"\n\nOne of the best-known attempts to prosecute a ring of abortion providers in the United States occurred in 1972, when seven women belonging to a group known as the Jane Collective were arrested in Chicago. Members of the collective, which evolved from the efforts of a Uni­versity of Chicago student to help a friend's sister secure an underground abortion, lacked medical training; however, they had taught themselves to do the procedure ac­cording to clinical safety standards. Their hope was to improve the odds of pregnant wom­en sur­viving what the historian Alicia Gutierrez-­Romine calls \"abortion roulette.\" For most of the last century, women of means who sought to end a pregnancy turned to obste­tricians and gyne­cologists who, for a steep price, performed illegal abortions on the side, while women with fewer resources risked having a vital organ punctured or bleeding to death. The Janes had done thousands of abortions in the years before the seven women were arrested. Charged with performing and conspiring to perform abortions, each of them faced a sentence of more than a hundred years in prison if convicted. However, when Roe was announced, in January, 1973, the charges against them were dropped.\n\nIt's not yet clear whether, after Dobbs, authorities will choose to prosecute people for involvement in networks like Cruz's. Amy O'Donnell, a spokesperson for the Texas Alliance for Life, argues that state law already allows for the extradition on felony charges of those who bring abortion drugs into Texas from other states. How­ever, extradition of people who reside outside the country is a federal matter and, she speculates, would likely not happen without the election of a President with anti-­abortion views.\n\nEven within Texas and other states with strong laws against abortion facilitators, the politics of enforcing penalties is complex, in part because the belief that abortion equals murder doesn't appear to be widespread. A survey released last month found that, among Texas voters, sixty per cent ­favored abortion being \"available in all or most cases,\" while only ten per cent supported banning abortion completely. In this political context, David Donatti, a civil-rights attorney at the A.C.L.U. of Texas, says, \"conservative legislators would benefit just as much from pretending no abortions are happening as they would from prosecuting abortions.\"\n\nEarly on in her American mission, trying to assess the sorts of risks volunteers might encounter crossing the border with pills, Verónica Cruz arranged a trial run. Five hundred pills arrived in Texas unhindered. Her methods for determining whether the people she chose to make the runs were sincere and not setting her up for trouble were somewhat less concrete. She made those decisions, she said, \"by feeling.\" When Claire, a California woman who spent part of the year in Mexico, heard about the network and contacted Cruz about becoming a pill runner, she didn't get an assignment immediately. Instead, Cruz came to her house in San Miguel and spent hours \"sniffing me out,\" Claire said. Claire didn't know about the Old Hippies and didn't need to. As Cruz said once she came to trust Claire, one person could be a network of her own.\n\nClaire slipped her first batch of pills into the States in May, and mailed packages to women all over the country. Three months later, shortly before her second run, she dashed through an artisan market, past a woman charring corn over an open flame, to a stall that sold flower-shaped earrings crafted by Huichol people in the Sierra Madre mountains. Each piece was made of colorful glass beads.\n\nLink copied\n\n\" Hola, ¿cuánto cuesta? \"\n\n\" Cincuenta pesos .\"\n\nTwo dollars and fifty cents. Paying in cash, she bought twenty pairs of ear­rings-sunflowers, camellias, roses-to camouflage the abortion pills she'd be bringing back to the U.S. She would put the earrings in cardboard jewelry boxes that had a layer of ­cotton padding. The earrings would go on top of the cotton, and the pills would be embedded inside, the better to keep a husband or parent from finding them. But Claire, who had had two abortions herself, liked the idea of placing earrings in every package for reasons other than discretion. \"It's so stressful to be pregnant when you don't want to be,\" she said. \"You have all these hormones going, you don't like the way your body feels, you just want it to be over, and so I thought, It'd be nice to get a pair of earrings when you're in that kind of mood. You know, an abortion and a present!\"\n\nShe made her way out of the market, past portable shrines for the Virgin of Guadalupe and hearts of blown glass, and ran home, where Cruz was waiting at her door, navy-blue backpack in hand. \"Little earrings,\" Claire called out, \" para las chicas! \"\n\nAt the kitchen counter, Cruz unzipped the backpack and pulled out blister packs of mifepristone and misoprostol, and Claire took a pair of scissors from a drawer. They cut open each of the packs, combining six pills of misoprostol with one of mifepristone-usually sufficient for one abortion. Each envelope would also contain instructions on the abortion process which Cruz and Claire had written together. The notes ended, \"Hugs, the pill fairy.\"\n\nThe pills that Claire and other fairies would be sending remained cheaper to obtain from a Mexican pharmacy than from a doctor in the U.S. But, after Dobbs, the price of a box of Pfizer pills in several establishments in San Miguel de Allende had markedly increased. In one pharmacy, the price rose from about two thousand pesos per box to more than three thousand, or from roughly a hundred dollars to a hundred and sixty. The cost of generic misoprostol fluctuated wildly-forty-five dollars in one pharmacy, seventeen in another-and at the nearby Costco you could encounter two different prices for the drug in a single day. If the inflation seen in San Miguel pharmacies suggested private-sector opportunism, it might also have reflected well-meaning expats dominating the market, clearing the shelves on behalf of Americans and, in the process, jacking up the price of abortion for Mexican wom­en-an ethical dilemma that some of Cruz's associates had yet to think deeply about.\n\nAs they divvied up pills, Claire mentioned to Cruz that crossing the border with pharmaceuticals was not, for her, a big deal. \"I have Global Entry,\" she said. \"I've never been stopped by customs in my life.\" But, when she'd asked a friend if she would consider joining her as a pill runner, the friend had responded, \"I'm Black. I can't do that. Isn't that obvious to you?\"\n\nOn Claire's first mission, she'd sent pills to women in seven states where, if her actions were discovered, they could be seen as a crime. But she was given less to paranoia than to curiosity. Preparing to send her first lot of pills, she had Googled the addresses where they would land: trailer parks, run-down apartments, a house valued at thirty-four thousand dollars. She'd envisioned women with other children and tapped-out bank accounts who couldn't travel out of state for an abortion. She had to force herself not to Google any further, should authorities uncover the digital footprint she now regretted having created. This time, she had resolved simply to cross the border, mail the earrings and pills in an envelope with a fake return address, pay the post office in cash, take a photo of the tracking number, and destroy all receipts. She would later delete the photo of the tracking number, too.\n\nFinishing up, as salsa music drifted in from another room, Claire asked Cruz about the varieties of civil disobedience that led the Mexican Supreme Court to decriminalize abortion. Cruz told her that she thought of herself as part of an ant colony: one of countless workers toiling beneath an unbroken surface, carving intricate paths toward their goal. \"Was all of this hidden from the public eye?\" Claire wondered. Cruz shook her head. From the start, Las Libres members defied the system openly. In the United States, as in Mexico, Cruz predicted, the more people who got involved in the movement, the harder it would be for anyone to stop it.\n\nA few days later, as Cruz trained future acompañantes in Yucatán, Claire packed abortion pills and earrings in a carry-on alongside her perfume, oregano-­oil capsules, and shea butter and caught an early-morning bus to the airport in Mexico City.\n\n\"Bringing anything back, Ma'am?\" the customs agent asked when she arrived in San Francisco.\n\n\"Just some souvenirs.\"\n\nHanding her passport back, the agent said, \"Welcome home.\"\n\nWhen you risk years in prison to distribute abortion pills to wom­en who wouldn't otherwise be able to access them in Texas, you tend to appreciate more straightforward aspects of existence. So Anna delighted in an okra plant in her small garden that, by September, had sprung up to twice her height. Her tomatoes were thriving, as were the rosemary and parsley, and one day, as she picked up some jalapeño seeds left over from a seasonal planting, it occurred to her to hide pills in a packet of seeds. You never knew which recipient might have a patch of dirt in which to plant them.\n\nIt had taken some time for Las Libres to find collaborators like Anna. After S.B. 8 went into effect, Cruz and her colleagues identified thirty abortion-rights groups in Texas that they thought might be interested in receiving pills from Mexico. The first meeting of the Mexican and American activists had been awkward, though. The Mexicans had gathered in a conference room; the Texans joined the meeting individually, via Zoom. Most of their cameras were off, and the sound was bad. At the end of the meeting, when Cruz asked who was interested in collaborating, only one person raised her hand. There followed a long silence, until one of the Texans unmuted her sound. \"The law has won,\" she said. \"They accomplished what they wanted: scare us to the point where we feel there is nothing to be done.\" Only later did messages from some of the participants begin to trickle in, on Signal. They had been reluctant to assert their intention on a video call, but they were ready to work with Cruz.\n\nAnna's first move had been to post on social media that she could be of help to women in need-a post that never mentioned abortion directly. She said the same to strangers and friends in bars and cafés, just as Cruz used to do in Mexico, even as the penalties she might face increased.\n\nLink copied\n\nMany of Anna's pills almost certainly came from the Old Hippies of San Miguel de Allende, but she eschewed such precise information, for her own protection and that of others. She found mailing the pills especially nerve-racking; for reasons she couldn't quite explain, she chose as a fake return address a shopping mall where, in third grade, she'd made a joyful trip with her mom to get her ears pierced. It was better to hand off the pills in person, she thought, because those exchanges were harder for authorities to track and safer for women who lived in homes where an envelope with a dubious return address might be opened by the wrong hands.\n\nShe'd set a hard rule for herself, early on: to meet pregnant women only in parks or other public spaces that could not easily be linked back to her neighborhood or her job. Some days, self-conscious about her disguise, she thought she'd be the last person in Texas still wear­ing a mask outside. Other days, sympathetic, she decided hard rules could be broken, as when she capitulated to the grandmother of an eighth grader who insisted that the only place she'd feel safe collecting pills was in Anna's own home.\n\nThe pregnant eighth grader seemed almost in shock when she arrived with her grandmother and an aunt, who were furious at the girl. \"It was, like, 'You fucking idiot! You have a child in you! How did we get here?!' \" Anna said. In the living room, lights dim and blinds closed, Anna tried to ignore the tension and focus on practical details: what to expect as the abortion progressed, and what to do if complications ensued. \"If you have two regular menstrual pads and you're soaking them front to back, side to side, completely full of blood, for two hours in a row-that would be too much blood,\" she said. Across the room, Anna recalled, three sets of eyes widened. She quickly added, \"Medication abortion is very safe.\"\n\nThe eighth grader's procedure went smoothly, but the grandmother told Anna some weeks later that the girl was still depressed: \"She's just walking around in a big hoodie all the time, even though she's not pregnant anymore.\" Anna felt haunted by all she hadn't been able to do for the girl. \"In other states, or under another law system, her grandmother could have taken her to a sexual- and reproductive-health clinic, where they could have had a conversation with her, taught her about condoms, given her birth control, and sent her home feeling empowered with more information,\" she said. \"Instead, she had to go to some random person's house. I'm sure they did not feel safe or comfortable here.\"\n\nIf Anna was sometimes frustrated and uncertain, she appreciated that sensible counsel was coming from Mexico at a moment that flipped \"the narrative that America is this beacon of democracy and hope and progress.\" She had begun to see herself as part of an age-old global tradition: women helping other women with their reproductive-­health concerns because they knew they couldn't count on institutions for protection. As Gutierrez-Romine, the historian, notes, physicians began functioning as \"­gatekeepers\" for women seeking to end their pregnancies only in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn this new era of criminalized underground abortions, doctors were still occasionally required, though. One morning, Anna delivered pills to a slight woman in her thirties, a friend of a friend, who was eight weeks pregnant. When they were going over the instructions, the woman mentioned that her health had been precarious. Anna reassured her that the risk of developing an infection or hemorrhaging was low-less than one per cent in each case, studies showed. But, within an hour of taking the medication, the wom­an texted Anna that she was feeling dizzy. She'd thrown up, and her palms were itchy. She was at her parents' house, the woman told Anna, and no one there was aware that she was having an abortion. She texted Anna again shortly afterward to say that she had lost consciousness twice.\n\nPanicking, Anna advised her to rush to the nearest emergency room. Eventually, the woman confided to her mother, \"I took some pills. We're going to the hospital. And you cannot tell them that I took some pills.\" For the next four hours, Anna heard nothing. None of the tricks she used to calm herself-Wordle, Spelling Bee, mindless scrolling through her friends' feeds on Instagram-worked. She was sick with fear that the woman had died.\n\nMidafternoon, a text arrived: \"I'm stable.\" The woman explained, \"I was hooked up to all these I.V.s, so I couldn't text you. Let's go out for drinks in a couple of weeks.\"\n\nThat night, in tears, Anna told a friend, \"I don't know if I can do this anymore. I thought I had killed somebody.\" Her friend reminded her that the people who had failed this woman, and others, were the officials who had stripped them of their right to reproductive care under medical supervision.\n\nIn June, the day before Roe's overturning, the Journal of the American Medi­cal Association published an editorial warning of an imminent crisis of abortion ac­­cess, citing research indi­cating that maternal mor­tality would rise by at least twenty per cent. The authors estimated a rise of ma­­ternal mortality among Black people of upward of thirty per cent. The biennial maternal-­mortality report in Texas, due to be released last month, has been delayed until after the midterm elections.\n\nNot long ago, on a Thursday morning, a Texas woman named Sarah sat on her toilet, watching a pregnancy test develop a second red line. She was pregnant-a big problem given the complex circumstances of her life at that moment, among them the needs of the toddler daughter just outside the bathroom door. Still inside, she texted a friend for advice. The friend suggested contacting Plan C, a project that links U.S. women and abortion-pill providers around the world. Within minutes, Sarah had chosen a provider in Austria, paid a hundred and seven dollars by credit card, had a \"telehealth appointment\" with a doctor she never actually spoke to, and ordered a set of abortion pills that would be mailed to her from India. The problem was that the pills could take almost a month to get to Texas. She couldn't bear to wait that long.\n\nHer friend, concerned, was also text­ing other people. \"I might have a local contact,\" she wrote a few minutes later. By eleven-thirty that same morning, in a quiet working-class neighborhood, Anna was handing Sarah a plastic bag of pills.\n\nAfterward, Sarah's abortion complete, the toddler laid claim to the party hats a few of her mother's friends had brought over to keep her cheerful during a ­process they'd taken to calling a \"Texas miscarriage.\" (Just in case \"Zuckerberg is tracking our texts,\" Sarah said, half in jest.) Empty cans of White Claw the friends had also brought were in the recycling bin. Sometimes, Sarah grieved. She could imagine wanting a second child at a different time in her life, but she also knew that she was fortunate. Many other wo­men in states where abor­tions had been banned didn't have the support of friends like hers.\n\nWeeks later, when the package she'd ordered from India arrived and she was stowing the abortion pills in a drawer, it suddenly occurred to her that nothing but stray fear stood in the way of her doing what Anna did. She didn't know Verónica Cruz or the Old Hippies or Claire or anyone besides Anna who worked with them, but she imagined an expanding constellation of women, operating in secret and in concert, to help other women. \"Try to arrest all of us!\" Sarah said to herself. She grabbed her phone and texted Anna: \"Hey! How do I start doing what you do?\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What Ethical Health Care Looks Like When Abortion Is Criminalized\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sent the issue of abortion policy back to individual states-which has already led to a flurry of laws in red states limiting or banning women from having the procedure. Last week, I spoke to Louise Perkins King, a surgeon and bioethicist at Harvard, and the vice-chair of the ethics committee at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ). Her work focusses on the ethical obligations and quandaries faced by medical professionals; the Court's decision raises significant questions about how doctors who support abortion rights should approach their responsibilities to patients and the law going forward. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how bioethicists think about abortion, how the medical community should approach its own members who are opposed to abortion, and whether it's ever appropriate for doctors to break the law.\n\nDoes the decision to strike down Roe v. Wade change the ethical obligations of doctors in the United States?\n\nIt doesn't change our ethical obligations; it makes them more challenging, because to meet our ethical obligations, to provide abortion-which is health care-in some states physicians will be facing criminal and financial penalties. And, from a utilitarian standpoint, if you meet your ethical obligations and ignore the law and risk those criminal and financial penalties, it may be that you're then no longer available to treat other patients. Figuring out how to thread that needle is difficult, as is figuring out when you can legally treat women who are pregnant, if they're facing various emergencies, because it is very difficult to know what you can and cannot do.\n\nBefore this decision, the majority of states in the country had some legal restrictions on abortion. How were those existing restrictions-which often limit abortion in the third trimester-balanced with the ethical obligation to provide health care?\n\nMy personal opinion is that many of the legislative approaches to abortion that existed were inappropriate. The actual legislation that we have in Massachusetts-the one that I support, and I'm very glad that we have here-is called the ROE Act, and it allows for abortion up to twenty-four weeks. After that time frame, meaning essentially in the third trimester, abortion is still permitted when necessary to save the life of a person who's pregnant or in the setting of lethal anomalies or anomalies not compatible with life. That allows meaningful access to abortion, the meaningful exercise of people's rights to bodily autonomy, and a meaningful interaction with teams of doctors, midwives, and other health-care professionals who can help people reach decisions on these matters and who can help determine in that third trimester when abortion is truly necessary-which is exceptionally rare but sometimes important.\n\nOne of the criticisms of Roe was that it set standards that were somewhat arbitrary, including the trimester divisions. Ethically, why would the third trimester be different from the first one?\n\nThat's a great question. This concept of viability, which is, from a medical standpoint, an ever-changing and fluid concept-it can't possibly serve as a line in the sand. The trimester system is just something that is divided into threes, but any particular pregnancy might not correspond to those time frames, might not follow those patterns. There are innumerable complexities that come up in a pregnancy that might lead to different decision-making and different needs at different times.\n\nAs an ethicist, I think that there shouldn't be these lines in the sand. There's been a dearth of deference to medical expertise, dating back to Gonzales v. Carhart , where they're simply ignoring what anybody who practices this type of medicine is trying to say. It's complicated. I can understand the desire for these lines in the sand from both legislators and the public, but that's not an ethical way to move forward on such a complex issue.\n\nWhen you sit down with anyone who really wants to create some firm boundaries around abortion because they feel they have to, and then you start explaining to them how complicated things can become, if you're dealing with severe hydrocephalus, severe cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes, eclampsia, preeclampsia, hemorrhage-and I could go on-all of these nuances of the various complications and difficulties that arise in pregnancy don't lend themselves to lines in the sand. From an ethics perspective, there really shouldn't be very many legislative, if any, restrictions on abortion, personally. That's my view. We should have very clear training for all of our providers and for the public about why that should be the case, whether we can achieve it or not. But a good way to achieve essentially that is what we have in Massachusetts through the ROE Act.\n\nWhat I'm trying to understand from what you just said is whether the reason a legislative approach to this issue is bad is that pregnancy is really complicated, and you can't just have a blunt instrument addressing it-or, instead, that a woman should be able to do what she wants with her body. Whatever medical issues she may be having, or whatever complications there are medically, those are not that important to you as an ethicist, because it's her body and she can do what she wants.\n\nI'll preface again and say these are my personal views. In terms of a pregnant person's right to bodily autonomy-in my personal opinion, that is absolute. And so I don't ask reasons if somebody, for example, is asking for an abortion earlier on in pregnancy. As you get further along in pregnancy, things become more complicated. I don't know if I would feel comfortable performing a third-trimester abortion for a patient where, if that infant was born, it would probably survive, and the person in front of me is saying, \"I just don't want to be pregnant now.\" That would be a little bit difficult.\n\nThere are gradations, and there are points at which a pregnant person's right to bodily autonomy can be called into question. The difficulty that arises for me personally is that if I say no to any abortion, I'm saying to someone, \"I think that your right to make a decision about the risk that you wish to take, about the risk of death that you wish to face, is no longer your right.\" That's a statement I don't think I could make, either. If someone came to me and said, \"You are the only match for a kidney, or for bone marrow, or name your body part, for my daughter,\" I would have an absolute choice of whether or not I wished to donate that fundamental tissue to her.\n\nIn those instances, the risks that I would incur, even if I were having a kidney removed or a portion of my lung or liver removed, are less than when I carried my daughter to term and delivered her. Even after my death, I can refuse to let you use any of those organs to help a family member or anybody else. And yet, if I'm pregnant, at a certain point in time, depending on which legislation you're looking at, you will be able to say to me, \"You no longer have the right to manage the risks for your body, to manage the risks of passing a grown infant through the vaginal canal, the risks of tearing, prolapse, sexual dysfunction, hemorrhage, and death. You no longer get to control whether you're going to take those risks or not.\"\n\nObviously, if I'm sitting in front of somebody who is in the very early stages of pregnancy, this question is very simple for me. In the early stages of a pregnancy, if they don't wish to take on those risks, a hundred per cent, they have an absolute right to bodily autonomy in those decisions. If we're getting into later stages of pregnancy, it becomes quite complex, but really that's almost a red herring, because it just doesn't happen. Even with the incredible lack of access that we have in this country to sexual education and contraception, women are not presenting for elective termination in their third trimester. So that question doesn't happen, and, because it doesn't, as an ethicist, even though I find a lot of difficulty in that space, in my analysis, I don't actually have to answer that question. It becomes a red herring, because it constantly does get brought up, even though it's not really the true issue. It's an interesting, difficult question to grapple with, but it just doesn't happen.\n\nI assume you want medical professionals to have a certain amount of autonomy to make their own decisions, and you don't want them questioning every decision, because then the whole system would break. I'm curious how you think about what role doctors have in making their own decisions about whether they are going to do specific abortion procedures.\n\nIt's a really tough one. Each individual physician obviously needs to be able to govern what they feel comfortable doing. But when that discomfort impedes access to care for so many people in our country, we've let the pendulum of professional autonomy swing too far. In the United States, only twelve to fourteen per cent of ob-gyns provide abortion care, and that's not O.K. We need to have a workforce of obstetrics and gynecology professionals who are not only trained but willing to conscientiously provide this care. And that we don't is a failing of our professional obligation. So you're right. I would never say to any individual provider, \"You must provide this care.\" But when I speak to medical students who are thinking about these questions and trying to figure out where they want to go in their careers, I encourage them to think carefully about their duty, not only as individuals but as members of a group of people providing care.\n\nIf they really feel that they cannot provide abortion care, there are many ways to be an excellent women's-health physician without compromising the access to care for women. It does involve all of us working together. My point of view on this is slightly different from many of my colleagues who provide abortion care. I have to say that, over the years, they're wearing me down a little bit. The reason I say that is because my position is typically the majority position of most institutions like ACOG -that conscientious objection is appropriate, that we need a professional society to insure we have enough access, but that certain individual physicians could conscientiously object to provide the care.\n\nBut that puts an enormous burden on those who do provide the care. And, in this country, that puts a burden on them that includes not being able to disclose their work to people, or their home addresses. I have one colleague who is very circumspect about what she does for a living, because she doesn't want to put her children at risk. Their lives can be on the line, given the violence that has occurred. If that's where this is going, then, at the end of the day, I'm starting to come around to the opinion that, as a professional society, we simply can no longer accommodate what I still would defend ethically: conscientious objection.\n\nCan you say more about the real-world manifestation of the difference of opinion you have with the people in your field? What are they arguing?\n\nThey might not all believe this, but many of them who have spoken to me have shared that they do not think that you should match into obstetrics and gynecology if you are conscientiously opposed to providing abortion care. It's a fundamental portion of our training. It's a fundamental portion of the care that we provide to patients. So, if that's your strong belief, there are many other opportunities in medicine. There's no reason for somebody who conscientiously opposes the provision of abortion care to go into a discipline in which that care should be a fundamental part.\n\nI've never held that view, because it's important that we have varied viewpoints within our disciplines, and that we are open to hearing challenges. But when those different viewpoints cross into wholesale removal of rights from half our population, or violence against those who are providing the care, or obstructing care, as is happening in so many different states, then the balance of how we address the issue of conscientious objection has to change. I've been slowly modifying my view. I don't know where I stand.\n\nJust to clarify, when you said that people were wearing you down, you didn't mean irritating you-you meant making you think hard about this question and its many complications.\n\nI meant bringing me around to their viewpoint.\n\nYou broached something earlier that I want to come back to. A doctor may choose not to follow an unethical or immoral law. One of the problems with not following laws, even if they're bad laws, is that they create all these other second- and third-order utilitarian consequences that can be really, really problematic-which is why, broadly speaking, people should not evaluate every single law every second of the day and just broadly follow the law. I think that's what most ethicists would say.\n\nTrue.\n\nCan you talk more about this problem?\n\nSure. The laws in various states are all slightly different, but, at the end of the day, they're going to put doctors in a position of deciding when a woman is sick enough for them to intervene, and that's incredibly difficult to figure out. Sepsis, for example, proceeds very slowly until it doesn't, and then it kills. That's the story that happened with Savita Halappanavar in Ireland. The law moves very slowly in its clarification process, through things happening, cases going forward, and then courts deciding whether something was legal or not legal. In the moment, when you're sitting in front of someone who may be dying , and you're being told that it might be illegal to help them, that's not a moment when you can rely on the law to give you guidance.\n\nA physician faced with somebody in exactly Savita's situation of sepsis-but with electrical activity [in the fetus] and not being able to proceed forward with the termination that would save her life-might go through with that procedure and then, if they're prosecuted, go through years of the legal process, of trying to figure out if they've broken the law or not. During that time, they might not be able to provide care meaningfully to other patients because they're consumed with defending themselves in court.\n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, they're going to have to adhere as closely to the law as they can and see if they can pinpoint that moment when the life of the patient is truly in danger under the laws that would not allow intervention otherwise. That's an impossible place to be put in. The moral injury that will ensue for these physicians is equally damaging. We are seeing physicians and midwives leave practice, nurses leave practice, because of all the moral injuries that have happened over the course of our pandemic. This will still surely add to that problem, so we are going to have fewer and fewer people providing care.\n\nWhat else from a bioethical point of view have you been thinking about since the decision came down?\n\nA lot of stuff, but the main thing I would share with you is that there's been a lot of talk about how we move on from here. I have a lot of conversations with people who disagree with me, especially students, but also other ethicists, and frequently those discussions are very fruitful. I have an honest respect for people who come to their belief that abortion is morally fraught. I believe them, that they really honestly believe that. What I've found has been problematic in discussions of late and has led me to be a bit more circumspect is just a callousness that I hadn't fully appreciated before-this callousness of, \"Well, this decision is a good thing because it will save lives.\"\n\nIt must come from a place of simply not understanding all the complexities, because we know from very clear statistics that many people will die because of this decision. And so there are all these calls for constructive discussion and being open, but we can only move forward if people on all sides of this topic will accept the clear facts that are established and can be looked up in the W.H.O. or in The New England Journal [ of Medicine ]. This will lead to death and severe morbidity. We have to start from that spot and not be debating that any longer, and then figure out where we're going to go from there. ♦\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Roe's Final Hours in One of America's Largest Abortion Clinics\n\nAt seven o'clock on Friday morning, Ivy turned on the lights of the Houston Women's Clinic, the largest abortion provider in the state, where she has worked as a supervisor for nearly two decades. Since May, when the draft of a Supreme Court decision leaked , revealing its conservative majority's intention to overturn Roe v. Wade, Ivy, who is fifty-six and asked to be identified only by a nickname, went to work each day knowing that it might be her last. But neither the likely end of a woman's right to an abortion , nor Texas's existing onerous regulations against it, had altered her brisk morning habits. Tucking her graying, hip-length hair into a bun and covering it with a black surgical cap, she sterilized all the syringes, counted the curettes one by one, and waited for her colleagues to trickle in. Only Ivy's message to her patients had changed. Now every greeting had to come with a disclaimer.\n\nA ruling on Roe v. Wade was imminent and the procedure could be banned at any time, Ivy would warn the pregnant women who approached the front desk, after the perfunctory good mornings. Friday, patients began arriving at eight o'clock, having negotiated picketers who were working the parking lot. \"Let me see your I.D., mija ,\" Ivy said to the first woman to reach the light-filled lobby, where a large fish tank was murmuring away. The woman, dressed in black pants and a gray hoodie, was assigned a patient number to protect her privacy. Only four weeks along, she, like the vast majority of the morning's patients, was coming for her second of two visits. As mandated by Texas law, women have to wait at least twenty-four hours after receiving paperwork and a sonogram that confirms their pregnancies. Now she was returning in hopes of having a second sonogram and then the abortion. To the right of the desk where Ivy checked her in was a framed proclamation, signed by the mayor of Houston, honoring the forty-fourth anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat day, despite Ivy's warnings, only a few women at the front desk seemed to register that their access to abortion was in jeopardy. The dominant concern was whether the ultrasound would determine that they were more than six weeks pregnant or had electrical activity in fetal cells-eventualities that, following the passage of a state law last September, would mean they'd be barred from receiving an abortion in Texas and need to seek care in a different state.\n\nOne by one, women were called into the back of the clinic to receive their ultrasounds and counselling sessions, or to await the doctor, who had not yet appeared. A row of stiff wooden chairs where they bided their time faced a framed photograph of Portofino's cerulean bay. As the women stared at the Italian village, or their phones, a dozen anxious staff members huddled by the front desk. One of the medical assistants placed her phone against a stack of patient files so that her colleagues could see the Supreme Court's schedule for the day. A nurse started braiding the receptionist's brightly dyed hair. Ivy's boss, Sheila, who directs the clinic, had been in touch with lawyers at the A.C.L.U. \"It can come any minute,\" she told her colleagues of the decision, adding with a nervous smile, \"My sister is trying to distract me. She just sent me an article: 'How to Stop Dating People Who Are Wrong for You.' \" Someone yelled from another room: \"Send it to me!\"\n\nDespite the tension, for the next hour, the workers tried to focus on their particular responsibilities, including answering the phone, which rang constantly. The faster they worked, the more patients they could ready to see the doctor, who would either give the eligible women pills to begin a medication abortion or proceed with a surgical one. But at 9:11 A.M. , before the doctor had walked through the door and any abortions had commenced, Sheila heard  from an A.C.L.U. lawyer. \"Roe, overturned,\" she said flatly. Ivy, emerging from the lab, hadn't caught Sheila's exact words, but she understood them when she saw her hands shaking.\n\nFor a few seconds, no one said a word. Ivy retreated to an area of the clinic where women's vitals were taken and a urine sample awaited analysis. Alone, she pressed her fingers to her welling eyes. Other workers wrapped their arms around one another. Confused, one of the patients left her seat and interrupted their silence. \"Why are y'all crying?\" she asked. Sheila, trying to collect herself, wiped her tears away and turned to the woman and three other patients in the waiting room. \"Ladies, I'm so sorry to tell you that the law for abortion has been overturned,\" she said. \"We are not able to perform any abortions at this time, but that doesn't mean that you don't have an option, O.K.?\"\n\nTwo of the patients, wearing bright fluffy slippers, stared into space, speechless. A third, who wore black horn-rimmed glasses, burst into sobs. The fourth, who spoke no English, asked, \" Qué pasó ?\" Sheila kneeled by her side, and, in broken Spanish, said, \" No podemos hacerlo ahora ,\" meaning \"We can't do it now.\" The woman, who was of Cuban origin, had no reaction, so Sheila asked Ivy to do a better translation. \"Mi amor, the Supreme Court just ruled that abortion is banned in Texas,\" she said in Spanish. \"We cannot assist you.\" The woman froze, in disbelief.\n\nIvy handed her a leaflet with the National Abortion Federation's phone number and urged her to call it to learn about options in other states. The leaflet was in English. The guidance it contained included contact details of three abortion funds, two of which had immediately ceased operations upon announcement of the ruling. \"They don't do it in Texas anymore?\" the woman asked, her eyes widening. Ivy shook her head, resting her hand on the woman's shoulder.\n\nOver and over again, Ivy conveyed the same message to two dozen other women who had been waiting to see the doctor. She could share the results of the ultrasounds the women had just done, but the clinic was unable to perform the procedure that they'd come for. \"Abortion, no more,\" Ivy told one woman sitting in the lobby, eyes down. In her distress, her perfect fluency in two languages seemed to disappear, momentarily, but then she gathered herself. \"You're gonna call them,\" Ivy said, handing over the now outdated leaflet while fighting back her own tears, \"and they're gonna guide you, O.K.?\"\n\nSome patients fled the clinic the moment that they heard the news. When Ivy called their numbers to offer what little advice she could give, there was silence. Sheila felt especially pained by a woman whose previous medication abortion had failed and who had come back that morning believing that, this time, the treatment would work. Other patients simply refused to accept the news and leave the clinic. One of them clasped Ivy's arm and would not let go. \"Please help me,\" she whispered, offering to give her a stash of money in exchange for abortion pills. \"We can't do it,\" Ivy insisted. \"It's against the law.\" The woman begged her: she would take the pills at home-no one would have to know. \"Your husband has to take you to another state,\" Ivy said, her tone severe. \"Abortion is not legal.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, when Ivy entered an exam room, a woman named Brittany, twenty-two, was perched on the table, her white T-shirt wrinkled and hands clenched. She had come for a follow-up appointment, a week after her abortion, and had already heard the news.  She was chilled by how close she'd come to being kept from the procedure and having \"this target on your back.\" Could she now get in trouble for having had an abortion a week ago, she asked Ivy. You haven't done anything illegal, Ivy assured her, but suggested it would probably be better for her if she didn't tell other people about her abortion.\n\nWhen the last patient of the morning left, the clinic's reception area turned into a kind of mission control. Ivy began storing patient records in boxes while two of her colleagues tried to call women who had appointments that afternoon to tell them not to come. Other staffers struggled to understand how the decision would impact their livelihoods. Business in the clinic would vanish, and it wasn't hard to figure that they'd all be losing their jobs. \"There are two laws,\" Sheila said to one of the nurses, going off of what the lawyers had told her. \"There is a pre-Roe, 1960 law, in the Constitution, and then there's a trigger law,\" she said, describing various Texas laws. Texas's attorney general threatened to enforce the former immediately. The latter would take effect thirty days after the Court's judgment and make it a felony to provide an abortion.\n\nBefore long, the afternoon's patients started showing up, despite the voice mails that workers had been leaving. Every time the door alarm chimed, staff members turned in unison to the front entrance, their faces drawn. \"I'm not sure if you've heard the news,\" the receptionist told a woman who seemed on the brink of tears. Another patient arrived and, baffled, asked Sheila what the law was now. \"Since Roe v. Wade has been overturned, it goes back to each state making the decision,\" she explained. \"So, obviously, we live in a conservative state and it becomes illegal.\" Around her, Sheila's colleagues were already starting to refer to Roe in the past tense, as if evoking some distant era in which abortion had been a right.\n\nDuring a momentary lull in patient traffic, Sheila sank back against a cabinet to rest. \"We can fall down now,\" she told the others. A staffer in her sixties named Linda, who had been working at the clinic for forty-two years, respectfully disagreed. She remembered the years when picketers would break into the clinic with stink bombs or flood the premises with hoses through the front door's mail slot-often enough that drain holes had been drilled into the clinic floor. \"If you fall down,\" Linda said, in a grave voice, \"they'll walk right over you.\"\n\nThe clinic's eighty-year-old doctor, Bernard Rosenfeld, had stayed away from the clinic that morning, worrying that even showing up after the decision came down might expose him to state prosecution. But he couldn't stay away for long, and in the early afternoon arrived to console his staff. Like Linda, he remembered the old days of abortion all too well. He'd attended medical school in the late nineteen-sixties and early seventies, before Roe legalized abortion in 1973. \"We were routinely trying to save women from septic abortion and hemorrhage,\" he said, of his years at Boston City Hospital. \"It was a disaster.\" Rosenfeld then took an internship at Los Angeles County-U.S.C. Medical Center, and in 1975 became the primary whistle-blower on a case of forced sterilization inside the hospital. Hundreds of Latina women were asked to sign papers consenting to tubal ligation in the midst of labor. Some women weren't even aware that they had been sterilized until a civil-rights lawyer who was working with Rosenfeld came knocking on their door.\n\nRosenfeld eventually joined the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, becoming a specialist in tubal reversal, and, in the early eighties, taking charge of the clinic in the center of town. The  day before the Court decision, he, Ivy, and Sheila had sat in the plush leather armchairs where patients usually rest after surgical abortions, debating what would happen after the ruling. All three of them wondered where the law would end. Would it impact fertility treatments? Would I.V.F. still be legal? And what would the implications be for genetic research? Just as worrying to Rosenfeld was the fact that younger generations of doctors were shying away from the practice. For years, he had been unable to find a physician to replace him. \"I never thought I would retire so early,\" he said, flashing a bitter smile. He'd been feeling the pressure of state regulations to stop performing abortions for some time. When the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, ordered all such clinics to shut down during the pandemic, Rosenfeld was summoned before the Texas Medical Board and accused of disobeying state orders. He was eventually found innocent, but feared he'd be similarly scrutinized and challenged by state officials post-Roe. \"You need to stop immediately, or else they're coming after you,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, after the decision, Ivy and Sheila took a moment away from the patients to grab some duct tape and go outside. They needed to put up a large poster that the doctor's wife had made the day before. It read \"HWC is no longer able to provide abortion care.\" Ivy enlisted the clinic's security guard in the effort. \"Juan!\" she said. \" Los abortos ya no son legales \"-abortions are no longer legal. The guard, a thin man of sixty, who has been serving the clinic for fourteen years,  was too busy locating a drill to fully process the news that he'd be out of work.  All three of them climbed on a bench beneath an existing sign that read \"WE ♥ HWC.\" As Juan loosened the screws, the sign dropped to the ground, its fasteners tumbling behind it.\n\nInside, a decision that had been in the air for months was suddenly concrete: after more than forty years, the clinic would be closing. On the phone with one of the medical assistants, a pregnant woman screamed furiously, before dropping the phone, \"I guess I'll just have to take matters into my own hands, won't I?\" The clinic's counsellors knew of patients who had thrown themselves down a flight of stairs or had seriously contemplated suicide. \"We'll see more babies in the dumpsters,\" Lupe, another medical assistant, said. She was most worried about the women who could not travel out of state and Latina patients she had treated throughout the years, some of whom were illiterate. With the staff at the clinic gone, who would pass on information about alternatives now?\n\nLingering in the parking lot, uncertain, was the Cuban woman who had earlier been given a leaflet that listed options she couldn't read. As she left the clinic, a picketer named Raúl had tried to lure her into a large bus that could take her to the Houston Coalition for Life, which he referred to as a \"medical center,\" but she decided to walk past him. \"I can't keep the child. I already have three,\" she said, adding that they were aged two, four, and eight. The woman was five weeks into her pregnancy. \"Why would they do this?\" she said of the Court. The woman said that she couldn't afford to travel to another state. Even the fund that was meant to pay for her abortion that day had gone dark. But she was convinced that she would find a way. A friend of hers had told her about a Mexican man who could go to her home and perform the procedure. \"She told me that, if things didn't work out at the clinic, I could always call him,\" she said hopefully, looking straight at the closed clinic door. ♦\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What the End of Roe v. Wade Will Mean for the Next Generation of Obstetricians\n\nFor a long time, Cara Buskmiller has known two things about herself: she wants to deliver babies, and she is called by her faith to a lifetime of virginity. Growing up in nineteen-nineties Dallas with six younger siblings, Buskmiller knew a little about pregnancy and birth, and was interested in medicine. But she truly decided on obstetrics in the seventh grade, after touring an ob-gyn's office with her Girl Scout troop. She saw posters promoting contraception on every wall-something her parents, devout Catholics, had taught her was wrong-and she thought, Oh, my gosh, I have to become an OB to combat this!\n\nHer second vocation took longer to discern. She tried dating in college, carefully considering all the eligible Catholic men she knew, but no one felt like an obvious match. She flirted with the Catholic Church's version of a sorority rush for nuns, visiting convents and chatting with sisters to see whether that should be her path. But it turned out that the answer was in her own family: her great aunt Marjorie, a former teacher, was a consecrated virgin, dedicated to chastity and obedience while also able to pursue an independent professional life. Today, Buskmiller is unfazed by questions about why a professed virgin would specialize in a field of medicine that's all about sex. \"Doesn't God have a sense of humor?\" she asked, chuckling.\n\nBut in 2010, as Buskmiller prepared to apply to medical school, she worried that admissions committees would be skeptical of her beliefs, and how her personal objections to abortion and birth control would affect her practice as an ob-gyn. What would program directors think of the volunteer stints she'd done at a crisis pregnancy center? And, when it came time for residency, would she be able to duck out of certain clinical rotations to avoid assisting with abortions?\n\nBuskmiller got into medical school at Texas A. & M., and she went on to do her residency at St. Louis University, a Catholic school. But she felt that students like her needed more backup. So, during her second year as a resident, she launched a Web site called Conscience in Residency, a support network for doctors-in-training who have moral objections to abortion. The site's tagline is \"You're not crazy, and you're not alone.\" Buskmiller maintains a crowdsourced spreadsheet where residency candidates note which institutions made them feel welcome-and which ones didn't. An \"abortion 'mecca,' \" someone commented about Oregon Health & Science University, in Portland: \"Two faculty members stated directly in medical student lectures that they think anyone holding a conscientious objection to abortion should reconsider if it's ethical to be an ob-gyn.\" Another commenter wrote, of Southern Illinois University, in Springfield, that the program director \"seemed very shocked when I asked about opting out of sterilizations.\" Most of the residents, the commenter added, \"are very involved in 'abortion advocacy.' \"\n\nEven in an era when Roe v. Wade looks likely to be overturned , residents who describe themselves as pro-life are countercultural within their field. They believe that fetuses are human persons with moral status; when Buskmiller encounters a woman in even the earliest stages of pregnancy, she sees two patients, not one. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG , on the other hand, firmly maintains that abortion is a form of health care and supports the right of a patient to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability. Progressive physicians and students argue that abortion access is not just crucial for their patients' health but for a more economically and racially just society. They believe that abortion can help keep families out of poverty and that it protects the lives of Black women, who, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are three times as likely as white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. Meanwhile, residency-program directors may hesitate when they encounter students who decline to participate in abortion training, which involves learning how to care for patients in emergencies as well as before and after the procedure. Even doctors who don't perform abortions are likely to encounter patients who have had them. Knowing more about that experience makes them better practitioners, Jody Steinauer, an ob-gyn professor at the University of California, San Francisco (U.C.S.F.), said.\n\nStill, there's a surprising amount of subtle variation among how people in the medical community think about this issue. All students and young doctors have to sort out questions of how they want to practice medicine; aspiring ob-gyns' views on abortion might determine what training they seek out, which specialities they pursue, and where they choose to live. In a post-Roe world , that self-sorting process would grow even more intense: in roughly half the country, abortion would be all but illegal, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive-rights think tank. Medical residents in those states would likely have to go elsewhere to learn about abortions, just as patients would have to travel to get the procedure. In the other half of the country, demand for abortions would almost certainly shoot up, putting pressure on physicians, hospitals, and clinics to serve patients from out of state. For all doctors and trainees, no matter their views, this geographic divide could pose dilemmas-even for anti-abortion students who would presumably welcome the reversal of Roe. Simple slogans and tidy categories are useful for politics but not for medicine. \"Pro-life people do not understand why gynecologists talk about the need for abortion until they see a woman dying in front of their eyes because they're pregnant,\" Buskmiller said. \"I think it's possible to be pro-life, in spite of those situations. But we can't have rose-colored glasses and think the situation is easy. It is not.\"\n\nDoctors haven't always seen abortion as a form of health care. The text of Roe v. Wade hints at the differences among physicians in the early seventies; the Supreme Court took it for granted that some doctors would object to abortion for either moral or religious reasons. Feminist scholars have noted that the Justices seemed just as preoccupied with physicians' rights as they were with women's rights. \"The abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician,\" Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in the opinion of the Court.\n\nAround the time that the Court was assessing the case, however, a hundred doctors signed a letter advocating a new, patient-centered approach to health care. \"It will be necessary for physicians to realize that abortion has become a predominantly social as well as medical responsibility,\" they wrote. \"For the first time . . . doctors will be expected to do an operation simply because the patient asks that it be done.\" They were arguing for a new way of thinking about medicine: at least when it comes to pregnancy, doctors shouldn't be the deciders. Patients should.\n\nIt took many years for medical schools and health institutions to adopt this attitude. In the decades after Roe, \"contraception was not considered to be a training topic worthy of an ob-gyn,\" Eve Espey, the chair of the ob-gyn department at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, told me. \"Abortion was just taboo. It was felt to be an activity that was dominated by older men for a profit motive.\" Even by 1992, just twelve per cent of ob-gyn residency programs included training on abortion procedures.\n\nIn the early nineties, however, a major shift began-one led, in part, by students. In 1993, when Steinauer was a medical student at U.C.S.F., she founded an organization called Medical Students for Choice, with the goal of expanding abortion access. Many doctors who had started practicing before Roe, Steinauer told me, provided abortions out of necessity: they had seen women die and were committed to preventing that from happening again. \"I would say my generation started thinking about it a little differently,\" she said. \"It was a little more activist- and advocacy-oriented.\" They didn't want a woman's right to an abortion to be merely theoretical.\n\nThe best way to expand access to abortions, Steinauer believed, was to train more doctors to perform them. She and her fellow-students began lobbying the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to make training on elective abortions mandatory for ob-gyn residency programs, and in 1995 this became the standard-all residents had to learn about abortion. But the next year, after pushback from Catholic hospitals and other groups, Congress passed an amendment to a public-health law, prohibiting discrimination against medical-training programs that refused to teach abortion procedures. The amendment underlined a growing tension in the field: legally, no one could be forced to perform abortions. But, culturally, pro-choice voices were growing louder within the world of obstetrics, arguing that abortion is a necessary part of reproductive health care.\n\nIn 1999, Susan Thompson Buffett, the wife of the multibillionaire Warren Buffett, bankrolled a new initiative called the Ryan Residency Training Program, which provided funding, curriculum help, and other resources to residency programs that teach abortion procedures. When I spoke with Steinauer, the director, she said that, as the program became more widely known, students who were serious about family planning began asking about Ryan rotations in their residency interviews: \"They saw it as a core part of their identity as ob-gyn physicians.\" (A sister program, RHEDI , also provides family-medicine programs with resources to train residents about abortion.) Now, if a medical student wants to focus on providing abortions, she can choose from more than a hundred programs that follow the Ryan model, which has been adopted by roughly a third of ob-gyn residency programs. She'll learn how to counsel patients on birth control and medication that can induce abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy, and, at some point in her training, she'll likely perform dilation and evacuation on patients in their second trimester of pregnancy, a process that involves opening a woman's cervix and removing the fetus. If the student wants to learn how to perform abortions on patients in complex medical situations, including those who are far along in their pregnancies, she can pursue a fellowship in complex family planning-a specialty that became fully accredited only two years ago.\n\nAnd yet, even now, with the Ryan program in full force and Roe still in place, a remarkably small portion of doctors perform abortions. In a 2019 survey, published by the ACOG 's journal, just twenty-four per cent of ob-gyns reported performing the procedure. (In some states, nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, and physician assistants can also provide abortions, most commonly by medication.) Another ten to twenty per cent of doctors reported that they would be willing to provide abortions and have the training to do so-but cannot, owing to hospital policies or regulations on abortion medication. Others simply don't want abortion to be part of their medical life.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly how many medical students and residents would describe themselves as pro-life. Surveys of Ryan residents indicate that nineteen per cent opt out of certain aspects of their family-planning training, but this doesn't account for residents at other schools, some of whom have deliberately self-selected away from programs that follow the Ryan model. (On Buskmiller's spreadsheet, these programs are carefully flagged.)\n\nAshley Womack-a friend of Buskmiller's from high school-knew that she wanted to opt out of abortion training when she was applying for residency programs, in 2014. She purposely avoided programs in liberal states; she ended up accepting an offer from the medical center at the University of Texas, Austin, where program leaders assured her that they wouldn't make her do anything she didn't want to do. Womack, who is Catholic and now works in private practice in Dallas, won't perform abortions or sterilizations. (Her personal Web site indicates that her practice follows the Catholic Church's directives on health care.) Although she'll counsel patients on their birth-control options, she won't prescribe the pill or place intrauterine devices for contraceptive purposes. She told me that, when she was considering which field of medicine to pursue, she felt called to \"be a pro-life voice\" in obstetrics. Surveys show that roughly half of Americans consider themselves pro-life, she reasoned: \"Why would it not make sense to have ob-gyns who are reflective of the population?\" But, entering the field, she quickly discovered that this was not a popular view. \"You need to work extra hard to be an excellent resident,\" she told me. \"That's how I felt the entire time-I need to be perfect so the only thing they can complain about is that I don't do these things.\"\n\nSoon after Womack started her residency, the program requirements changed: family-planning rotations at Planned Parenthood became mandatory. Womack knew a couple of residents whose requests not to go had been declined. So, uneasy, she showed up for her first day. The experience was upsetting: in her view, the medical staff didn't fully counsel patients on options other than abortion. When Womack made it clear that she wasn't going to assist with performing abortions, she was sent to the recovery room to clean chairs and hand out crackers.\n\nDuring my reporting, several sources suggested that aspiring obstetricians who object to abortion should find another line of work. Meg Autry, who until recently directed the residency program at U.C.S.F., told me that many physicians who support abortion rights, particularly those who are active in family planning, feel this way. Buskmiller, who is now a maternal-fetal-medicine fellow at the U.T. Health Science Center at Houston and wants to specialize in fetal surgery, has taken a professional interest in the antagonism she perceives toward students and residents in obstetrics who don't want to perform abortions. In 2021, she co-authored a paper published in The Linacre Quarterly, a Catholic medical journal, finding that roughly a quarter of residency-program directors expressed strong negative reactions to residency candidates who say that they won't perform abortions. (They had much stronger reactions to other kinds of refusals, such as counselling or prescribing birth control.) \"If an applicant can't fulfill the basic duties of our program . . . it doesn't matter how excellent they are otherwise,\" one director wrote. \"No one can reasonably hire a quadrapelgic police officer, even if they passed the written test with a perfect score.\" It seems like this mentality will become more widespread if Roe is overturned and access to abortion training is even more limited than it is now. \"When everyone has to be trained, then you have the luxury of saying, 'Oh, let's make sure we have a diversity of opinion so we can make the conversation broader and more robust,' \" Autry said.\n\nIn the absolutist world of social media, the end of Roe may intensify existing conflicts between medical students who are for and against abortion. After we spoke, Buskmiller passed along screenshots of a Twitter dustup from a couple of years ago, in which a medical student got more than seven hundred likes for expressing outrage at a first-year man at her school who wanted to start a pro-life student organization: \"Pro-life anything has NO PLACE in a medical school.\" These are the little signals that make young doctors like Buskmiller unsure of their place in the field. \"You can skate through pretty easily if you remain quiet, and if your choices . . . don't end up on Twitter,\" she said.\n\nAnd yet, throughout much of the U.S., students, residents, and doctors have already been living and working alongside people whose views differ from their own. For these physicians, division over abortion is just a part of life. When Mallory Vial, a medical student who grew up in a small, conservative city in Mississippi, arrived at the U.T. Health Science Center at Houston, she expected the other students and aspiring OBs to be interested in learning about pregnancy termination-or at least engaged on the abortion issue. But \"it's been such a mixed bag,\" she told me. During the spring of her first year, she became the president of the campus chapter of Medical Students for Choice. The biggest challenge she faced was apathy. \"Most people in our class and at our school are more in the middle and kind of staying out of the debate,\" she told me. \"When there's confrontation, they don't really think it applies to them.\"\n\nTo her surprise, Vial often found more in common with members of Physicians for Life, the anti-abortion student group, than with her other classmates. At least they cared. \"When we're having these conversations, we disagree, so there is conflict, quote-unquote,\" she said. \"But it's also productive-and I think good-to see that there is diversity of opinion. . . . There's no reason for medicine to be a monolith on this issue.\" She'd attend Physicians for Life lectures and collaborate with the group on events.\n\nAs Vial was deciding where to apply for residency last fall, she debated whether to stay in Texas or pursue her education in another state. She knows that she eventually wants to practice medicine in the South-it's where she feels most connected to patients, she said-but getting comprehensive abortion training in the region won't be possible if the Court overturns Roe, since most Southern states will likely ban the procedure at six weeks into a pregnancy or even earlier. Despite applying to programs in various states, Vial ended up matching at the same center in Houston where she went to medical school. (Vial, along with Buskmiller and other doctors I spoke with, emphasized that her views are her own, not a reflection of her medical school or residency program.)\n\nIn some ways, Vial is typical of her generation's progressive, abortion-supporting ob-gyn medical students. She firmly believes that the procedure should be legal and accessible, and is determined to get family-planning training in residency. She sees political advocacy as an integral part of what it means to be a doctor; she feels obligated to improve not just patients' health but the systems in which they live. In other ways, she's had to grapple with the future of her field before the rest of her cohort. If Roe falls, abortion will no longer be a question that ob-gyn students and residents can ignore. It won't be a question that any doctor can ignore.\n\nHow will medical students and residents figure out their approach to abortion in a world without Roe? Depending on where in the country they live, maybe they'll perform first-trimester abortions but nothing later in pregnancy. Maybe they'll pick a speciality in which abortion doesn't come up. Or maybe they'll pursue advanced training to perform abortions at twenty weeks or later in a pregnancy. Research suggests that obstetricians already set personal limits based on the circumstances of the abortion: in one study, about a third of ob-gyns said that they wouldn't help a woman with five daughters terminate after she found out she was pregnant with another healthy girl, for example, whereas nearly all the respondents said that they'd aid a woman with cardiopulmonary disease who might die during pregnancy.\n\nBut, if Roe is overturned, it will become that much harder for new doctors to navigate these messy boundaries-to learn how to treat real human beings with complicated stories and difficult situations. Lisa Harris, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan, wrote a paper in 2008 describing the experience of performing an abortion while she was about eighteen weeks pregnant on a patient who was roughly as far along. \"With my first pass of the forceps, I grasped an extremity and began to pull it down. I could see a small foot hanging from the teeth of my forceps. With a quick tug, I separated the leg. Precisely at that moment, I felt a kick-a fluttery 'thump, thump' in my own uterus,\" she wrote. She began crying, as though a message had been sent from \"my hand and my uterus to my tear ducts,\" a response \"unmediated by my training or my feminist pro-choice politics.\" It's unusual to hear this kind of story about abortion; \"frank talk like this is threatening to abortion rights,\" she wrote. But doctors like Harris have learned to reconcile multiple conflicting truths: \"I respect a woman's request to end a pregnancy, which I understand as a request to help shape the course of her life. And I understand that a person won't be born because of that,\" she wrote in a 2019 op-ed .\n\nWitnessing abortion up close can change the minds of those who are uncomfortable with the procedure, too. One female Ryan program participant in the Northeast wrote on a follow-up survey that seeing the circumstances of an elective abortion late in pregnancy helped her empathize with that choice a little more. Another woman, in the South, noted that she developed close friendships with fellow-residents who performed abortions-which changed how she saw abortion providers.\n\nVial and Buskmiller have never met, despite their shared affiliation with the University of Texas. Vial is about as far politically from Buskmiller as someone can be. As an undergrad, Vial was the president of her school's Secular Student Alliance, and she wants to pursue a fellowship in complex family planning, where she'd learn how to perform abortions on women well into their pregnancies. But Vial says that she's benefitted from knowing people like Buskmiller-the experience will help her be a better doctor to conservative patients in the South.\n\nAnd even Buskmiller says that she has benefitted from having colleagues with views like Vial's. Despite the years she has spent refining her theological and philosophical position on why abortion is wrong, she has found that theories don't always stand up to the test of experience. She told me the story of a pregnant patient she met while she was working night shifts as a first-year resident. The woman came into OB triage several times, and her situation always seemed precarious. She appeared to be homeless and was suffering from severe mental-health problems; it became clear that the woman didn't have a partner, and Buskmiller noticed signs that she did sex work to support herself. When Buskmiller thought about what this woman's plan should be-for taking care of this baby, for keeping herself healthy, for not getting pregnant again before she was ready-she realized that natural family planning, a Catholic alternative to birth control that typically involves tracking the menstrual cycle, was \"a woefully incomplete answer.\" She was forced to ask herself, Is my world view one that really works for the world that we live in?\n\n\"The conclusion I came to is: Something can be objectively best but totally unworkable in a given society,\" she said. Sometimes, she added, that means \"we have to find difficult solutions and be willing to cut to the quick in our own souls.\"\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Ironic, Unintended Consequence of SCOTUS's Plan to Overturn Roe\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade this summer, transforming a constitutional right into a policy dispute subject to the whims of each state's political process. Republican-controlled legislatures-as many as 22 of them -have already teed up abortion bans that will spring into effect once Roe falls. But what about blue and purple states, where a majority of the country resides? These states are about to become the chief battleground for reproductive freedom. And while the post- Roe future is not even here quite yet, progressives are doing a remarkably good job preparing for the next phase of the fight.\n\nIndeed, one irony of Roe 's demise is that it has prompted many of these states to make abortions easier and cheaper to obtain. The Supreme Court's hard-right turn has had the unintended consequence of making abortions much more accessible in many parts of the country.\n\nStart with the blue states, whose legislatures have, after years of inertia on this issue, finally snapped into action to expand abortion access. These jurisdictions will receive a flood of new patients when Roe goes-and with them, at least two new challenges. First, these states' health care systems will need to accommodate the huge surge of new patients. Second, they will have to contend with red states' efforts to reach beyond their own borders to punish patients and providers in other jurisdictions.\n\nOn the first front, Democratic-controlled legislatures are racing to expand access to reproductive health care-a hugely popular agenda among their base. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have already codified abortion rights , but some are going further to make that promise a reality. In the last few months, Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , and Washington state have passed legislation allowing a broader range of medical providers to prescribe or perform abortions, such as advanced practice registered nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, or physician assistants. They've joined about a dozen states that already permit health care providers other than physicians to help patients terminate a pregnancy. The goal is to create a veritable army of practitioners who can serve the influx of new patients from conservative jurisdictions.\n\n[ Read: Four Ways Blue Cities in Red States Can Protect Abortion Access Post- Roe ]\n\nIn many of these states, the problem is not any legal obstacle, but lack of training: There is a chronic shortage of medical professionals who know how to perform abortions. (Medical schools are not required to teach abortion care, and those in red states may soon be forbidden from doing so.) Blue states are seeking to remedy this problem by funding new training programs to ensure that qualified professionals can actually serve patients in need. New York is doling out $25 million to help clinics expand their capacity by, among other things, training new providers. Oregon has pledged $15 million, while California is planning to hand out $40 million . (The Maryland legislature created a $3.5 million fund to train new providers, but Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has withheld the money .) A new California law also bars private insurers from demanding copays for abortion care, and the state's forthcoming abortion fund will cover out-of-pocket costs for patients on Medicaid.\n\nBlue states' efforts to help out-of-state patients, however, will only be successful if those patients can access care legally. And red-state lawmakers are already considering measures that would punish individuals who travel across state lines to terminate a pregnancy, as well as those who serve them. These laws could authorize civil suits or criminal charges against providers who serve patients from conservative states, as well as those who \"aid or abet\" them. A new crop of \"fetal personhood\" bills would grant legal rights to fetuses, deeming their termination \"homicide\" under state law and subjecting providers to serious legal jeopardy.\n\nProgressive jurisdictions are rising to the challenge. In May, Connecticut passed a sweeping law that allows targets of anti-abortion lawsuits to countersue and collect both damages and attorneys' fees. The measure also bars state officials from investigating health care professionals who are accused of violating other states' abortion restrictions as long as they adhere to Connecticut law. And it prohibits the governor from extraditing an individual to another state for performing or \"abetting\" an abortion that's legal in Connecticut. Washington state has passed similar legislation , and other liberal jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia , will soon follow suit.\n\nIn purple states, the situation is more complicated. They stand little chance of enacting pro-choice bills as long as Republicans control the legislature, so Democrats have had to get creative. The most prominent success story so far is Michigan. Democrats hold the governorship, as well as a majority on the state Supreme Court, yet the GOP dominates the legislature. So there is no real chance the political branches will repeal a 1931 abortion ban that's still on the books-and will become enforceable once more in Roe 's absence.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer has thus taken a creative approach: In April, she asked the state's left-leaning Supreme Court to declare that the Michigan Constitution guarantees a right to abortion. If it agrees, the 1931 ban would remain unenforceable after Roe is overturned. And, in fact, abortion might become more accessible in Michigan, as the state Supreme Court may well strike down a series of existing, draconian restrictions that were not previously challenged under the state constitution. Abortion advocates have also challenged the 1931 law in a separate suit, and last week, a Court of Claims judge barred its enforcement-a decision the Democratic attorney general will not appeal .\n\nThe route to restoring abortion rights in other purple states will be even more circuitous. In Arizona, for instance, the governorship, legislature, and judiciary are in Republican hands after Republicans packed the state Supreme Court to create a conservative majority. So activists have filed a ballot initiative that would amend the state constitution to guarantee a \"fundamental right to reproductive freedom.\" They'll need to collect 356,000 valid signatures by July 7 to get the amendment on the ballot, a grueling, uphill climb. If they prevail, though, abortion will become vastly more accessible in Arizona than it is today, as the amendment would likely invalidate a slew of stringent restrictions that the courts have allowed even under Roe .\n\nThis is the irony of our current moment: The most immediate impact of the Supreme Court's imminent assault on abortion rights has been ... an expansion of abortion rights. Americans in much of the country have greater access to reproductive health care than ever before. Blue states that didn't bother updating their abortion laws for decades are responding to massive Democratic majorities in favor of reproductive freedom. They have snapped into action, countering red-state restrictions at long last. The result will be an ever starker and more combative divide between red and blue America.\n\nRead more of Slate's coverage on abortion rights here.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "This Is a Blood Issue\n\nRoe v. Wade came down in January 1973, which makes it just a few months shy of 50 years old. It is one of the few Supreme Court cases that have made it into the lexicon of ordinary Americans. The pseudonym of that original anonymous plaintiff has become shorthand for the idea that women in the United States have a right to abortion. Now, the name Roe v. Wade will be a marker of a right that was taken away by this current Supreme Court-a marker of the court going in the direction of taking away rights, instead of granting them. In his concurrence with Friday's opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said he also thought the rights to gay intimacy, gay marriage, and birth control should be reconsidered.\n\nOverturning Roe has been the right's explicit plan all along, and its fate had been clear since the country watched the Senate confirm Amy Coney Barrett as the third justice nominated by Donald Trump to the bench fewer than two months before the presidential election. This was after Republicans-led by Mitch McConnell-held a court seat open for nearly a year before a presidential election on the grounds that American voters should get to decide who is on the Supreme Court. There have been plenty of explanations of the shenanigans the party had to pull to seat these justices , plenty of pieces that break down the structural imperfections of our political system . The upshot of all of this is that a set of people put in power by a minority of Americans will get to make the rules for everybody now, and today we are learning what those rules are going to be.\n\nOver the past several months, spurred by the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett and December's arguments that resulted in the Dobbs decision delivered today, I researched and made a season of Slow Burn that looked back at the years before Roe v. Wade . I wanted to understand what the push for abortion rights had been like, what the political environment had been in the lead-up, and what the Supreme Court that had given people this right had been like. And today, as Roe v. Wade is overturned, I wanted to share what I learned.\n\nFirst, the right to abortion is not about the Constitution. Fundamentally, the question of whether women have a right to abortion in this country is a question of power. That is clear in every element of how the decision came to be, and in how it is coming undone. Women's lack of power in our political system is the reason the right to abortion is missing from the Constitution in the first place, and it's the reason the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court (all of them men at the time) ultimately had to consider it.\n\nThe seven Supreme Court justices who voted in favor of the decision that established the right to terminate a pregnancy, at least in the first two trimesters, grounded their reasoning in the 14th Amendment. The decision is most frequently explained as a regard for the privacy between a woman and her doctor, but in looking at the right and the amendment it is based in, I've come to think of it a bit differently. The 14th Amendment came to be as the American government was trying to ensure that former slaves would gain the necessary protections and freedoms as they transitioned to being citizens. It guarantees a right to due process of law in matters of life, liberty, and property-rights that are understood as essential to one's freedom. Among these unenumerated rights are the building blocks of family autonomy: the right to choose whom to marry, the right to stay married, the right to have children, the right for those children not to be taken away from you. And the right not to have children, too.\n\n[ Read: The Supreme Court's Next Target Is Marriage Equality. It Won't Be the Last. ]\n\nIt's not a mistake that the court found this right in that amendment, an amendment with this kind of history, the details of which are hard to stomach . The stories of what women went through as they tried to gain family autonomy-or failed to do so-are harrowing. Not only did women go through the extreme pain and stress and complications that illegal abortion brings with it, but thousands of them died from the procedure in the years before Roe . The exact number of deaths is difficult to pin down , but the circumstances of each were awful. Consider the story of Gerri Santoro, a woman who was left to bleed out in a hotel room after an abortion attempted by her lover went horribly awry. (A photo of her naked, bleeding body was published in Ms. magazine in 1973, to some consternation.) And stories of illegal abortion must also be paired with stories of forced motherhood: I have recommended Ann Fessler's incredibly reported book The Girls Who Went Away to anyone grappling with the question of whether adoption might be a reasonable solution to unwanted pregnancy.\n\nReporting this season has given me a window into understanding that, in many ways, the alliance between the Republican Party and those who oppose abortion has been at the very least partially opportunistic from the very start. But it's also shown me that there are plenty of people who genuinely believe, in good faith and with their entire beings, that life starts at conception and that abortions are murders. I think I gained some actual understanding of why they are not completely unreasonable to think this.\n\nWhat strikes me most about abortion-and the right to it-as Roe falls today is something that many people have raised, but I think historian Jill Lepore put best. She called abortion, along with guns, \"blood issues.\" (Not incidentally, the court released a decision widening access to guns yesterday.) My interpretation of this label, mixed in with the wisdom of others I spoke to for the show, is that the stakes of abortion are some of the highest in our politics. It is about life and death, and it is also about morality. What you think about the issue of abortion informs who you are, and that connection has only gotten stronger in the decades since Roe was decided.\n\n[ Read: There's Already a Revolution in Abortions Happening-and the Supreme Court Can't Touch It ]\n\nThis is why it is so hard to find anything resembling a principled compromise on this topic. The original decision in Roe v. Wade actually tried . Roe considered the issue of aborting a pregnancy within each of the three trimesters. The justices in the majority found that in the first two, the rights of the woman won out over the rights of the fetus. In the third trimester, after the fetus had become viable, they assessed that the rights of the fetus were sufficiently robust that states could limit abortion if they believed that appropriate . Roe was an explicit attempt at a compromise. It's just not really thought of that way. And it certainly hasn't been treated that way by its opponents.\n\nWhere does this leave us? The people I have thought about the most over these past months as I've worked on this project are three women who shared their stories about what life was like for politically active women in the early 1970s: Nancy Stearns, Pat Romney, and Ann Hill. I asked Pat if the work she was telling me about-her work with an organization called the Third World Women's Alliance-was her full-time job, if they were her employer. Certainly not, she said. But \"my first appointment book was when I was working with the Third World Women's Alliance,\" she told me. She remembers that planner so clearly because \"almost every night was booked up with committee meetings and rallies and demonstrations and tasks to do. It was a lot of work.\" This was the same story I heard from Nancy, a lawyer whose work for the movement was so consuming that it essentially became her personal life, too. I think about Ann Hill spending all of her time recruiting plaintiffs for the case she was bringing , and delighting in each additional name, even though it meant she would eventually have to retype the entire list of names on a typewriter. These women understood the stakes, and they acted accordingly.\n\nWhat I have learned above all else is that abortion is a blood issue. It is about who has power and who does not. If you want the right to abortion, you are going to have to fight for it. There is no compromise.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Supreme Court Overrules Roe v. Wade\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, abolishing a constitutional right to abortion that has existed for nearly half a century. Its 6-3 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization -which overrules Roe by a 5-4 vote-paves the way for total or near-total abortion bans in half the states. Justice Samuel Alito's opinion for the court, joined by four other Republican-appointed justices, largely tracks the leaked draft. The bottom line remains the same: the eradication of federal protections for reproductive freedom. The result will be catastrophic for millions of people who will now be forced by the government to give birth against their will. And it will usher in a new era of surveillance, prosecution, and incarceration for those suspected of facilitating unlawful abortions-including their own.\n\nDobbs reads more like a polemic against abortion than a piece of legal analysis. Alito expressed disgust for abortion at every turn and evinced a snide hostility toward both patients and providers. He begins and ends with the assertion that reproductive freedom cannot possibly be guaranteed by the Constitution because it is not spelled out in so many words. Roe , he declared, was an \"abuse of judicial authority\" that \"was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\"\n\nOf course, Roe found that the right to bodily autonomy is a component of personal \"liberty,\" which is expressly protected under the Fifth and 14 th amendments. But Alito rejected this theory on the grounds that the ability to terminate a pregnancy is not \"deeply rooted\" in the nation's \"history and tradition.\" To bolster that conclusion, he presented historical writings (by men) condemning abortion as a monstrous and illegal act. The vast majority of his evidence was written during a time when women had virtually no rights at all, including the right to vote, hold office, practice law, own property, or not be raped by their husbands.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote a concurrence in the judgment, as expected, advocating for the court to uphold Mississippi's 15-week ban-the law at issue in Dobbs -without formally overruling Roe . \"I would take a more measured course,\" the chief justice wrote, recognizing a right to abortion that extends \"far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose\" but no further. The liberal justices wrote a joint dissent highlighting the fact that the decision was made possible solely by the addition of Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the bench. \"A new and bare majority of this Court-acting at practically the first moment possible-overrules Roe and Casey ,\" they wrote, continuing:\n\nIt converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Casey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion bans. ... It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women's freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court's legitimacy.\n\nRepublicans have spent decades preparing for this day, and their work will now come to fruition. Thirteen states have \"trigger bans\" that outlaw almost all abortions; they are designed to take effect once Roe falls, and will be enforced very soon. Four more states have pre- Roe bans on the books that will take effect in the near future. (Another, Michigan, has such a ban, but it has been blocked in state court.) Four other states have six-week bans that are now, for the first time, enforceable. It is worth noting that Texas and Oklahoma already functionally prohibited most abortions by passing vigilante bans that outsourced enforcement to private citizens.\n\nAlthough Alito suggests that his decision will simply revert the nation back to its pre- Roe status quo, that is a fantasy. Red-state prosecutors have already begun investigating and punishing women who miscarry, a tactic that will increase exponentially now that every miscarriage is evidence of a potential crime. Similarly, doctors and pharmacists have started turning away miscarriage patients for fear of lawsuits and prosecution. The treatment for a miscarriage is often identical to the treatment for abortion. It is thus inevitable that women whose pregnancies end on their own will be caught up in the emerging dragnet.\n\nThen there are the countless women who will obtain abortion pills illegally to terminate their own pregnancies. Anti-abortion advocates have long claimed that they wish to punish only the provider, not the patient-but increasingly, Americans manage their own abortions with medication privately, at home. Women have already been arrested and imprisoned for inducing abortions with pills purchased online. The truth is that these medications are extremely easy to obtain and safe to use ; red states cannot realistically prevent their residents from acquiring them. Even when abortion bans purport to exclude patients from penalties, individuals who buy these pills illegally may be subject to a wide array of other criminal penalties.\n\n[ Read: Roe Is Overturned. What Happens Now? ]\n\nRight now, citizens of red states who have enough money and resources can still travel across state lines to access reproductive health care. But Republican legislators are already crafting laws to prohibit women from traveling out of state to terminate a pregnancy. They are considering new measures that would seek to shut down clinics in blue states by subjecting providers and patients to severe civil and criminal penalties. Although Alito believes that the Supreme Court has now washed its hands clean of the abortion issue, the next phase of restrictions will raise a slew of thorny constitutional questions for the justices to suss out.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between states with restrictive abortion laws and states with high rates of maternal and infant mortality. The end of Roe will result in the deaths of many more women, with women of color at disproportionate risk of complications and death from childbirth. It will also increase the rate of child poverty in regions without abortion access. Red states have failed to enact any meaningful policies to address these problems. By criminalizing abortion without bothering to help those forced to carry unwanted pregnancies, they have forced millions of low-income women-and their children-deeper into poverty.\n\nDobbs purports to protect \"life.\" In reality, it will only lead to more suffering and death.\n\nRead more of Slate's coverage on abortion rights here.\n\nUpdate, June 24, 2022: This piece has been updated to clarify how the justices voted in Dobbs , and which number of those votes explicitly were to overturn Roe .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Overturned Roe and Opened Pandora's Box\n\nListen to Amicus:\n\nOn Slate's Amicus podcast this week, Dahlia Lithwick and Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and author of Dollars for Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement and the Fall of the Republican Establishment, discussed what the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson , the case overturning Roe v. Wade , will mean in the short, medium and long term for reproductive and other freedoms. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Walk me through what it means in states that have \"trigger laws,\" states that have laws that need to be ratified by elected officials, and states in which laws go into effect today. Is it true that right now there are clinics closing; patients who were on the table at 10:10 on Friday when the decision came down, not being able to procure an abortion. To the extent that you can project what this means-in the very near term, in the medium term and in the longer term. Can you just walk us through how this dominoes out across the country?\n\nMary Zeigler: Well, we know that in the states with \"trigger laws,\" many of these laws will go into effect very quickly. There are some states that have sort of delay mechanisms. There has to be certification by the attorney general, for example, and then 30 days have to go by. Many states, even Friday have already been banning abortion. I think South Dakota was the latest, but I'm sure there are more that have been happening in the immediate aftermath of the decision. That number will grow.\n\nIn other states there's more complexity. For example, Michigan has abortion on the ballot before voters directly. There's also state constitutional litigation unfolding in Michigan. So there'll be some states that are in a holding pattern in the near term. Then of course this issue will be politically contested in a variety of places. Those include states that once had state constitutional protections for abortion, but now no longer do. Well, I'm jumping the gun a little bit, but in Iowa and likely Florida. There will be states that have complicated politics on abortion where we'll see money pouring in nationally. That'll especially be true of states that have been regional outliers, where people have been traveling to get abortions.\n\nWe may see conflicts. I think President Joe Biden flagged these potential conflicts in remarks in the aftermath of the decision, essentially saying that the right to travel is at stake. So it'll be interesting to see, once trigger laws go into effect, how far are states willing to go to enforce abortion laws? How far are they willing to go in terms of surveillance? How far are they willing to go in terms of regulating the conduct of people out of state? How far are they willing to go in regulating the line between speech and conduct? For example, people posting websites about how to perform an abortion at home or advertising abortion medication.\n\nWe don't know the answers to these questions. I think it's fair to assume that - contrary to what Justice Brett Kavanaugh is telling us - this is Pandora's box, right? So we have no idea where this is going to take us other than to imagine that it's going to be polarizing and it's going to be difficult for people who had not lived through the pre-Roe era to imagine.\n\nOne of the things we can say for certain about the pre- Roe era is that more likely than not the person who was targeted in jurisdictions where abortion was prohibited was the physician. We're in a different world now, right? Where it can be somebody who puts medication abortion pills in the mail. It can be somebody who... The famous hypothetical from the S.B. 8 context is the Uber driver who takes somebody to a clinic, or somebody who drives someone across state lines. So I think one of the things that I see as materially different in Dobbs that maybe we haven't fully wrapped our heads around is that the pregnant people themselves are going to be the targets , as you say, of surveillance and of some of these vigilante schemes that are being put into effect in ways that really don't map onto the reality pre- Roe.\n\nAbsolutely. The availability of medication even puts in play punishment for pregnant people. That's not happening now and I think decent amount should be said about the fact that the mainstream anti-abortion movement does not at this moment want to punish pregnant people. They've actually been fighting state legislators who want to do that, saying no, no, don't do that . The people who do want to punish pregnant people though, have more influence in the anti-abortion movement than they have historically. I chalk much of that up to self-managed abortion because those people are saying essentially, okay, you don't want to punish pregnant people. You don't think you should, granted, but what are you going to do when someone in Oklahoma gets abortion medication from a doctor in Europe and a pharmacist in India? Are you going to just let that go?\n\nI think that's going to be a difficult answer for many people, for Republican lawmakers and people in the anti-abortion movement. So I think it's not only the case that we're seeing surveillance of a kind that was impossible in the pre- Roe era, although it's worth emphasizing that pregnant people were surveilled then too and forced to testify. But we're also, I think, going to see at least more of a push to punish pregnant people themselves. I don't know if that's going to work yet. I think that's a conflict that is very unpredictable, but it's going to happen. The conversations about punishing pregnant people directly are not over.\n\nIt's also worth emphasizing that the folks who are being defined as \"aiders and betters\" by many in the anti-abortion movement is a much larger group of people than we would've seen in the pre- Roe era. The National Right to Life Committee, for example, recently put out a model bill that would define lots of things as criminal aiding and abetting. Abortion doulas, websites encouraging people to use abortion medications. Lots of things that come close to free speech or advocacy being defined as aiding or abetting. So the stakes of this are going to be high for a broader group of people.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The End of Roe Means We Need a New Civil Right to Privacy\n\nFriday's SCOTUS ruling in Dobbs is devastating news. Yes, it denies women and girls reproductive autonomy, but it also augurs a future where no aspect of our intimate life is ours, where even the most private spaces or relationships are ripe for surveillance, where every detail about our bodies, health, and relationships is amassed and sold. Everyone's life opportunities are on the line in a world without intimate privacy.\n\nWith the evisceration of Roe and the triggering of state laws criminalizing abortion, police can access the evidence they need to pursue investigations. Our fertility , dating, and health apps, digital assistants, and cellphones track our every move, doctor visit, health condition, prescription, and search; the details of our intimate lives are sold to advertisers, marketers, and data brokers. Law enforcers can purchase or subpoena data about women's missed periods, health clinic visits, and resumed menstruation. Prosecutors with an eye to higher office will use that data to make cases against women and girls, especially those who come from marginalized backgrounds.\n\nData brokers aren't just handmaidens to law enforcement. Angry exes and pro-life activists can purchase location information to identify anyone who helped facilitate an abortion, including ride-share drivers, parents, and friends who drove women to appointments. State laws, like the one passed in Texas, put a bounty on their heads; thousands of dollars in civil penalties will tempt many to sue. Be on guard for cyber mobs : They will exploit data broker dossiers in order to dox, threaten, and terrorize everyone involved. In the late 1990s, when women enjoyed a constitutional right to pre-viability abortion, websites like the Nuremberg Files doxed \"abortionists\" and called for their murder. With the demise of Roe and the rise of state bounty laws, we may see the emergence of sites devoted to outing a far wider swath of targets. We may see sites crowdsourcing information about women and girls who obtained abortions. This would take a page from the thousands of sites devoted to humiliating women and LGBTQ individuals with nonconsensual pornography, deepfake sex videos, and other violations of intimate privacy. Thanks to a federal law passed in 1996, websites hosting doxing and threats, like those devoted to nonconsensual porn, will be immune from any legal responsibility unless they were found to have a hand in creating the threatening content themselves, as was true for the Nuremberg Files. That's why I have been working with federal lawmakers to reform that law-to ensure that sites earn that immunity by taking reasonable steps to address illegality that causes serious harm.\n\nThere is already a bounty on everyone's intimate privacy. Today, and every day, our intimate data-data about our bodies, health, sex, gender, sexual orientation, close relationships, online searches, reading habits, and private communications-is being collected, mined, and sold . As I have written elsewhere, \"Intimate life is under constant surveillance.\" Crucial aspects of our lives and livelihoods are on the line. Life insurance companies can raise people's premiums if health app data suggests they're at increased risk of chronic disease. Employment services can exclude people for interviews if their online activities suggest that they have bad habits. Some employers have access to employees' period- and fertility-tracking apps, which could enable them to use women's intimate information to raise the cost of employer-provided health insurance, adjust wages, or scale back employment benefits.\n\nRight now, we view the handling of our intimate data as a matter of profits, efficiency, and consumer protection. That must change. Our data is ours . It reflects who we are and want to become, what turns us on, and where our hopes and dreams lie. Intimate data reveals our vulnerabilities-things that leave us open to coercion, manipulation, and discrimination. It should be vigorously protected, not collected in case it might be valuable someday or sold in the here and now. We cannot develop authentic identities, form close relationships, or engage as citizens without intimate privacy. We should be able to wear health bands, talk to digital home assistants, search adult sites, and message dates without worrying about being surveilled. We should be able to enjoy the opportunities that digital tools and services offer without worrying that the details will count against us. We should be able to share experiences, feelings, and thoughts on- and offline, expose our bodies and selves with trusted friends, and learn about our health and identities with the reassurance that the firms facilitating our activities and interactions are also protecting them.\n\nWe need to treat intimate privacy as a civil right. Civil rights are legal and moral rights whose protection is essential for human beings to flourish, enjoy respect, and feel that they belong. Civil rights guarantee our participation in a democratic society. They are moral rights: They cannot be traded away or denied without a good reason. Civil rights are fundamental entitlements owed to everyone , but they also require protection against discrimination given the bigoted stereotypes and attitudes that vulnerable groups face. Civil rights are guaranteed to all, but too often and in too many ways are denied to people who aren't white, women, and LGBTQ individuals (and, most of all, to people with more than one marginalized identity).\n\nTreating intimate privacy as a civil right would require comprehensive privacy legislation. We can find inspiration in modern civil rights laws that require entities with control over important rights to act as the caretakers of those rights. For example, the Americans With Disabilities Act mandates that employers, schools, and public transportation systems provide reasonable accommodations to disabled individuals. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 obligates employers to act as the caretakers of their workplaces so that employees enjoy equal opportunities. Federal and state lawmakers can build on that tradition in protecting intimate privacy.\n\nComprehensive privacy legislation would require entities handling intimate data to act as data guardians. That might mean they could not collect it in the first place. If a business has no legitimate reason to collect intimate data, or if the risk to intimate privacy outweighs the benefits of collection, then that data should not be collected. Under the limited circumstances when businesses could collect it, they would have duties of nondiscrimination and loyalty . Once intimate data is collected, it should be used, shared, and stored in ways that serve people's best interests. Companies would not be permitted to handle intimate data to advantage themselves and to disadvantage us. Crucially, a civil right to intimate privacy would prohibit the sale of intimate data to third parties. Full stop, end of story. Businesses with which we have relationships-the sites we visit, the apps we use, the companies that sell us home devices-are our data guardians. They should not share or sell our intimate data to businesses with which we have no relationship. And they should not be able to ask us for permission to do so. Courts enforcing this legislation should be granted the power to order companies to halt the collection, use, or sharing of intimate data until they comply with the law. If businesses fail to heed these orders, then courts should be able to impose what I have described as a \" data death penalty ,\" an order to permanently stop a business from handling intimate data.\n\nI have been working with lawmakers to make these protections a reality. Recent bills proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Sara Jacobs reflect these commitments. The Health and Location Data Protection Act , introduced by Warren and cosponsored with Sens. Ron Wyden, Sheldon Whitehouse, Patty Murray, and Bernie Sanders, would ban data brokers from selling or transferring location or health data and require the FTC to promulgate rules to implement the law. It would empower the FTC, state attorneys general, and private individuals to sue to enforce provisions of the law and to seek injunctive relief to stop companies from selling intimate data. Jacobs' My Body, My Data Act would minimize the extent to which companies could collect and retain reproductive health data, and prohibit such data from being disclosed or misused.\n\nNo doubt, companies will do everything that they can to defeat these proposals. They don't want any friction between us and their data grabs and profits. I will try to convince these companies that these rules are not the end of the world-that indeed they are the beginning of a new compact for intimate privacy, one based on trust and a commitment to our civil rights. Smart privacy scholars and advocates argue that strong privacy rules benefit companies in the long run by naturally enhancing the trust that we as consumers place in our commercial transactions and relationships. As Ryan Calo astutely puts it, privacy and markets are a \"love story.\" Taking the long view, companies might reap financial benefits of earning people's trust, like having loyal customers. But even if collection restrictions and sale prohibitions just reduce corporate profits with no benefit whatsoever to companies, a civil right to intimate privacy is more important. Companies must adhere to these rules for the good of all of us .\n\nThe Dobbs ruling should shake us from our complacency.

      "text": "Roe Is Overturned. What Happens Now?\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade , which established a woman's right to abortion, with its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . Justice Samuel Alito's opinion in the case largely tracks with a draft that leaked last month and rolls back federal protections for reproductive freedom. What happens now?\n\nIs abortion illegal?\n\nNo, not nationwide. But many states have bans or restrictions that were designed to go into effect as soon as Roe was overturned.\n\nWhat exactly does restricted mean?\n\nAt the most basic level, it often means banning abortions after a certain number of weeks-in some cases, around six weeks, before many people even know they're pregnant. But there are a wide variety of restrictions. Common ones include:\n\n• Overly burdensome regulations for the abortion providers and their faciliites\n\n• State-mandated abortion counseling (often with the intent of dissuading patients from receiving abortions)\n\n• Mandated waiting periods between a counseling appointment and the abortion procedure or provision of abortion medication\n\n[ Read: Doctors in Alabama Already Turn Away Miscarrying Patients. This Will Be America's New Normal. ]\n\nHow do I know what restrictions are applicable to where I live?\n\nYou can see each state's specific regulations here : This is a map, from Planned Parenthood, that shows both existing regulations and the likelihood of future restrictions, including those that could result from trigger laws.\n\nWhat is a trigger law?\n\nThirteen states have trigger laws, which are abortion bans or restrictions that have been passed (or could quickly be passed) to take effect the minute Roe is overturned. Kentucky, Louisiana, and South Dakota have full bans on abortion that will be triggered now that Roe is overturned. (The only exception, in all three states, is if the patient's life is in danger.)\n\nOther states with trigger laws on the books are Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nWhen do those laws go into effect?\n\nIn Idaho, Tennessee, and Texas, the bans will go into effect 30 days after Roe is overturned. (In Texas, existing law already prohibits abortions after about the sixth week of pregnancy.)\n\nIn seven other states, the governor, attorney general, or legislative general counsel would first need to certify that the Dobbs ruling does indeed mean abortion can be banned-a simple formality that could take as little as an hour. These seven states are Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming. (Oklahoma already fully banned abortions in May.)\n\n[ Read: The Most Unexpected Consequence of the Texas Abortion Ban ]\n\nIn states where abortion is or will soon be banned, are there exceptions?\n\nGenerally, the bans have exceptions for cases in which the patient's life is in danger. But high-risk pregnancies are common, and when dealing with complications that don't necessarily amount to black-or-white scenarios, doctors are left grappling with extremely difficult questions . This means we're likely to see cases in which doctors, afraid of being criminally prosecuted, act against their own medical judgment and refuse care to patients until they are near death.\n\nSome abortion bans will include exceptions for rape and incest. But according to the Guttmacher Institute, such exceptions are rare and often require patients to report an assault to law enforcement or navigate other difficult bureaucratic processes. Some may also have exceptions for \"fetal anomalies,\" when a pregnancy complication means a fetus will not survive to a full term or after birth.\n\nSo, doctors could get in legal trouble for helping with an abortion?\n\nYes, even if it's really a miscarriage that a patient needs assistance with.\n\nWill people who get abortions in these states face criminal prosecution?\n\nThere are plenty of indications that a post- Roe world could see pregnant people punished both with fines and jail time. So far, most of the trigger laws impose penalties-often, felonies that can carry substantial prison sentences-on abortion providers, as well as, on occasion, those who \"aid and abet\" the abortion. But in South Carolina, people who have abortions could face a fine and up to two years in prison. And even before the overturning of Roe , in recent years, some women have been imprisoned for ending their own pregnancies in the U.S., charged with the crime of \"feticide.\"\n\nAccording to Politico , some lawmakers are pushing bills that would go further-as in Louisiana, where one bill would classify abortion as homicide . If the legal thinking shifts toward this more extreme interpretation, these laws could lead to prosecutions for women who drink or use drugs during pregnancy (even if they didn't know they were pregnant) or those who have miscarriages or stillbirths.\n\n[ Read: We're Not Going Back to \"Before Roe \" ]\n\nCan you get in trouble for having an abortion out of state?\n\nNo. There's no federal ban, and states have no jurisdiction over other states. It will remain legal to travel to a state without a ban to receive an abortion procedure or medication abortion.\n\nWhat does that mean? What's different about medication abortion?\n\nDecades of studies have found that medication abortions-which consist of taking two pills, over a few days, and are appropriate for pregnancies up to 10 weeks-are very safe and highly effective. As a result, in December, the FDA lifted the requirement for patients to obtain the first of the two pills from just a clinic or doctor's office. (The FDA will continue to regulate the drugs to ensure the ones on the U.S. market are safe.)\n\nThat means that patients in some states with abortion bans will still be able to seek out prescriptions, via telemedicine, from doctors in blue states. (Some providers may require patients to pick up the medication in person or at a mailing address in the state where they practice, and some states with bans are also prohibiting the delivery of abortion pills by mail.) If states pass laws with penalties for the patients who receive abortions, it's possible that patients could face legal repercussions for an at-home abortion, even if they obtained the pills in a legal way.\n\nWhat else should I know about medication abortions?\n\nMore than half of abortion patients now get medication instead of undergoing in-clinic procedures. As mentioned above, the FDA recently ended the in-person requirement for getting the pill. There is a growing marketplace for this mail-order treatment.\n\n[ Read: Everything You Need to Know About Medication Abortion ]\n\nHowever, some states have already curtailed legal access to the two pills prescribed for the abortion medication, and many are eyeing severe restrictions or full bans. These restrictions include requirements that clinicians be physically present when an abortion pill is taken, as well as laws against mail-order pills.\n\nShould we be stocking up on medication?\n\nWhile you can order the pills online or obtain a prescription and pill order from an overseas doctor , to legally obtain them in states without bans, you must first consult with a medical provider, who can then prescribe them for you. (State requirements vary on how you can receive them .)\n\nThat being said, many women in states with bans will be able to obtain abortion pills when needed. In Mexico and some other countries, misoprostol-the second medication in the two-step regimen, which expels the contents of the uterus-is sold over the counter as ulcer medication. Taken alone, it is around 80 percent effective for abortion. It is also safe. (The FDA does not regulate medications sold outside the country).\n\nThe organization Plan C offers a guide to procuring the pills, even when you live in a state with restrictions, and more information on the growing online market .\n\nMany of the online groups are based abroad and are therefore generally out of reach of U.S. regulators. While some activists worry about the potential risks of an unregulated black market, others point out that such medications are far safer than other forms of self-managed abortion.\n\nUh, OK, well then what should I do if I am a person who could get pregnant but does not want an unwanted pregnancy?\n\nThe easiest way to personally prepare for the post- Roe world is to get an IUD or begin taking another form of effective contraception. Plan B-emergency contraception-is still legal.\n\nContraceptives are still legal everywhere?\n\nYep. Birth control, including the morning-after pill, is still legal everywhere. But there are reports that some anti-abortion groups and lawmakers have begun planning to attempt to ban emergency contraception . (Among these groups, the push is directed at both Plan B-type pills and IUDs.)\n\nWill this ruling affect other elements of reproductive care?\n\nYes, banning abortion will lead to major medical risks in particular for miscarriages, given that miscarriages may have to be completed (for the safety of the patient) with a medication that evacuates the uterus. This is necessary to prevent infections. The medication most commonly used to evacuate the uterus after a miscarriage is misoprostol, the second part of a medication abortion. In Texas, we have already seen pharmacists decline to prescribe these drugs out of concern for legal repercussions.\n\n[ Read: Four Ways Blue Cities in Red States Can Protect Abortion Access Post- Roe ]\n\nIf I live in a state where abortion is now banned, how do I find a provider?\n\nYou can locate one in a nearby state here or here . You can find other resources with more information about accessing abortions and getting financial and logistical assistance here and here . If you need legal help, you can find that here .\n\nIf I want to help people who live in one of those states access an abortion, how can I?\n\nExperts say the best way is by donating to local and regional abortion funds , which help with the logistics and finances of receiving an abortion out-of-state.\n\nHow common are abortions?\n\nIn 2020, there were a little over 930,000 abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute . More than 14 percent of women of typical childbearing age had abortions in 2020. In other words, the overturning of Roe will have devastating effects on tens of thousands of people.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Liberal Giant Who Doomed Roe\n\nA year after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health , the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade , most commentary has painted it as the product of conservative excess. As the dissent and others have noted, the court's reliance on originalism is arbitrary. The decision takes no notice of how abortion rights affect women's liberties and equality. The breakdown of church-state separation that the decision represents is staggering, as is its undoing of any plausible division between politics and law. And Justice Alito's use of history, which leads him to rely on pre-Enlightenment accounts of women's worth, is blinkered at best.\n\nReading Dobbs in this way is appealing because it identifies a clear intellectual target and points to a straightforward political strategy, pitting liberal constitutionalism against conservative constitutionalism. But this simple interpretation misses the heart of the matter: The primary intellectual source of Alito's opinion is not originalism but the legal scholar John Hart Ely, a self-professed liberal who taught at Yale, Stanford, and Miami, and who was one of the most cited constitutional law professors of the 20 th century. Unlike Alito, Ely self-identified as neither a hardcore textualist nor an originalist. Upon his death, a glittering roster of mostly liberal legal elites-his colleagues-eulogized him as one of the rare figures who had transformed their legal imagination.\n\nYet it was Ely who argued, in a 1973 essay that Alito would later cite in Dobbs , that Roe was \"not constitutional law at all\" and \"gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\" While the first citation in Dobbs is to Roe itself, the second is to Ely. By the third paragraph of the opinion, Alito is relying almost entirely on Ely's contentions. Of the five factors the Dobbs court deploys in favor of overruling Roe -before even getting to its arguments based on originalism-at least four, and in particular the first two, rest primarily on Ely. Any assessment of Dobbs , and the increasingly conservative tilt of the court more generally, must therefore reckon with the legacy of Ely's critique of Roe , and the opportunities for American constitutionalism it helped foreclose.\n\nEly attained his stature largely because many understood his magnum opus, Democracy and Distrust , as solving a central problem in constitutional law in the late 1970s and early '80s: how to protect minority rights without engaging in judicial overreach. Democracy and Distrust is usually cited for its discussion of how judicial minimalism-the idea that judges should only interpret the law, while legislatures should make it-might be made compatible with the Constitution's use of broad, sometimes imprecise language to protect rights. The book is part of a canon of legal theory that prides itself on being content-neutral.\n\nLess often discussed is an awkward fact: Democracy and Distrust assumes that Roe is the paradigmatic example of a case worth overturning. The essay Alito cites, Ely's 1973 \"The Wages of Crying Wolf,\" laid the foundations for his later book. And though Ely's theory is taught independently from his criticism of Roe , the two cannot be disentangled. To Ely, Roe served as a red line, marking what did and did not count as legitimate constitutional law. This opened the door to subsequent criticism of Roe . A now-famous passage in Dobbs quotes a series of liberal law professors criticizing Roe ; these quotations are in some respects selective or misleading, but they are not merely window dressing. As some have noted , when Dobbs overturned Roe , institutional liberal responses were at first surprisingly muted; many arguments in defense of Roe depended on respect for precedent more than substantive reasoning. Ely's continuing influence is at least part of the answer as to why.\n\nOne might, of course, ask why we should take legal reasoning-let alone its intellectual roots-seriously at all right now, given that the court appears to be comfortable reaching whatever conclusion it wants whenever it wants. But this court is not interested in the outcomes of single cases alone. The conservative majority has greater ambitions: to impose its conception of the Constitution as the only legitimate framework within which to interpret the law. This matters even if one thinks litigation at the Supreme Court is, for the foreseeable future, a lost cause. Constitutional arguments matter not just inside but also outside courts. As the general rise of conservative constitutional ideology has demonstrated, they also matter in the long run as well as the short term. Aiming beyond even the vast powers of his immediate jurisdiction, Alito wants Americans who have different views than his own to think that they have no hope of marshaling the Constitution to their cause. And at this moment, little liberal constitutional theory stands in his way.\n\nNone of this was preordained. Roe is frequently discussed in light of the culture wars of the 1980s and '90s. With these debates in recent memory, it is easy to cast Roe itself as controversial from the start: a flawed case with a troubled legacy. But this mistakes political agitation for unreliable legal footing. At the time it came out, Roe was understood by many-including the predominantly conservative Burger court, which decided Roe 7-2-as a predictable extension of legitimate and deep-rooted visions of constitutional law. For almost a decade after, Roe appeared to be on a trajectory similar to that of Brown v. Board . The decision was debated, but also soundly defended by eminent legal scholars. It seemed on track to become part of the corpus of constitutional thought: a case that lawyers had to reason within, not merely one tolerated as precedent. By the 1990s, however, it had become a sign of intellectual seriousness inside liberal legal circles to say that Roe was a bad case. Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously criticized the reasoning in Roe in a lecture she gave shortly before her own nomination to the court.\n\nThe question, in other words-and this is not just for those concerned with abortion rights, but for anyone concerned with both the court's sudden swerve toward overturning precedent and the future of constitutional law in general-is not, as Alito and many others have tried to make it out to be, how anyone could miss what a terrible case Roe is. Rather, it is how and why so many legal scholars have taken Ely's arguments so seriously for so long.\n\nEly raised a litany of objections to Roe . But fundamentally his argument boiled down to three claims, each of which would, in time, find its way into Dobbs . These formulations, which he first articulated in his 1973 essay and subsequently developed in his 1980 book, may seem abstract, even esoteric-the sort of argument that cannot be parsed without elite legal education. But they are, in fact, relatively straightforward.\n\nFirst, and most famously, Ely argued that Roe was \"substantive due process.\" To Ely, this meant that, by definition, Roe 's right to abortion was fictitious-there was no grounding for it in the Constitution.\n\nEly's critique relied on the idea that when courts use the 14 th Amendment's due process clause to enforce certain constitutional rights, they are confusing substantive and procedural rights. Substantive rights are conventionally understood as the rights one has in civil, political, and private life-rights to or against things-while procedural rights are about what one is entitled to during legal proceedings. The First and Second amendments are usually understood as substantive rights, for example, while the right to a jury trial is procedural. Roe , like several other cases, relies in part on the \"liberty\" protected by the due process clause-a \"procedural\" clause-while abortion rights, like many rights found in the Bill of Rights, are usually understood as \"substantive\" rights. As a result, Roe 's reasoning has often been labeled as substantive due process: It combines both substantive and procedural clauses of the Constitution. In itself, this is hardly a fatal critique: Legal scholars are not in the habit of criticizing the right to travel across state lines, which relies on a similar construction. Ely, however, argued that substantive due process was a tell, that courts are substituting their own \"values\" for \"rights.\" In other words, courts are inventing rights wholesale and, as a result, usurping the role of the legislature.\n\nSecond, Ely objected to the fact that in Roe , the Burger court drew together several provisions of the Constitution. Strikingly, his logic elided the fact that this was not unusual at the time, nor have other decisions that relied on the same doctrinal approach been singled out like Roe . Because the Bill of Rights is understood to have applied only against the federal government when it was drafted, any case protecting rights based on the first nine amendments must invoke the 14 th Amendment if these rights are to apply against state legislatures (a process known as incorporation). For this reason, courts routinely combine the 14 th Amendment's due process clause and substantive rights based on single provisions in the Bill of Rights (for instance: gun rights or speech rights). Ely did not actively contest such cases, while, in sharp contrast, he objected vociferously to the use of the 14 th Amendment in Roe .\n\nWhat made Roe different was its reliance on Griswold v. Connecticut , which had famously found a right to privacy, which included the right not to become pregnant, among the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, as well as being further supported by the Ninth. Specifically, Griswold protected the availability of birth control to married couples, which was extended to unmarried couples a few years later, in Eisenstadt v. Baird . While Roe did not perform an extensive textual analysis of these provisions, by drawing directly on Griswold and other decisions with similar reasoning for its ruling, it effectively relied on this \"inter-provision\" reasoning by reference. This reasoning dovetailed with Roe 's use of the 14 th Amendment-what Ely criticized as substantive due process-because Roe applied to the states, not the federal government. (It was state laws regulating abortion that were at issue.)\n\nIn other words, while Ely tolerated rights based on single provisions of the Bill of Rights in combination with the 14 th Amendment, he disavowed Roe 's reliance on multiple provisions as creating fictitious fundamental rights. Alito's reasoning in Dobbs follows suit: He concedes the possibility of a \"privacy\" right but countenances it only so long as it is attached to either the First or Fourth Amendment. He states, as though in shock, that Roe found abortion rights \"to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisions.\" One might take the fact that Roe relied on multiple constitutional provisions as proof of its overdetermination. But instead, Alito and Ely hold out the presence of inter-provision interpretation as evidence of intellectual weakness.\n\nThird, Ely's dismissal of Roe depends on his contention that abortion rights are not \"political process\" rights. Having made the idea that substantive due process was illegitimate a linchpin of his work, Ely argued that the only way to \"save\" cases that could be designated as such-including a swath of Warren court jurisprudence he was attached to-was to reinterpret them as about political process instead. In what would become his signal contribution to legal theory, Ely argued that courts could articulate these unnamed fundamental process rights so long as they aided minorities that-and here he borrowed from a 1938 opinion by Justice Stone-could be termed \"discrete and insular.\" With this distinction, Ely was able to recategorize as legitimate a host of civil rights cases that might otherwise be termed \"substantive due process\": They fell within his newly constructed \"safe harbor.\"\n\nYet this safe harbor did not extend to women. In Ely's view, because women have the right to vote, because they are numerically not a minority, and because, unlike in cases of segregation, men and women cohabitate, women did not fall within his rubric of people whose political power is compromised. Dobbs takes a leaf from Ely's book in this respect: Alito uses women's right to vote as evidence that the absence of abortion rights would place no unjustifiable burden on women as a political class. Ely avoided the question of gender relations, including their economic and power dynamics. He could thus deny that abortion access could be salient to the political process for women. At the same time, his logic affirmed political rights for fetuses, which he argued were discrete and insular minorities. Ely's analysis therefore pointed in the direction of granting fetuses political personhood, as Dobbs would later gesture toward as well.\n\nWhy did Ely seem so intent on negating the right to abortion? Ely claimed that his work was dictated by the demands of legal theory. In fact, he contended, his willingness to criticize Roe was actually evidence of his intellectual integrity, not cause for question. He regularly stated that, in theory at least, he supported abortion rights, if legislatures wanted to provide them. Yet, clearly, he was also motivated by ambition: In the legal academy of the 1970s, to argue against the grain on what seemed, at least for the time, a settled issue allowed him to position himself as willing to face hard truths for the sake of legal rigor. The moral complexity of abortion and the relative marginality of women in the legal academy helped to ensure that he risked little reputational damage in doing so. While many of his colleagues thought he was wrong on the law, they debated him in the spirit of amicable collegiality.\n\nNone of this, however, explains how Ely's ideas came to determine the scope of constitutional law. Ely's-and Alito's-views were hardly destined for dominance. By 1973, when Roe was decided, courts had spent the previous 30-plus years articulating constructions of the Constitution that demanded more robust individual rights. These ranged from new criminal procedure requirements and the suspension of the death penalty to First Amendment, equal protection, contraceptive, and voting rights. Notably, this also included the articulation of a constitutional right to privacy. This sea change is often attributed to the Warren court's tenure, which began in 1953 and ended in 1969. But it had deeper roots: Among other things, the early 20 th century legal giants Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, and Hugo Black all argued repeatedly that robust individual rights held against state as well as federal power are integral to both the structure and continued existence of constitutional law.\n\nThis expansion of rights prompted criticisms-parts of which Ely later marshaled in his arguments against Roe . Some of these criticisms were in good faith; others, less so. What united those that rose to prominence-something a young Ely no doubt observed-was how they anchored their authority in the aspiration to neutrality. In 1954, in Brown v. Board , the court had invalidated legislation in order to demand that states desegregate. While supportive of Brown , the legal scholar Alexander Bickel warned-via what he famously termed \"the countermajoritarian difficulty\"-that courts should be especially careful when invalidating legislation, lest legislatures flout their rulings and show courts to be powerless. Because we take legislation as representative of the will of the majority, courts are required to show legislation a degree of deference. They must justify themselves when they invalidate law in the name of constitutional rights. Ely would later claim that he was solving the countermajoritarian difficulty in Democracy and Distrust , by providing a nonpolitical way to decide which rights deserved \"fundamental\" protections sufficient to override legislation in this way.\n\nThe leading constitutional law professor Herbert Wechsler, meanwhile, insisted that Brown -and thus court-ordered desegregation-was illegitimate because it violated the First Amendment's free-association clause. What courts needed to do instead, Wechsler famously claimed, was to deploy \"neutral principles\" of interpretation. Ely's \"political process rights\" would similarly be informed by the search for \"content-neutral\" legal reasoning.\n\nYet by the early 1970s, criticism of the new jurisprudence had failed to gain serious traction-not only with respect to racial equality, but also when it came to privacy rights. Leading up to Roe , the famous textualist Justice Hugo Black critiqued the justification for privacy rights used in Griswold . Lodging 1 of 2 dissents in that case, Black essentially argued that, because the word \"privacy\" is not in the Constitution, judges could not infer its existence as a right. But Black died in 1971, and his dissent in Griswold remained marginal. It did not stand in the way of the court's decision two years later in Roe . (In any case, it's worth noting that Black's underlying logic in his Griswold dissent is not in line with Dobbs . Black was a textualist but also a fierce advocate of individual rights. And though conservatives today frequently try to claim him as their own, Black dissented in Griswold at least in part to avoid resurrecting \"ordered liberty,\" the doctrinal test that the Dobbs court relies on.) Wechsler's \"neutrality critique\" of desegregation, in the meantime, had been put to rest by Charles Black's 1971 foreword about Brown in the Harvard Law Review, which pointed out that legal fiction-that \"separate\" could ever mean \"equal\"-could not trump legal reality.\n\nIn the end, it was none other than Robert Bork, the conservative legal scholar who would go on to be rejected, famously, as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who laid the groundwork for Ely's early writing on Roe . Bork had also taken note of Wechsler's work: His 1971 article \"Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems,\" written in a fit of animus against what he saw as the excesses of sexual liberation, repurposed Black's textualism and rehabilitated Wechsler's neutrality. Fatefully, he used both as a weapon against privacy and substantive due process instead of desegregation.\n\nBork condemned Griswold - Roe 's precursor-as the height of judicial overreach, crafting two important arguments that Ely would later reproduce. First, Bork argued that if one allows for Griswold , one has to allow for Lochner v. New York , the universally maligned 1905 case that struck down maximum-hours protections for low-wage bakers. Lochner was a substantive due process case. It was based on what the court called \"the right to contract,\" and the Lochner court contended that this right existed in the 14 th Amendment. Because neither the words \"right to contract\" nor \"privacy\" are in the Constitution, and because Griswold was superficially similar to Lochner , inasmuch as both relied on the 14 th Amendment, Bork argued that Lochner was analogous to Griswold . Both, he argued, simply invented rights.\n\nSecond, Bork drove a wedge between \"substantive due process\" and \"equal protection\" cases. A significant number of the new cases, including many that functionally furthered desegregation, had been decided on bases other than the equal protection clause alone. Several used inter-provision reasoning similar to that in Griswold -for instance, by combining the due process and equal protection clauses. Still others understood the scope of the equal protection clause and the First Amendment to include voting rights and privacy rights, respectively. Bork denigrated virtually all of these cases as substantive due process. Meanwhile, he conceded that formal desegregation based on the equal protection clause- Brown , in effect, if not its reasoning- was legitimate. In doing so, he offered liberals a concession they had already won. Prefiguring both Ely and Alito, Bork used substantive due process as a label for doctrine that required both inter-provision interpretation and the 14 th Amendment (what Griswold and most privacy cases draw on). Bork thus managed to conflate complexity (more steps) with weakness (\"not constitutional law\"). Not coincidentally, the argument managed to draw a dividing line between race and gender, and sidelined class too.\n\nBork's formulations would prove invaluable to Ely, a 35-year-old Yale Law School professor and Bork's junior colleague: more likely than not, they are what allowed him to draft his essay \"The Wages of Crying Wolf\" almost immediately after Roe came out. Swapping Roe for Griswold , Ely relied on the linkages Bork drew between Lochner , substantive due process, and privacy for the core of his criticism. Further, Ely's idea of political process rights-though still in its infancy in this essay-mirrored the structure of Bork's equal protection exception. This allowed Ely to argue he wasn't against newly recognized rights; he was simply rigorously testing their basis.\n\nEly's essay was more eye-catching than Bork's, partly because his liberal bona fides (which he made it a point to announce) made it counterintuitive. Coming at a time when criticism of Roe hardly seemed likely to make any direct impact, \"The Wages of Crying Wolf\" owed much of its salience to its author's willingness to buck liberal celebrations of Roe .\n\nThe legal reasoning in the essay, however, is cavalier, and its style is distinctive. Ely's opening gambit asserts that, rather than law, Roe creates \"values-or whatever.\" Ely expressly and repeatedly analogizes sodomy (which remained illegal) to abortion. A key passage compares prohibitions against both sodomy and abortion as \"cramp[ing] the life style\" of the \"homosexual\" and the \"mother\" alike. On what would become his signature contribution to the field of legal theory-the revival of Stone's concept of the \"discrete and insular minority\"-he writes: \"I'm not sure I'd know a discrete and insular minority if I saw one, but confronted with a multiple choice question requiring me to designate (a) women or (b) fetuses as one, I'd expect no credit for the former answer.\" In such passages, it is hard to tell what Ely takes less seriously-the people affected by the laws he is discussing (in this case, women) or the demands of legal analysis. His cadence might best be described as that of a law professor attempting to imitate J.D. Salinger. Substituting condescension for argument, Ely's essay reads like a stunt, not a serious undertaking.\n\nThis stylistic approach garnered Ely attention, even fans. But serious logical flaws hobbled the essay's appeal. From the outset, Ely's equation of Roe and Lochner was far less stable than he made it appear. Because Roe relied on Griswold 's inter-provision interpretation, and Lochner was based only on the 14 th Amendment, Roe was not clearly analogous to Lochner . The problems with the analogy were evident from the lengths Ely went to to elide them. Soon after his essay was published, Ely began to use \"Lochnerize\" (to impose made-up substantive due process law) as a verb. Just as Bork had done with Griswold , Ely's attempt to equate Roe with Lochner was an effort to make Roe unacceptable by association. As a rhetorical gesture, this worked: We use \"Lochnerize\" today to refer to making up things in the law.\n\nRegarding the legal matter, Ely was far less successful-at first. His peers pointed out problems with Ely's arguments for the remainder of the decade. First, it was possible to persuasively defend Roe 's logic, as Laurence Tribe did in the Harvard Law Review foreword in 1973. Second, as Stanford Law professor Thomas Grey noted a few years later, the distinction between \"substance\" and \"process\" that critics of substantive due process depend on breaks down on close inspection. Finally, as Grey also pointed out, it's not even clear that the reason Lochner was a bad case was because it was substantive due process. Lochner 's misuse of the word \"liberty,\" in other words, is more like Citizens United 's contortions around the term \"person\" than it is like Roe . Throughout the 1970s, these and other weaknesses meant Ely's essay was mostly refuted or ignored. (In recent years, scholars including Reva Siegel , Pamela Karlan , and Samuel Moyn have called renewed attention to flaws in Ely's thinking.)\n\nHad Ely not reformulated his essay more than half a decade later, it might have ended there. In 1980, however, Ely tempered his language and refined his argument. Democracy and Distrust is dedicated to the much-lauded liberal Chief Justice Earl Warren. No longer framed as a critique of Roe , Ely presented his arguments as the solution to Bickel's countermajoritarian difficulty, the problem of how judges should decide cases that pit the constitutional rights of individuals against presumptively majoritarian legislation. Further, Ely argued that he had squared the circle between textualists' desire for clear constitutional rights (largely a conservative demand) and the way that broad, textually enshrined constitutional provisions, such as the Ninth Amendment, supported (mostly liberal) demands for interpretation. Still leveraging his liberal credentials to frame his legal analysis, this time Ely positioned himself not as an entertainingly provocative young scholar but as the reasonable defender of progressive rights, reliable precisely because he put principle over party. In part because it was framed as such, Ely's work became a liberal lodestar. Not coincidentally, the way in which the legal academy interpreted Roe shifted as well.\n\nThe important thing to realize about Roe is that, as a legal matter, none of the problems frequently posited-its moral difficulties, countermajoritarianism, the contention that it is like Lochner -are impossible to solve. Even the oft-cited difficulties around the viability test-the dividing line between a woman's right and a state's interest that marks when prohibiting abortion becomes constitutional-usually boil down to a repackaged argument that privacy rights don't exist. Such complaints suggest that Roe doesn't have a constitutional theory. But Roe did have a positive theory. It built on Griswold and a host of other cases. In doing so, Roe protected the indivisible connection between privacy and women's liberty. Further, most of these decisions were engaged in a similar endeavor: explicating how rights relate to one another, and why the structure of constitutional law requires some unenumerated rights in order to function. Roe 's underlying commitment to inter-provision interpretation, moreover, protected and built on a framework that justified more than just reproductive rights. It also undergirded cases with far-reaching redistributive implications, in particular those in which the court invalidated state laws for effectively discriminating on the basis of wealth.\n\nBy the 1980s, however, the Reagan Justice Department was ascendant, and the intellectual tide was turning against such interpretations. In the face of political headwinds, Ely offered liberals an argument with which they could theoretically safeguard at least part of the case law they were attached to-primarily racial equal protection rights and some election law-without being accused of being \"unreasonable\" or \"activist.\" Essentially, his bargain was this: Keep a limited set of precedents in a safe harbor called \"discrete and insular political process rights,\" but, by dispensing with Roe , give up the fundamental logic that had actually animated many of those rights in the first instance. Because Ely offered a general framework for constitutional law-one that appeared to \"save\" cases liberals were attached to while also \"demonstrating\" that he took seriously the concerns of conservative legal theorists-his work became an essential part of the architecture of liberal constitutional thought.\n\nWhy didn't more legal scholars insist on revealing these problems with Ely, or on advancing the interpretive possibilities Roe presented? Prefiguring challenges we face today, center-to-left legal opinion fragmented. Leading lights of the critical legal studies movement, like Duncan Kennedy, doubled down on the point critics of Roe were making. Starting from what \"conservative critics of the Warren Court have taught us,\" Kennedy \"rejected the attempt to distinguish\" Lochner and Roe . In doing so, Kennedy played into the hands of conservatives.\n\nMany feminist legal scholars defended Roe , but others argued that women's rights were better bolstered through logic that excluded it. Some, like Catharine MacKinnon, viewed privacy as neo-coverture: a patriarchal space that only reinstated gender inequality. Others thought equal protection doctrine seemed the more pragmatic (if limited) route to gains in women's rights. Still others hoped that equal protection litigation could deliver bold and lasting change.\n\nMainstream liberals, meanwhile, were by and large happy to let abortion rights become a \"women's question\" rather than a central issue in constitutional interpretation. In a Harvard lecture in 1980, for example, the liberal lion and D.C. Circuit Judge James Skelly Wright defended both racial equality and economic rights under what he called a \"creative implementation of the equal protection clause.\"* Yet while Wright respected \"core privacy rights\" as precedent, he advised against pursuing any grounds other than equal protection for constitutional rights going forward. To do otherwise, he said, recalling Ely almost verbatim, would risk \"judges imposing their own views on the citizenry on the pretext of enforcing the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nBy the mid-1980s, adopting the language of \"neutrality\" had come to mean abandoning Roe . The ascendancy of Ely's argument reached its dénouement in the early 1990s. Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who by no means wished for Roe to be overturned, found the opinion too broad, and criticized the fact that it was based on privacy rather than on equal protection grounds. During her nomination to the court, Ginsburg's friends had to call to the White House to explain that she was most certainly not an opponent of the decision. In the eyes of supporters of women's equality and abortion rights, her nomination signaled progress. But it also masked how thin-even self-defeating-the fundamental logic of liberal jurisprudence had become. At the same time as she was confirmed to the court, Ginsburg's adherence to the idea that Roe was a bad case was also arguably a prerequisite of being taken seriously inside the academy-certainly in the legal academy in which Ginsburg had been educated.\n\nThe problem with relying on equal protection, as Ginsburg proposed, is that at the time Roe was decided, doing so would have undercut the case. Despite subsequent advances in equal protection doctrine, the protection it afforded women remains far less than that available as a \"fundamental\" right-the right to privacy. Meanwhile, relying on equal protection, or hoping for the eventual promotion of women's equal protection rights' to \"fundamental\" status via the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment or an equivalent doctrinal change, undercut liberals' ability to defend Roe . It would require political conditions decades in the future to make Dobbs possible. But by this point, the interpretive die had already been cast. Although the 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey offered a measured reaffirmation of Roe , its logic was primarily anchored in Roe 's status as precedent. Not even Casey 's restatement of Roe could undo the harm Ely had done to its legitimacy.\n\nCiting the moral complexity of abortion rights, some would rather avoid the matter-never mind that someone else will interpret the law instead. Many others have called for a political-not interpretive-response to the end of Roe , since they see constitutional interpretation as the same thing as federal courts, and those, for obvious reasons, as a dead end. Such an approach focuses on state law, Congress, and executive action. To some extent, this has borne fruit. Without a response rooted in constitutional interpretation, however, Alito's opinion, and others like it, will ultimately reign supreme. The past year has shown how new restrictions on abortion severely affect the lives of countless Americans; but beyond this, Dobbs also has implications for a much broader swath of law.\n\nIf there is a future for constitutional law that exists outside what this court has constructed, it cannot exist in half measures. The constitutional proceduralism of the 1980s has left liberals and progressives with little constitutional capacity to defend Americans' rights. It has also meant that, as Democrats head into the 2024 election season, they have not agreed on a constitutional-rather than moral-argument for why abortion and related rights are more than merely majoritarian preferences. Liberals will need to build a coherent set of constitutional arguments with which to combat the jurisprudence set forth by this court. Doing so, however, will require them to break with the paradigm that Ely created.\n\nFollowing Ely, through a combination of political expediency, professional opportunity, and personal prejudice, the legal academy abandoned Roe . If liberals want to build a constitutional politics that gets around Dobbs , and indeed, one capable of saving existing constitutional rights, they will have to abandon Ely instead.\n\nCorrection, June 26, 2023: This article originally misstated that Judge James Skelly Wright served on the 2 nd Circuit.

      "text": "The Most Interesting Part of the New York Times' Scoop on the Fall of Roe\n\nOn Friday morning, the New York Times dropped an exceptionally well-reported piece by Jodi Kantor and Adam Liptak sketching out the flaccid arc of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the case that overturned Roe v. Wade . Dobbs ought not to have been brought to the Supreme Court, argued there, or decided as it was decided in the spring of 2022, so it is fascinating and infuriating to get an inside look at exactly how it happened. It's a credit to Kantor and Liptak that they were able to find sources willing to confirm that every step of the Dobbs appeal was a pro forma, overdetermined, and ends-driven slam dunk for a conservative legal movement that had no regard for precedent, doctrine, or the appearance of legitimacy and a decadeslong commitment to ending Roe .\n\nBut the true shock of their piece lies in fact that none of it is shocking: Samuel Alito came to the court wishing to overturn Roe and lied about that fact at his confirmation hearings; Neil Gorsuch didn't even bother to read the draft opinion authored by Alito before he agreed to put his name to it, or else secretly viewed a draft before it was circulated to other justices; Amy Coney Barrett has someone in her chambers who wants us to see her as a tormented and complicated woman, even as she refused to do anything but rubber-stamp an opinion that would confirm to the world that she was a token, partisan, politics-haired appointment. And Brett Kavanaugh? He is precisely as absurdly self-important, scheming, untrustworthy, and ineffectual as we all knew him to be.\n\nOne could add a note here about Clarence Thomas' former clerk, who devised the whole case as a bait-and-switch to kill Roe at the same time he was palling around with Clarence and Ginni Thomas at a West Virginia resort. But really, why? The point is not that any part of this meticulously reported piece will surprise anyone who has watched the high court stagger deeper and deeper into disgrace and moral irrelevance. The point is that every single thing described by the New York Times is now deemed ordinary, lawful, acceptable, and accepted at the highest court of the land.\n\nThe gist of the report confirms what we all suspected: There was never any real doubt about the outcome of Dobbs . During their confirmation hearings, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett presented themselves as open-minded on abortion, and generally respectful of precedent protecting women's reproductive autonomy. Once on the court, all three were eager to light that precedent on fire. The only question was one of pacing and optics: Just how quickly, the conservatives wondered, could they overturn Roe v. Wade without delegitimizing the court and cementing their own status as partisan hacks? We learn now that Kavanaugh successfully lobbied the conservatives to conceal their decision to take up Dobbs from the public , waiting until May of 2021 to announce a vote that took place in the preceeding January. The purpose of this delay was to put distance between the announcement and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. Kavanaugh did not want the public to think RBG's passing was the sole reason why the court would now overturn Roe . But it absolutely was.\n\nWe learn, too, that Alito shared his draft of Dobbs with several fellow conservative justices without the knowledge of the others, locking in their votes behind closed doors. We learn that Kavanaugh pretended to waffle on his commitment to reversing Roe , when all signs indicate that he was gunning for abortion from day one. It is clear that Scott Stewart, the former Thomas clerk who defended Mississippi's abortion ban, transformed the case from an incremental attack on Roe to a full-on assault, after attending a reunion with Thomas. We learn that every major aspect of Dobbs was preordained once Barrett replaced Ginsburg: Five Republican-appointed justices wanted to abolish the constitutional right to abortion; they disagreed exclusively over how it would look and how best to deceive and mollify the American public; they fretted about how fast they could rewrite the law without revealing the fundamentally partisan nature of their ruling.\n\nIt's no accident that this week, too, that yet more blockbuster reporting from ProPublica revealed that the body built to police Supreme Court conduct, the Judicial Conference , has been the government equivalent of one of those inflatable air dancers that flops around outside a carwash. Faced with decades of evidence of ethics breaches by Thomas, the Judicial Conference has waved its inflatable arms around, flopped and flapped, accomplished nothing, and then covered it up. When billionaires and oligarchs seek to buy shares in a conservative justice, the only thing standing in their way is the same enterprise pointing you to the $4900 beige Ford Pinto.\n\nSo while there is a lot to say about the Times revelations, let's be perfectly clear about this: Every aspect of Dobbs departed from the court's norms and tradition. Granting certiorari because the composition of the court has changed; allowing a party to radically change its position after cert has been granted; pre-gaming opinion drafts so justices can sign off within minutes; refusing to change material errors in a leaked draft? It's all legal! It's all constitutional! It's how the court rolls! And if any of this surprises or upsets you, be advised there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nWe all read The Brethren. We aren't children. We fully expect logrolling, horse-trading, behind-the-scenes maneuvering, and outcome-driven decision-making from justices, who attempt to hide from us the fact that they are mere politicians, they're just poor. We are told by the Supreme Court's defenders that no such thing as crass political maneuvering could ever happen at the sacred temple on One First Street. We are assured that the robed oracles merely read briefs, take votes, and render judgments in good-faith, largely as a result of the noise-canceling originalist headphones they wear once they are sworn into office. The New York Times piece is stunning and unsurprising: The only thing that is worth tracking is that this maneuvering is now so publicly known ,reported in the Times like the fundamentally political story that it so obviously is. The sources who leaked this information, possibly including a justice, evidently believed it was important for Americans to know what went down here.\n\nWith each new peek behind the curtain, this fantasy becomes more difficult to buy into, even for those desperate to believe. It turns out that the justices-at least five of them on the right-are functionally indistinguishable from cynical partisan lawmakers making deals in the Senate cloakroom. It turns out that abortion rights vanished in America because five conservatives barely tried to hide the fact that they could do that, simply because they could do that. And it turns out that they're increasingly bad at covering their tracks.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nRoe v. Wade is now overruled. Are access to contraception, same-sex marriage, and even the right to choose your own sex partners next?\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nRoe v. Wade is overruled . The Republican Party, which achieved a generational victory when it captured a supermajority of the Supreme Court's seats under former President Donald Trump, has now capitalized on that victory to achieve one of its longtime political goals. The half-century when American constitutional law protected a right to an abortion is now over.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito's majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is substantially similar to a leaked early draft of that opinion , which was published by Politico in early May. Alito's opinion was joined by the Court's four most conservative members. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative who often takes a more incrementalist approach than Alito, wrote a separate opinion arguing that the Court should limit but not yet overrule Roe .\n\nAlito's final opinion doesn't just allow Mississippi to enact the 15-week abortion ban at issue in Dobbs - a ban that violated Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 opinion that weakened Roe while retaining the constitutional right to an abortion up to the point of \"viability.\" Alito's opinion goes further, and concludes that Roe and Casey \"must be overruled.\" It is written in Alito's characteristically snide tone , repeatedly referring to abortion providers by the pejorative term \"abortionists.\" And it rests on a conservative theory that limits which rights are protected by the Constitution.\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,\" Alito writes.\n\nAccording to Alito, if a right isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it must be \"'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' and 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty'\" to qualify for constitutional protection. He then spends many pages of his opinion arguing that the right to an abortion is not rooted in legal history or tradition.\n\nMuch of Alito's account of this history is dubious. The Roe opinion itself argued that, under English \"common law,\" which still forms the basis for much of US law, \" abortion performed before 'quickening' - the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy - was not an indictable offense.\" And there is considerable historical evidence that a right to pre-quickening abortions is, indeed, firmly rooted in US legal history and tradition.\n\nUltimately, however, Alito's opinion is less a triumph of one theory of history over another, than it is the triumph of one political party over another. Roe was overruled because Republicans appointed six justices and Democrats appointed only three. This outcome became inevitable the minute Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in the final weeks of a Republican presidency.\n\nSo what happens now? The immediate impact is that the many state laws that already ban abortion - either outright or very early in a pregnancy - will quickly take effect . Many clinics in the states with the most rigid laws suspended abortion procedures as soon as the Dobbs opinion came down .\n\nThere's also an open question about whether other rights, such as the right to same-sex marriage or the right to contraception , are in danger. Many of the Court's decisions protecting a right to sexual, romantic, or bodily autonomy rely on similar reasoning to Roe . And Alito's reasoning in the Dobbs opinion closely tracks reasoning he once used to argue that same-sex marriage is not rooted in American legal history and tradition. In other words, the logic Alito uses in Dobbs could be used to target other rights.\n\nThat said, Alito's Dobbs opinion does contain language denying that overruling Roe necessarily means the demise of other, still-existing freedoms. Alito declares abortion to be a \"unique act\" because it \"terminates 'life or potential life.'\" That distinguishes the now-defunct constitutional right to abortion from, say, the right to marry a person of the same sex.\n\nThis is one of the largest changes from the leaked opinion in May, which did contain some language suggesting that the Dobbs opinion is limited to abortion, but not nearly as much as the final version. That suggests that at least one of the justices who joined Alito's opinions might have reckoned with the earlier draft's sweeping repercussions and pushed for a slightly less aggressive opinion.\n\nBut whether other rights are next on the chopping block or not, Dobbs is already a sweeping change for America, one that will immediately change society not just in the states likely to ban abortion, but across the country.\n\nEighteen states currently have laws on the books that either ban abortion outright or permit it only in extremely limited circumstances. Some, but not all, of these states permit abortion to save a patient's life or protect them from a dire health consequence. Some, but not all, permit the termination of a pregnancy that results from rape or incest.\n\nMany of these laws are now in effect, after the Court's decision overruling Roe , but some of these states have \"trigger\" provisions that do not take effect until a certain condition is met - such as that 30 days have passed after the Dobbs decision. That means abortion may remain briefly legal in a few states with trigger laws, but that the bans will most likely take effect by the end of the summer.\n\nThe 18 states with near-total bans on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nFour other states - Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina - have laws on the books banning abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy , which is before many people who may want an abortion will be aware that they are pregnant. (There's also the unusual case of North Carolina, which once had an abortion ban on the books. But a more recent law appears to have legalized abortion up to the 20th week of pregnancy.)\n\nIt should be noted that this list of states will fluctuate. State supreme courts retain the power to interpret their own state constitutions, potentially to protect a right to abortion within their state's borders. In Michigan, for example, a judge has temporarily blocked the state's ban from taking effect , and the litigation continues. Given that Democrats currently hold a narrow majority on the state's highest court, the state could protect the right to an abortion.\n\nAnd, of course, Alito's opinion also means that state legislatures can pass new laws regulating or banning abortion. That means states currently controlled by Republicans are likely to enact new bans in the coming weeks or months.\n\nAlito's Dobbs opinion acknowledges that the Constitution protects some rights that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, but only rights that are \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"\n\nHe's made this argument before . Specifically, Alito made this \"history and tradition\" argument in his dissenting opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the landmark opinion holding that people with same-sex partners have the same right to marry that partner as anyone else. \"It is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage\" is not sufficiently rooted in history and tradition, Alito claimed in his Obergefell dissent.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, meanwhile, wrote a concurring opinion in Dobbs where he denounced the concept of \"substantive due process,\" the legal theory that drives many of the Court's decisions involving a right to sexual and romantic autonomy. Alito also rejects the idea that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment implies the right to an abortion. But Thomas goes further.\n\nAccording to Thomas's opinion, which is joined by no other justice, the Court's pro-contraception decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), its decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) that consenting adults have a right to choose whom they have sex with and how they have sex, and its decision in Obergefell should all be reconsidered.\n\nThat said, the final version of Alito's opinion seems to go out of its way to explain that abortion is different from these other rights - again, because abortion involves the termination of a fetal life and these other rights do not. Much of this language was added after Alito wrote the leaked early draft of the Dobbs opinion.\n\nIndeed, Alito accuses the dissenting opinion - which is co-authored by all three of the Court's Democratic appointees - of stoking \"unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights\" because the dissent worries that Dobbs could endanger things like same-sex marriage or contraception.\n\nIn any event, the future of rights other than abortion will likely need to be litigated. There is no doubt that Thomas would happily light many existing rights on fire . And there is little doubt that Alito, based on his Obergefell dissent, would also happily tear down same-sex marriage.\n\nBut it takes five votes to strip away an existing constitutional right, and it remains to be seen whether Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - conservatives who sometimes break with Alito's most aggressive attempts to drive the law to the right - will support mass rollbacks of existing rights.\n\nAlthough there may not be five votes on the current Supreme Court to permit an outright ban on all forms of contraception, the Court may permit states to ban certain forms of contraception that many religious conservatives believe to be akin to abortion.\n\nIn Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), a 5-4 Supreme Court held that employers who object to certain forms of birth control on religious grounds may refuse to cover these contraceptive methods in their employees' health plans. At least some of the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby claimed that \"two forms of emergency contraception commonly called 'morning after' pills and two types of intrauterine devices\" can cause an abortion because they \"may operate after the fertilization of an egg.\"\n\nIt is far from clear that these forms of birth control actually do operate on fertilized eggs. As Dr. Mary Jacobson, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer at Alpha Medical , told me, \"No existing scientific studies validate the fallacy that hormonal contraceptives or the copper intrauterine device act partly as abortifacients.\"\n\nBut the question of whether IUDs or morning-after pills qualify as contraception (which is still protected by existing Supreme Court precedents) or abortion-inducing drugs (which are not protected after Dobbs ) will not be decided by medical doctors. It will be decided by a federal judiciary dominated by conservative Republicans.\n\nIn Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), moreover, the Supreme Court held that state and federal lawmakers have \"wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.\" This line is likely to play a starring role in conservative judicial decisions permitting bans on certain forms of contraception.\n\nUnder Gonzales , to justify a contraception ban, a state does not need to prove that a particular form of contraception definitively acts as an abortion-inducing drug. They just have to convince a court that may be dominated by right-wing Republicans that there is \"uncertainty\" about how a pill or contraceptive device operates.\n\nLitigation over contraception bans, in other words, is inevitable if a state decides to ban common forms of birth control such as the morning-after pill or IUDs.\n\nAbortion opponents will no doubt feel emboldened by their victory in Dobbs , and will try to press their advantage.\n\nOne of the most aggressive anti-abortion theories is known as \" fetal personhood .\" It claims that a fetus is entitled to the same rights as a fully born human being. And thus the law must treat killing a fetus the same as a homicide.\n\nCould this theory gain purchase in this Supreme Court? Based solely on the text of the Dobbs opinion, the answer is \"no.\" Alito claims that his decision \"returns the issue of abortion to ... legislative bodies\" and allows people with varying opinions on abortion to \"affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office.\"\n\nAlito, of course, is notoriously hostile to the right to vote . Among other things, he is the author of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee (2021), an opinion that invented a number of judicially created limits on the Voting Rights Act that appear nowhere in the law's text. So, if Alito's Dobbs opinion does permit voters to shape abortion policy moving forward, it will do so only after Alito has skewed the electorate toward Republicans.\n\nA second caveat worth considering is that the Court recently tripped over itself to ensure that Texas's SB 8 law, an unusual ban on most abortions that relies on private litigation to enforce the ban, could take effect. (Now Dobbs permits Texas to ban abortions outright.)\n\nThe Court's decision in that case, Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson (2021), didn't simply shield SB 8 from judicial review. If taken seriously, Jackson 's reasoning would permit a state to nullify any constitutional right by writing a law with a similar enforcement mechanism as SB 8 .\n\nThe Court, in other words, was willing to do considerable violence to the Constitution as a whole in order to spite abortion rights in Jackson . That suggests that five justices may be willing to take similarly extraordinary steps to restrict abortion in the future.\n\nFor the time being, however, the Court's most recent pronouncement on abortion rights is Dobbs. And Dobbs , at least on its face, is inconsistent with the theory of fetal personhood.\n\nAt least for now, in other words, abortion is likely to remain legal in blue states.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAmericans are confronting a whole new reality of patchwork abortion access after the Dobbs decision.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nFor 49 years after Roe v. Wade , Americans had the right to obtain an abortion if they became pregnant. Then, two years ago, with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Supreme Court put an end to it.\n\nThe Biden administration and some blue states - supported by a network of nonprofits focused on reproductive care - aggressively sought to compensate, while many red states enacted near-total bans on abortion.\n\nBut Dobbs has nevertheless had a devastating effect on pregnant people in huge swaths of the country.\n\nWhile the number of abortions across the country actually increased last year - thanks in large part to increasingly cheap and accessible medication abortion - that has not changed the fundamental realities of post- Dobbs America. Large reproductive care deserts have emerged in which there are no abortion providers for hundreds of miles. Pregnant people are being denied necessary medical care as their doctors fear the legal repercussions of providing it. All of this has exacerbated long-standing inequities.\n\nBoth abortion bans and attacks on reproductive rights are broadly unpopular, and elections in the years since Dobbs showed that abortion rights were a potent motivating issue for voters. But in this year's matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump - both of whom have been reluctant messengers of their party's stance on abortion - there's a question as to whether the issue will continue to motivate American voters.\n\nIt is not too late for their votes to make a difference for reproductive access. It may seem like the worst has already come to pass for the abortion rights movement: though once protected by the constitution nationally, access now increasingly depends on where you live or whether you can afford to travel for the care you need. But Republicans have also made clear that they have no intention of stopping there.\n\nIn the wake of Dobbs , 13 states immediately implemented \"trigger\" bans on abortion, while others sought to enforce abortion restrictions that were on the books before Roe v. Wade was even decided in 1973 or quickly moved to pass new bans on abortion. A new patchwork of abortion laws was established in the US within months. A total of 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion .\n\nMany of these bans involved narrow medical exceptions in which abortions could be performed when the health or life of the mother was at risk. But those exceptions have proved exceptionally difficult - in some states, nigh impossible - to qualify for.\n\nKate Cox, a Texas woman, was notably denied an abortion even though her fetus was diagnosed with a rare and terminal genetic condition and forced to travel out of state to obtain one. Other women have been forced to carry to term fetuses doctors know will die shortly upon birth, or been denied abortion care even after experiencing a miscarriage that leaves them in medical distress. The Texas Supreme Court also ruled against a group of 20 women who claimed that they had been denied medically necessary abortions .\n\nRepublicans aren't stopping now that they have overturned Roe . They have continued to advocate for a national abortion ban , even though Trump has indicated that he would not sign it, and opened up new attacks on contraception and in vitro fertilization .\n\nIf Trump wins the election, he could also order the FDA to rescind its approval of the abortion drug mifepristone after the Supreme Court left open that possibility in a recent ruling upholding access to the drug for now.\n\nIn short: The dust has still yet to settle post- Dobbs , but it's clear that abortion was only Republicans' first target in a larger war on reproductive freedom.\n\nDespite the new restrictions on abortion in many parts of the country, the number of abortions performed nationally has actually gone up slightly since Dobbs . But it would be a mistake to see that statistic and say that everyone has improved access to abortion equally across the US.\n\n\"While the numbers have gone up a bit nationally, in some states, there are virtually no abortions happening,\" at least in a formal health care setting, said Usha Ranji, associate director for women's health policy at KFF, a health policy research and news organization.\n\nThe use of medication abortion, which can end a pregnancy during the first trimester, has gone up in particular . Though it was already the most common method of obtaining an abortion pre- Dobbs , it is now cheaper and easier to obtain quickly, especially via telemedicine. That's because, amid the pandemic, the FDA suspended the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed in person, resulting in an explosion of telemedicine abortion services.\n\nHowever, 19 states have banned telemedicine abortion: Five do so explicitly, and the other 14 require that a prescribing clinician be physically present with the patient. Some states also require counseling or an ultrasound prior to administering an abortion, which can rule out obtaining medication abortion via telemedicine.\n\nThat has caused some patients to turn to community networks or websites that sell abortion pills without interacting with a clinician or pharmacy.\n\nAll of this is a reflection of the monumental effort in states without bans to scale up care, as well as the flood of donations to abortion funds post- Dobbs . New Mexico, for instance, dedicated $10 million to building a new abortion clinic that opened last year on its border with Texas, which has banned abortion with limited exceptions.\n\nBut the question is whether this patchwork solution is sustainable in the long run, especially given that those funds are drying up . And it doesn't entirely mitigate the impact of abortion bans, which have created maternal care deserts across large tracts of the southern US and Midwest.\n\n\"There are still people who are not getting abortions that they would want in part because not everybody can travel,\" Ranji said.\n\nTravel might be difficult for both logistical and financial reasons. And poor women are disproportionately affected: Those women (defined as those who live under 200 percent of the poverty line, which was $46,060 for a family of three in 2022) are concentrated in the 14 states that have banned abortion and the 11 states that have passed strict gestational limits on abortion. Though they may be candidates for medication abortion, they are less likely to know about it as an option - a messaging challenge that abortion activists are struggling to overcome .\n\nThere is also growing evidence that the Dobbs decision has had an adverse effect on maternal health outcomes, including maternal mortality. However, only two years have passed since Dobbs and the number of annual maternal deaths is too small (even if maternal mortality is higher in the US than in any other high-income nation) to determine any trends that have emerged just yet.\n\nSo for now, the best information is based on statistical modeling. Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder projected based on 2020 data on maternal outcomes that, if no abortions were performed nationally, there would be an overall 24 percent increase in maternal deaths after a year. Black mothers would see the biggest increase in mortality.\n\n\"These communities that have historically been harmed will continue to bear the brunt of this abortion care crisis that we're in,\" said Candace Gibson, state policy director at Guttmacher, a nonprofit that researches abortion policy.\n\nAnecdotally, physicians have also reported concerns about their ability to provide adequate reproductive care since the Dobbs decision came down. A KFF national survey of OBGYNs found that significant shares of respondents were concerned about their ability to administer a level of care consistent with the medical profession's standards, their potential legal liability in states where abortion is banned, and health outcomes for their patients. In states where abortion is banned or restricted, for example, six in 10 OBGYNs say their decision-making autonomy has become worse since the Dobbs ruling.\n\n\"They're in this place where they have to really contemplate whether they continue to provide care within that state, or whether they leave the state so that they can actually practice medicine in a way that complies with the standards of care,\" Gibson said.\n\nRepublicans' opposition to abortion rights has proved a thorn in their side electorally ever since Dobbs came down.\n\nIn 2022, Democrats running on abortion rights nearly swept the table . Every ballot initiative aimed at restricting abortion lost , including those in Kansas , Kentucky , and Montana . Meanwhile, ballot initiatives strengthening abortion rights prevailed in states including Michigan , Vermont , and California and even outperformed Democratic candidates in some cases.\n\nIn 2023, Ohio also passed a ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in its state constitution. And Democrats were able to flip the Virginia House of Delegates and maintain control of the state senate after Republican Gov. Glen Youngkin committed to a 15-week abortion ban .\n\nAbortion has proved a key motivating issue in these off-cycle years. The question is whether it can continue to be the same force in a presidential election year.\n\nThat may be the case in a handful of states, especially when it comes to the four upcoming ballot measures aimed at expanding abortion rights. In Florida, a six-week abortion ban that recently went into effect could be overridden by a ballot measure seeking to protect abortion until fetal viability, which is estimated around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nBut at the top of the ticket, the potential impact of abortion is less clear at a moment when other issues, including the economy and immigration, are dominating the national conversation. Critically, low-propensity voters - those who Biden is struggling with and who could decide this election either because they stay home or lean toward Trump - don't rank abortion rights among the top issues they care about, even though they are broadly pro-abortion rights.\n\nBut turnout in this election is projected to be lower than in 2020 due to voter apathy over a rematch between Biden and Trump. Some commentators argue that low turnout might actually help Democrats , in a turnabout for recent American politics. But abortion could help boost turnout in a way that helps Biden, said Tom Bonier, a Democratic political strategist and the senior adviser to TargetSmart, a data and polling firm.\n\nBut first, he has to overcome a clear messaging problem: 17 percent of voters overall and 12 percent of Democrats blame President Biden for the end of Roe , according to New York Times/Siena College polls and a Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena poll in battleground states. Some less-engaged voters inaccurately associate the overturn with Biden because he was president when the conservative-controlled Supreme Court issued the decision.\n\nBut it also shows that Biden - who as a Catholic has been at times an uncomfortable messenger of his party's pro-abortion rights stance - has room to persuade voters.\n\n\"One of the jobs in front of Democratic campaigns, including the president's campaign, is [to] spend time communicating with these voters and make sure that they understand the reality,\" Bonier said. \"I don't think that most voters are aware of what Republicans are doing, unless they're in the states where it's happening. But I do think those issues will have a substantial impact on the election as that is communicated to more voters.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Vox Staff\n\nThe US Supreme Court has officially overturned Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion. Now the matter will be settled on a state-by-state basis, with 22 states likely to quickly ban all or nearly all abortions .\n\nThe road to the decision began when the state of Mississippi enacted a law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The state's law violated the Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) that pregnant people have a right to terminate their pregnancy up until the point when the fetus is \"viable.\" But Justice Samuel Alito's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturns that standard and Roe .\n\nAlito's opinion is similar to a draft opinion obtained and published by Politico in May - a largely unprecedented leak that rattled the Court and the nation. But even before the leak, the conservative supermajority on the Court had repeatedly signaled they were willing to overturn Roe and allow states to ban abortions .\n\nFollow here for all of Vox's coverage on the ruling, the state of abortion rights nationwide, reaction, analysis, and more.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nFor 49 years after Roe v. Wade , Americans had the right to obtain an abortion if they became pregnant. Then, two years ago, with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Supreme Court put an end to it.\n\nThe Biden administration and some blue states - supported by a network of nonprofits focused on reproductive care - aggressively sought to compensate, while many red states enacted near-total bans on abortion.\n\nLi Zhou\n\nIt's been nearly one year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion via the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health decision. In the months since, abortion access has been mostly banned in 14 states , stringent gestational limits have been put in place in several others, and the approval of medication abortion has been challenged in the federal courts.\n\nSuch policies have left both patients and providers scrambling to navigate harsh new restrictions and penalties. For many patients, these policies have meant traveling out of state, incurring serious risks to their own health, and in some cases, carrying unwanted pregnancies to term . For providers, the end of Roe has meant fears of being punished for providing abortions, possible discipline from state medical boards , and, in states where abortion remains legal, an influx of patients from other places.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nThe US Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has raised the stakes of competitive governor's races in 2022, with Democratic and Republican candidates advocating for competing visions of abortion access.\n\nIn some states, Democrats hope to wield veto power over legislation from Republican-controlled state legislatures that want to curb abortion rights. Elsewhere, Republicans want to use governorships to defend existing state laws restricting abortion and are charting a path to further curb access to the procedure.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nEarlier this year, five people altered the landscape of reproductive rights in more than a dozen states across the country when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade . In November, millions of voters will weigh in, casting votes in dozens of races and ballot measures that will determine how restrictive their state can be.\n\nBallot initiatives in three states could determine abortion access for millions of women and what kind of reproductive health care is available to them. Abortion has also become a key issue in races for governor and state attorneys general, who have direct control over their states' abortion laws and how they are enforced.\n\nRani Molla\n\nOn Tuesday, an unprecedented number of Kansans voted against a constitutional amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to end abortion protections. That's a big win for women's rights, but the outcome also carries major implications for elections nationwide this November. It's especially true in those states where abortion rights are on the ballot after the overturning of Roe Vs. Wade and where Democrats are seeking to stay in power.\n\nContrary to what some conservatives had thought , abortion is an issue that can mobilize voters.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nKansans voted decisively against a ballot measure on Tuesday that would have allowed state lawmakers to further restrict abortion access in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which could have severely limited abortion access in the region.\n\nThe measure, known as the \" Value Them Both Amendment ,\" was defeated 59 to 41 percent (as of Wednesday morning). The campaign director of Kansans for Constitutional Freedom , the pro-abortion rights group that worked to sink the amendment, hailed their victory as \"truly an historic day for Kansas and an historic day for America.\" Value Them Both , the group that backed the amendment, promised to ensure their loss is just \"a temporary setback.\"\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nA month after the Supreme Court's decision overruling Roe v. Wade , it's unclear whether many patients with dangerous pregnancies can receive medically necessary abortions. Some women have traveled to other states for lifesaving care because doctors in their home state feared prosecution. Others were left to bleed by their health care providers who feared they couldn't legally provide care that would stop it.\n\nA lawsuit , filed by the Justice Department on Tuesday, could alleviate at least some of these cases - and potentially provide legal clarity to doctors who want to perform medically necessary abortions but fear being hauled off to prison if they do. The case is United States v. Idaho .\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nThe case of a 10-year-old Ohio rape survivor who traveled to Indiana to obtain an abortion drew national attention to Ohio's near-total abortion ban, which does not allow abortions even in cases of rape or incest.\n\nOhio isn't unusual. Despite broad agreement among Americans that victims of rape should be allowed to obtain an abortion, nearly all of the states with abortion bans do not make exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nSara Morrison\n\nRep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) uses a period-tracking app. So do many of her friends and constituents, who messaged her about those apps after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade leaked. Major privacy concerns with period tracking apps emerged earlier this year, as the possibility that abortion could become illegal in certain parts of the country loomed. That's when Jacobs realized many people didn't know what they were supposed to do to keep their online data private.\n\n\"I realized each individual person shouldn't have to figure this out on their own,\" Jacobs told Recode. \"It's our job as a government to protect this very sensitive and personal data.\"\n\nAllie Volpe\n\nIn the weeks since the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , in which the court ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, questions concerning access to contraceptives in the United States have proliferated. How does the ruling impact birth control? Do states have the power to limit access or ban specific types of contraceptives?\n\nAs of mid-July, \"things have not changed as of right now,\" says Mara Gandal-Powers , the director of birth control access at the National Women's Law Center . \"Everyone still has the constitutional right to birth control. Insurance coverage has not changed for birth control.\"\n\nLi Zhou\n\nAs a fiery viral speech she gave earlier this year made clear, Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow isn't one to mince her words - and she doesn't want other Democrats to do so either .\n\nMcMorrow thinks her party can be a lot more explicit when fighting GOP attacks , particularly as they struggle to defend their congressional majorities and retake state legislatures this fall .\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nMethotrexate is a fairly common drug that treats a wide range of medical conditions. I take it to help control an autoimmune disorder. So do about 60 percent of rheumatoid arthritis patients . It is used to treat some cancers , such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It also has at least one other important medical use.\n\nThe drug is the most common pharmaceutical treatment for ectopic pregnancies , a life-threatening medical condition where a fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus - typically a fallopian tube. If allowed to develop, this egg can eventually cause a rupture and massive internal bleeding. Methotrexate prevents embryonic cell growth, eventually terminating an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nEmily St. James\n\nIn the immediate wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade , social media filled with images and memes playing off a viral tweet : A clean-cut couple beams at the camera while standing outside the Supreme Court building and holding a sign reading \"We will adopt your baby.\" (Slate has the full story on the couple featured in that photo.)\n\nIn a post- Roe world, there is already a renewed focus on adoption as a supposed solution for unwanted pregnancies. Indeed, in the arguments before the Supreme Court last year, Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested that adoption is a foolproof substitution for abortion. Yet the rhetoric around adoption too rarely takes into consideration the person having the baby who will be adopted.\n\nMiranda Dixon-Luinenburg\n\nPopular culture tends to focus on a few elements of pregnancy: morning sickness , the growing baby bump , and, of course, mood swings . But that ignores more dangerous, less well-known conditions associated with pregnancy. Up to 10 percent of pregnant US women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes and uncontrolled high blood sugar; untreated, this can result in a difficult delivery, and risks developing into Type 2 diabetes years later. Meanwhile, 2 to 8 percent of women worldwide have symptoms of preeclampsia , a condition involving high blood pressure that can lead to fatal seizures if untreated, can damage the mother's organs, and increases the risk of chronic disease later in life for the baby.\n\nBut even a supposedly normal, healthy pregnancy with no complications can lead to a lot more than just morning nausea. And the ordeal isn't over when the baby is born; pregnancy changes one's body permanently, and labor is often traumatic. If it weren't taken for granted as a natural part of life, pregnancy could easily be considered a chronic illness or disability . Women with pregnancy-related impairments are legally a protected class under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act .\n\nNicole Narea and Li Zhou\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade , Democrats have repeatedly proposed the same solution: voting in the midterms .\n\n\"If you want to change the circumstances for women and ... girls in this country, please go out and vote,\" President Joe Biden emphasized in a speech on Friday . \"For God's sake, there's an election in November.\"\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nIn his decision overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey , Justice Samuel Alito argues that the rulings that had protected abortion rights were not only poorly reasoned but actively harmful to American democracy.\n\n\"Far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division,\" Alito writes in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health . \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\"\n\nEmily Stewart\n\nCompanies stepping up to say that they will support their workers in accessing abortions after the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Roe v. Wade raises questions both logistical and existential. For example, do you really want to ask your boss at Dick's Sporting Goods for $4,000 and a couple of days off to terminate a pregnancy? If you start to think about the situation beyond the press release, it can get pretty disturbing pretty quickly. It reinforces how supremely screwed up the entire post- Roe situation is, as well as the setup of the United States health care system.\n\n\"It's better than nothing, I'm not going to say it's bad,\" said Kate Bahn, director of labor market policy and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"It's a Band-Aid on a stab wound.\"\n\nAnna North\n\nWhen the last abortion clinic in Texas closes its doors for good , Prestonwood Pregnancy Center will remain.\n\nSo will Agape, with locations in Round Rock, Austin, Cedar Park, and Taylor. So will the Pregnancy Help Center, operating in Texas's Brazoria County since 1990.\n\nLi Zhou\n\nThis past weekend, more than 30 Democratic senators had a message for President Joe Biden: They want him to do more to protect abortion rights, and they want him to do it now.\n\n\"There is no time to waste,\" they said in the letter, which was led by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and sent one day after the Supreme Court announced its decision to officially roll back Roe v. Wade . \"You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision.\"\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nEditor's note, June 26: The following is an updated version of an essay that originally ran in Vox in May. We are republishing it with revisions in light of the Supreme Court's decision overruling Roe v. Wade .\n\nIn an 1832 case called Worcester v. Georgia , the Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation constituted a sovereign entity with rights in its territory that cannot be overruled by state governments. President Andrew Jackson, who supported the seizure of Native lands, was infuriated by Chief Justice John Marshall's ruling, reportedly saying that \"Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\"\n\nSara Morrison\n\nThe Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has made abortion illegal in many parts of the United States, with a possible future where it's illegal everywhere. The pervasive and barely regulated data collection industry could have a big role to play in investigating and proving cases against people accused of performing or getting abortions.\n\nA lot of data is readily available if law enforcement wants it because there's very little, legally, restricting its collection. And we know the police use that data all the time, getting it through court order or by simply buying it. Through your phone and your computer, they can find out where you go, who you interact with, what you say, what you search the internet for, which websites you visit, and what apps you download.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nThe US Supreme Court has officially overturned Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion. Now the matter will be settled on a state-by-state basis, with 22 states likely to quickly ban all or nearly all abortions .\n\nEven before the Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Friday, Republican state legislatures across the country had been forging ahead with new bans and restrictions, in anticipation of the decision.\n\nJillian Weinberger\n\nIn 1976, just a few years after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in Roe v. Wade , most Americans thought abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances.\n\nThose numbers haven't changed much over almost 50 years. Most Americans still believe abortion should be legal in most circumstances . But our politics have shifted dramatically. And with the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - which effectively overturned Roe - reality has shifted as well. No longer is abortion protected at the federal level.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nThe Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade is a development of enormous political and social consequence, one that could could almost immediately trigger tectonic changes in health and well-being.\n\nWe know this due to important research published in 2020 that compared the fates of women who were forced to carry pregnancies to term versus those who were provided abortions. The influential Turnaway Study, as it's commonly known, found that, among other things, women who were denied an abortion endured more serious pregnancy complications, more chronic pain, and more short-term anxiety.\n\nAja Romano\n\nOn the weekend of May 7, protesters angered by the leaked draft of a pending Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade assembled in front of Supreme Court justices' houses. A crowd of a few hundred people first gathered at the house of Justice Brett Kavanaugh before moving over to Chief Justice John Roberts, who lives in the same Chevy Chase, Maryland, neighborhood. The crowd then headed back to Kavanaugh's house while police guarded properties.\n\nWhile the protest was peaceful, it caused a firestorm online, where some liberals joined conservatives in condemning the protesters for entering these neighborhoods. On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki released a statement apparently decrying the very idea of protesting the justices. Protesting \"should never include violence, threats, or vandalism,\" Psaki stated on behalf of President Biden. \"Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOvernight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. It has upended some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\n\nby Marin Cogan\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion enshrined by Roe v. Wade last June, there were near-immediate consequences for women, children, and families: A 10-year-old victim of rape was forced to cross state lines to receive an abortion. Women were denied care while having miscarriages due in part to confusion among health providers. Thirteen states enacted trigger laws, which banned nearly all abortions (though some faced legal challenges), while other states moved to severely restrict the procedure. In the following weeks, some women suffered from sepsis before receiving medically necessary abortions.\n\nIt will likely take years to understand the full scope of the consequences, though experts say it will mean more children born in states with high rates of maternal and infant death, and negative physical and mental health outcomes for mothers that will affect their children .\n\nOther reverberations from the Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization will be harder to measure. Overnight, a generation of women born with the constitutionally protected right to an abortion saw it taken away. While earlier restrictions and legal challenges had meant that some women, particularly in the South, were living with a de facto ban before the fall of Roe , formally losing that right has had serious implications for people of reproductive age, plunging many women into uncertainty and forcing them to consider how a rapidly shifting political landscape could affect some of the biggest decisions of their lives.\n\nTo better understand how the fall of Roe - which was decided 50 years ago this week - is upending a generation's family planning and reproductive decision making, Vox spoke with women across the country last fall. Many were wondering how they might prepare for worst-case scenarios they had never considered before. Those questions dogged women who were mothers, and those who weren't, and were particularly fraught for women with medical conditions like endometriosis, which can cause complications during pregnancy. They also affected trans men who could get pregnant and cis men - some of whom decided to get vasectomies to prevent unwanted pregnancies .\n\n\"I find that I'm having more general conversations about pregnancy and pregnancy prevention,\" said Dr. Taniqua Miller, an OB-GYN and professor at the Emory School of Medicine.\n\nRight after the ruling, Miller said, she heard from a few patients who were thinking about sterilization. \"I think the Dobbs decision did make them really consider what the next phase of contraceptive care would be, not just abortion care, but more thinking about contraception,\" Miller said. \"I think that there is the thought: Will there be a slippery slope? Will contraception be available in the future? And I don't think that we can really speak to that.\"\n\nEllen, a 38-year-old who works in communications in Chicago, was pregnant when the Dobbs ruling was announced. (Because of new concerns about privacy, Vox is withholding the last names of women who requested it.) Ellen always knew she wanted children, but the experience of trying to start her family was complicated. Her first pregnancy, in 2020, was ectopic , meaning the pregnancy was nonviable: She needed emergency surgery to remove one of her fallopian tubes.\n\nIn 2021, she and her husband again got pregnant but doctors later found a genetic abnormality, and lost the fetal heartbeat. Ellen was given the option of doing a dilation and curettage, or D&C procedure , to remove the fetal tissue, taking medication to expel it, or waiting until it happened naturally. \"It was unbearable for me to think about just waiting for weeks or possibly a month to reach that natural termination process,\" Ellen said.\n\nEllen got pregnant again after doing in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 2022. After the court overturned Roe , even living in a state with legal abortion, she said, was suddenly little comfort. Three months after Dobbs , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a bill banning abortion at 15 weeks ; Ellen thinks that given the longstanding pressure from anti-abortion activists, it's a very real possibility that if a Republican wins the presidency in 2024, the party could try to pass a national abortion ban. She wouldn't be willing to risk pregnancy if that happened, which means that she wants to try to get pregnant with her second child before a Republican could be sworn in and further restrictions could be passed.\n\n\"I always imagined us having two children,\" Ellen said. \"Knowing that I could have an ectopic pregnancy again and watching what's happening in states like Texas and Oklahoma, where people are going to the hospital with potential ectopic [pregnancies] and not being able to get treatment for that, even though it's a non-viable pregnancy - it scares the hell out of me.\" Like others who've done IVF, Ellen wonders what the vague language in many states' abortion laws mean for the future of her embryos .\n\nEllen's child was born in December. As Ellen considers trying to get pregnant again, she is thinking a lot about the very real implications of these new laws. \"It doesn't escape me, because I had an ectopic as my first pregnancy. A hundred years ago, there was no way to detect those pregnancies, women just died,\" she said. \"And to see those choices taken back from me ... it's really scary because, part of having a family, as I always wanted, was the presumption that I would be alive to enjoy it.\"\n\n\"There are millions of people in the US who are of childbearing age who are making these decisions,\" Ellen said. She felt that policy was being made by politicians without a real sense of what she and other women experienced. \"And it makes me feel like less of a citizen.\"\n\nEllen wasn't alone in feeling like she needed to decide quickly about a second child. Dorothy, 38, who lives in Washington, DC, and works in health care, also worries about a national abortion ban if Republicans took office, and about the possibility that a Republican controlled Congress - which has the ability to approve and reject laws passed in the District - might try to restrict abortion rights there. If a Republican wins the next presidential election, she doesn't want to give birth after they are inaugurated, which means she'd need to be pregnant by early 2024, at latest.\n\n\"I would be scared about fetal abnormalities, I'd be scared about pregnancy complications and miscarriage ... and I'd worry about my treatment options,\" Dorothy says. She has friends and family in Texas, and has seen the ways in which this is already affecting them. In addition to fearing for her own health and well-being, Dorothy thinks a lot about what the lack of options would mean for her family, including her 4-year-old son.\n\n\"I know that this isn't low-risk. It feels very unwise to leave that level of uncertainty about my ability to protect myself. I'm a mom. I can't die in childbirth. I have a child to take care of. That weighs on me,\" she said. For that reason, she believes she's left with two choices: decide to try for another child within the next several months, or resolve to not have any more children. \"The fact that I'm making these decisions in the absence of a right I've always had is infuriating,\" she said.\n\nThe decision has had major ramifications for women who have chosen not to have children, too. Kate Anderson, a student finishing her degree, lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with her husband. In her early 30s, Kate started suffering from fibroids and endometriosis, which causes heavy bleeding and painful, debilitating cramps. Her doctors suggested that Kate consider a hysterectomy, but the process was taking too long. Instead, she had the fibroids removed and an IUD inserted. Since that helped alleviate her symptoms, she didn't feel the need to move forward with the hysterectomy, and she was feeling fine with her choices for years, until last summer.\n\n\"The Dobbs decision kind of changed everything in my calculus, because now it's just too risky,\" Kate said. In the months before the decision came out, some abortion opponents suggested that they'd seek to restrict access to contraception - and Kate started worrying that the IUD she depended on to prevent pregnancy and treat her symptoms would become the next target.\n\nThe day after the ruling, Kate called two surgeons to schedule appointments to discuss having her hysterectomy. She had the procedure done in the beginning of August. \"This is the only way that I feel I could for sure never have to worry about this,\" Kate said. \"The reality is you are having a whole organ system removed, or most of it, and that is major surgery.\"\n\n\"It makes me angry that I feel I had to go through a major surgery to feel safe,\" Kate continued, \"and it makes me even more angry that I have the privilege to have access to good enough insurance and surgeons that it was covered, while many women will not.\"\n\nLike Kate, Alice, a 34-year-old artist living in Augusta, Georgia, always knew she didn't want to have kids. Before the Dobbs decision, she discussed the possibility of a tubal ligation , a sterilization procedure, with her doctor, but was relying on an IUD for birth control. She was working from home when a friend texted her that the Court had overturned Roe .\n\n\"I called my OB-GYN's office that day, and I was like, put me on the schedule, as soon as you can. I'm done. I don't want to take the risk,\" Alice said. About a month after the Court's decision, Georgia's ban on abortion after five or six weeks went into effect - before many women know they're pregnant. Alice got her tubal ligation in late August, and she said she has no regrets.\n\n\"I really do feel like I didn't have any other choice. I had to choose to eliminate the possibility, rather than living with the idea that if I was assaulted or a victim of something horrible, that if a pregnancy resulted from that, that I would not have the option to choose what I wanted to do with my body. It's not fair.\"\n\nThe pressures felt acute for women who were further along in their personal and professional lives, but they were also felt deeply by younger women. Kyle Siemers, a 24-year-old medical student from South Dakota who's interested in becoming an OB-GYN, said she called her doctor the day of the Dobbs decision to inquire about having her IUD replaced - part of a surge of women looking into birth control options post- Dobbs . South Dakota had a trigger law that outlawed all abortions except in the case of life endangerment once the Dobbs decision came out. Kyle had her IUD replaced a month later, switching to one that prevents pregnancy for up to eight years .\n\n\"I definitely want to have a family at some point in time. The main driver for me right now is that I'm in graduate school and financially, and I think time-wise as well, I could not support starting a family right now,\" Kyle said.\n\nRachel was finishing law school last year and considering where to start her career when the decision came out. She was moved to tears. Rachel, like Kate, has endometriosis, which can cause complications and high-risk pregnancies, and the notion that she might not have access to abortion if she needed one made her think differently about where she wanted to work.\n\n\"Now, states' abortion laws are the most important factor in deciding where I'll put down roots,\" Rachel said. She was offered a job in Virginia, and her family wanted her to consider jobs in Pennsylvania, where she's from. But even in Pennsylvania, a state where abortion is still legal through 23 weeks , Rachel didn't feel safe: At the time she was considering her options, the Republican nominee for governor, Doug Mastriano, made national headlines for being one of the most hardline abortion opponents in the country .\n\n\"It just doesn't feel like the place I can start my career, a family, or anything like that,\" Rachel said. She chose a job in New York state instead. But before she did, Rachel voted early in the Pennsylvania election. It felt important to her, she said, to exercise her vote as a protest.\n\nExit polls and interviews with voters after the 2022 midterm elections made clear that abortion was a major factor in voters' decisions, and caused Republicans to underperform in key races, leading some analysts to argue that the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe cost Republicans a major midterm victory . Kelly Clancy, a 42-year-old academic editor and mother of three, noted that voting wasn't the only way people acted on their convictions.\n\n\"One of the ways [people] practice their politics is thinking about the way they want their kids to be raised,\" she said. Until recently, Kelly and her family lived in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she was a professor. Once the pandemic began, she and her husband realized that they needed to be closer to family. They considered moving either to Austin, Texas, where her family lives, or New York, where his family lived. As they were deciding, Texas passed SB 8, a bill banning abortion after six weeks , and a precursor to the laws that would go into effect in other states several months later.\n\nKelly and her husband thought a lot about what would be best for their kids, who are still young but would be growing up under Texas's new legal regime. They were concerned about the ban on abortion, and also the way Texas was investigating the parents of trans children and banning books from schools. \"The conversation that we had wasn't just about abortion, but about all of the other things that treating girls and women as second-class citizens impacts. Will they have access to birth control? What happens if one of their friends needs an abortion?\" Kelly said. \"I would like my daughters to live in a country where their gender matters as much or as little as they want it to. I certainly want them to live in a state where their rights are protected.\"\n\nKelly thought about her son, too. If her family moved to Texas, she said, \"My son would still be growing up in an environment where those were the prevalent conversations around women and their bodies.\"\n\nHer family ultimately decided to move to New York instead of Texas. It wasn't an easy choice to make. On some level, Kelly felt like she was caught between wanting to fight for the future of a state that she feels a deep connection to, and protecting her kids. And like nearly every woman Vox spoke to for this story, Kelly felt it was a privilege to be able to make any sort of decision about her and her family's future, knowing that so many women will, because of these restrictions, find themselves with even fewer options.\n\nWhile many women were considering what the decision would mean for their families, some also weighed how it might affect those who can't have kids on their own. Emily Morey, a nurse from Maine, is a mother of two who delivered two more babies as a surrogate, most recently in January 2022. Emily loved being able to help other parents start their families. She felt it was a gift she was able to give other people, one she felt deeply gratified to provide. In Maine, abortions remained legal up to the point of viability , but the state had an anti-abortion Republican as its governor until early 2019, and Emily felt strongly that her rights were now vulnerable to political interference. She decided she was done with surrogacy.\n\nThe decision was hard to make. \"It was a really big part of my life, something that I wanted since I was very young. To be a mom, to be pregnant, to have babies, and to have babies for other people: it's been so much of my life for such a long time. And to know, in that moment when I heard that the decision had come down, that it's too risky, I cannot for any reason put myself in that position - it's so sad and so hard to know that I didn't get to pick when I was done.\"\n\nEmily thought of the other parents, who often spent years on waiting lists trying to find a surrogate. \"It's an immeasurable loss,\" she said. \"To know that those lines are getting longer, that those parents will have to wait longer and they may not be able to have children of their own because there isn't a surrogate to help them, breaks my heart.\"\n\nEmily was now considering something else: tubal ligation. \"It's definitely not something I had made a plan for. It's not something I had had a conversation with my doctor about. But now, it's something I think about all the time. I have an upcoming visit with my OB-GYN to set up a surgical consult, because it's time,\" Emily said. \"I hate to say it, I hate to think about it. But it's time.\"\n\nFor some women who were pregnant when Roe was overturned, the decision created stress and feelings of precarity around pregnancy itself. Caitlyn, a 33-year-old product designer from Richmond, Virginia, found out she was pregnant at the beginning of June. The fall of Roe so early in her pregnancy \"scared me shitless,\" she said, as did the uncertainty over what would happen in Virginia, where Republicans have previously tried to restrict abortion, and the GOP governor, Glenn Youngkin, is currently seeking to limit the procedure to 15 weeks . Caitlyn wondered: If she miscarried early in the pregnancy, would there be time to get pregnant again before further restrictions on her right to an abortion were enacted?\n\nCaitlyn and her husband started looking at the state's legislative calendar to determine when new laws might be enacted. In Virginia, new state laws are generally introduced in January and go into effect in July. \"I did not expect to be thinking about what the legislative landscape was going to be looking like when I was thinking about what decisions I was making for myself and my family. I just didn't even think that I'd be here,\" Caitlyn said.\n\nShe and her husband knew they only wanted to have one child. The possibility of an abortion ban coming into place this year, though, led them to a difficult question. If this pregnancy didn't work out, would they be willing to try again, knowing the possibility that new laws might prevent her from having an abortion if something went wrong?\n\n\"All of these different factors were the things we had to talk through,\" she said. \"And unfortunately, it means that this is the only shot for us, just given the priorities that we've set, which is: I'm just not willing to die for a couple of cells that are in my uterus,\" Caitlyn said. \"We decided this is going to be our only child, full stop. If we're fortunate enough and she's born healthy, that's really exciting. And we're really stoked. But if something goes wrong, this is the end of the line for us.\" After they made their decision, Caitlyn's husband got a vasectomy .\n\nShe thinks they would have ultimately chosen some form of sterilization after their child was born. But the decision that this would be her only attempt at having a child felt like it wasn't fully hers. \"It's depressing. It's frustrating,\" Caitlyn said. By January, she was nearing the end of her pregnancy, and thinking about the world her daughter would grow up in.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed sometimes by the responsibility that I feel to parent a girl and raise a daughter in this environment. I want her to be so many things. I mean, ultimately, I want her to be happy and I want her to be healthy. And I want her to be comfortable with whomever she is,\" Caitlyn said. \"The weight of knowing that the way that she's going to grow up, the rights that she's going to have, are going to be very different than my own experience - it's scary, as a parent. I don't know how I'm going to navigate it. But I just know that it's going to be very different for her than it was for me.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDemocrats don't have a quick fix for the end of Roe because there isn't one.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nSince Justice Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court , Democrats have suspected the end of Roe v. Wade was near. Those suspicions were confirmed in May, when a draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health was leaked to Politico and set off as blaring an alarm as possible about the coming end of national legalized abortion.\n\nGiven all the time they've had to prepare, the lack of any real plan or preparation by national Democratic leaders in anticipation of Friday's Supreme Court decision, in which the high court finally overturned Roe , has been stunning.\n\nNow that there are officially no federal abortion protections, many elected Democrats, especially in leadership, seem to be listless, resorting to platitudes of hope, perseverance, and voting as their best response to the court's conservative majority taking away a right. It's true that electing more Democrats could provide a long-term fix, but between now and the start of a new session of Congress, millions of Americans living in nearly half the country won't have a right to an abortion.\n\n\"We have an election coming up in November, and we need to elect pro-choice Democrats who are going to protect abortion rights, and give us the ability to pass legislation to protect those rights across this country,\" Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who is locked in a tough reelection race in Nevada, told Vox. \"That's the easiest and simplest path forward, and that's what I would ask everybody to understand and get behind.\"\n\nElected Democrats facing tough midterm elections know that just asking people to vote is not the rallying cry angry and frightened people want to hear. They are doing so anyway due to the severe limits on what the federal government can really do right now.\n\nPresident Joe Biden laid out that harsh reality in an address to the nation Friday, saying, \"the only way we can secure a woman's right to choose, and the balance that existed, is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law. No executive action from the president can do that, and if Congress, as it appears, lacks the votes to do that now, voters need to make their voices heard.\"\n\nDemocrats have no quick federal fixes now, even though they nominally control the government. They find themselves in a moment that shows the limits of electoral politics, as laws restricting abortion go into effect in at least four states as early as today.\n\nA legislative solution may be the only way to codify Roe at the federal level, and as Biden alluded to, that's not something easy to make happen. But in his speech on Friday, Biden did lay out some limited ways federal agencies can preserve access to abortion, both in states where it remains legal and through FDA-approved abortion pills, like mifepristone .\n\n\"Some states are saying they will try to ban or severely restrict access to these medications,\" he said. \"Today I am directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to secure these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\nSoon after the decision was made public, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department would \"use every tool at our disposal to protect reproductive freedom,\" including protecting the right for women to move freely to states where abortion is legal, to access information about reproductive care, and the ability to freely attain reproductive services at clinics where it is legal. He also reiterated the department's guidance that states cannot ban mifepristone since the FDA has already approved it.\n\nBut that guidance isn't settled law, and some states, like Louisiana, have already tried to limit access to the medication - and whether a state can outright ban the pill is a legal open question .\n\nThe bottom line is that no one is really sure what comes next - and beyond urging pro-abortion rights Americans to elect pro-abortion rights candidates in races up and down the ballot, a dissonance is emerging between how national Democrats are behaving and the fear that many Americans, particularly women, feel right now.\n\nDobbs decision day seemed to catch Washington politicians off guard. After voting on bipartisan gun safety legislation this afternoon, the House of Representatives is set to leave the capital for two weeks for the Fourth of July holiday. The Senate left the Hill yesterday - and some senators were on their way home when the news broke Friday.\n\nNBC News reported that White House staffers, and first lady Jill Biden, learned of the decision by push alerts on their phones - and the press office canceled the day's press briefing to make time for a sudden presidential address.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered somber remarks shortly after the opinion was released, but a video of her reciting a poem was what gained traction from that address. Another video of House Democrats singing \"God Bless America\" had accumulated about a million views in the afternoon. Both clips appear to be fueling a sense among progressive and activist Democrats that their action isn't meeting the moment. Meanwhile, riot police were being deployed to control angry crowds outside the court. As he ended his speech, Biden urged protesters to be peaceful and nonviolent.\n\nCongressional action is limited now. A Senate vote to codify Roe shortly after the draft opinion leaked failed to clear a filibuster ; the odds that the filibuster will be done away with now are low, despite its greatest defender, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, acknowledging that he now feels lied to by justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), one of two pro-abortion rights Republicans in the Senate, said in a statement Friday that she's working with Democrats on a new bill \"that would codify Roe .\" She did not elaborate on how the bipartisan legislation would clear the filibuster, however.\n\nAny legislative path hinges on who controls Congress next year. House Democrats are on track to lose their majority by a significant margin ; the Senate remains in play , however. Democrats would need to keep control of both chambers - and greatly expand their numbers in the Senate - to have any real hope of passing pro-abortion legislation. And that appears to be what the party is pinning its hopes on. In her remarks on Friday , Pelosi stressed Democrats need \"to get two more senators so we can change the obstacles to passing laws.\"\n\nBut \"wait, hope, and vote\" may not be a message satisfying to the Democratic base.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nMany reproductive health organizations want to codify stronger standards. They're not going to pick that fight this year.\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nWhen Joe Biden and Kamala Harris held their first joint campaign event of 2024 last month in northern Virginia, they left no doubt that codifying abortion rights would be central to the president's reelection bid. With the rally timed to honor what would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade , Biden stood under a large \"Restore Roe\" sign and beside supporters holding smaller posters to \"Defend Choice.\"\n\n\"We need the protections of Roe v. Wade in every state. And we can do it. You can do it,\" Biden stressed at the event. \"Give me a Democratic House of Representatives and give me a bigger - a bigger Democratic Senate, and we will pass a new law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade , and I will sign it immediately.\"\n\nIn subsequent campaign blasts, the Biden-Harris team reiterated the Roe message. \"A vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe ,\" said Julie Chávez Rodriguez, Biden's campaign manager. \"It's simple,\" the president tweeted to his nearly 34 million followers, under a graphic calling to \"Restore the Protections of Roe v. Wade Once and For All.\"\n\nAfter the 2022 and 2023 election cycles, it may not be surprising that Biden is running on an abortion rights platform. What's new, though, is that prominent abortion rights groups are biting their tongues about Roe and \"pro-choice\" messaging they disdain and have been trying to steer politicians away from.\n\nIn the weeks and months following the June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson decision , it was more common to hear influential leaders within the abortion rights movement talk about the necessity of going beyond Roe v. Wade, not going back to it. The old legal standard, they argued, was never good enough, and left too many people without access to the reproductive health care they needed.\n\nWhen a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill in summer 2022 to codify the legal protections that existed under Roe just before the Dobbs decision was issued, a coalition of reproductive rights groups came out quickly against it . Activists instead had their eyes set on the Women's Health Protection Act , a more sweeping federal bill that would not only restore the pre- Dobbs status quo but also ban most state-level restrictions as well as religious exemptions for health care providers. (WHPA passed the House in 2021 but failed twice in the Senate.)\n\nThe groups' opposition to anything incremental meant a more moderate, compromise effort to protect abortion rights in Congress was never seriously attempted after Roe .\n\nThe hope to go beyond Roe hasn't disappeared. Bolstered by decisive ballot measures to protect abortion rights over the last 18 months, election wins for Democrats who campaigned heavily on reproductive freedom, and surveys that suggest voters have grown even more supportive of abortion rights since Roe 's repeal , many activists have pressed Democrats to avoid using \" Roe\" language at all, and even steer clear of popular \"pro-choice\" messaging they believe helped normalize restricting abortion over the years.\n\nYet with the 2024 election now closer and stakes on abortion access even higher, reproductive rights groups have decided to swallow their concerns and enthusiastically endorse the president's reelection strategy. Vox reached out to a dozen abortion rights groups, and while many offered statements about the need to do more to protect abortion access, no organization went so far as to say they disagreed with the president on his call to restore Roe , or explicitly object to his language.\n\nMost groups handled the tension by saying they supported codifying \"real protections\" that restore the \"original promise\" of Roe - even if the restoration of Roe could mean restoring the legal rights available before Dobbs.\n\n\"Planned Parenthood Action Fund's long-term vision includes short-term strategies, and it's very simple,\" Alexis McGill Johnson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told Vox. \"This November, voters will have to decide between an administration that continues to work with us in the fight for freedom or an administration that caused our current public health crisis and will go further with a national abortion ban. We have a very clear choice between holding the line or descending further into what will be irreparable chaos and confusion.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood endorsed Biden's reelection bid last June and recently published a glowing review of the administration's record on abortion access. \"You can be certain that we are fighting for more than Roe v. Wade,\" McGill Johnson told me.\n\n\"We absolutely need to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade , and so much more,\" said Katie O'Connor, the National Women's Law Center's director of federal abortion policy. \"We are proud to have endorsed President Biden, and pleased he has committed to signing a bill that would lock the federal right to abortion into law,\" Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, added.\n\nBiden's campaign and surrogates are quick to point out that the president has already taken steps to protect abortion rights that go beyond the standards of Roe v. Wade. He's on record supporting the Women's Health Protection Act, and his administration has expanded access to abortion pills via telemedicine and at pharmacies .\n\nSo abortion rights groups and their congressional allies looking to pass stronger protections have decided to tolerate the president's Roe messaging, trusting his team will do more if reelected, despite what he's saying publicly now to voters.\n\n\"I support President Biden's campaign message to restore Roe and his administration's actions to defend abortion access,\" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren told me, drawing a distinction between his campaign rhetoric and his executive policies.\n\nWhether voters know that \"restoring Roe \" is not the president's end goal for abortion policy, though, is less clear. He's never specifically articulated that fact, and his surrogates are wary to do so on the record, either. They suggest, rather, that a person should be able to infer the president's policy goals based on a close reading of his administration's record.\n\nThe Biden campaign, for its part, wants to keep the conversation stationed on friendly political ground - where codifying or restoring Roe simply means legalizing or protecting abortion rights. This is safer territory, since most Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases and that overturning Roe v. Wade was a mistake . However, when one starts drilling down into the details about specific limits or restrictions, public opinion becomes murkier and more complex.\n\nWhere things get tricky is that Biden has not just praised Roe as a shorthand for legal abortion rights. He also continues to praise the specifics of the Supreme Court decision itself.\n\n\"It was a decision on a complex matter that drew a careful balance between a woman's right to choose earlier in her pregnancy and the state's ability to regulate later in her pregnancy,\" the president said when the Dobbs ruling came down. \"A decision with broad national consensus that most Americans of faiths and backgrounds found acceptable.\"\n\nEven at this recent Virginia campaign event in January the president went so far as to say, \"I believe Roe v. Wade got it right, and so do a majority of Americans.\"\n\nThis tendency to try and have it both ways on Roe has been frustrating for anti-abortion groups, as they point out the administration will praise the Supreme Court decision that endorsed limits and regulations but won't say today which, if any, limits they'd now support.\n\nFor example, last fall, when Harris was asked if there should be any limits on the right to an abortion, said at least five times that \"we need to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade\" but dodged clarifying what she meant by that in practice.\n\nSome Democratic political strategists say this waffling is simply necessary to get through November, to avoid Republicans spreading the lie that third-trimester abortions will become more common if Biden is reelected. Recently the Republican National Committee claimed in a press release that Biden supports \"abortion-on-demand up until the moment of birth and after.\"\n\nThe GOP also tried to attack Democrats in Virginia for supporting abortion \" up until birth \" in the recent 2023 election cycle, but voters didn't seem to buy it. While Americans do tend to be more uncomfortable with third-trimester abortions, they also seem to understand they are extremely rare , and are typically associated with fetal anomalies, threats to a mother's life, and barriers to care that delay access to the procedure.\n\nAs of now, the two major bills to codify abortion rights on the federal level are the Women's Health Protection Act and the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, which would legalize abortion before fetal viability and permit so-called conscience protections for health care providers who oppose abortion.\n\nWhen I asked a dozen abortion rights groups if they'd support codifying reproductive rights in legislation if the proposed federal bill did not go as far as the Women's Health Protection Act, most organizations demurred or declined to answer directly. Only Catholics for Choice offered a clear affirmative statement that they'd be willing to consider any bill that allows a pregnant person to choose abortion. \"This is not a time to make good legislation the enemy of the perfect,\" president Jamie Manson told me.\n\nA spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, one of the lead sponsors of the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, told Vox that he remains focused on passing his bill to codify \"the essential holdings of Roe and related cases to protect reproductive freedom and access to contraception.\" In a press interview following Biden's Virginia campaign event, Kaine stressed his bill is the only bipartisan one pending in Congress now to restore Roe as a statutory protection.\n\nDespite his campaign mantra to restore Roe , the Biden campaign declined to comment on whether the president would sign the Reproductive Freedom for All Act if it passed Congress.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith suggested lawmakers would be open to different pieces of legislation to protect abortion rights. \" Our goal is to restore women's reproductive freedoms,\" she told me. \"If that's the Women's Health Protection Act or something else remains to be seen, but that's where I stand.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nThe case should have a clear outcome, but a Republican Court overcomplicates everything that involves abortion.\n\nKerr v. Planned Parenthood asks the justices to render much of federal law unenforceable, in order to spite abortion providers.\n\nRed states are testing their power to restrict abortion nationwide.\n\nAnti-abortion activists are recalibrating for his second term.\n\nAlthough nothing is ever certain in this Supreme Court.\n\nAdvocates fear half-measures could undermine their long-term goals.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Reproductive Freedom for All Act reveals deeper debates about post-Roe America.\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nAmid threats over the last year that the Supreme Court might abolish the right to an abortion, Democrats and advocacy groups have used an imperfect but popular phrase as a synonym for protecting reproductive freedom: \"codify Roe .\"\n\n\"When we go back to Washington, we will be putting Roe v. Wade codification on the floor of the House to make sure that women everywhere have access to the reproductive health that they need,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pledged last September . When a draft of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision leaked in May, President Joe Biden stressed the need for \"legislation that codifies Roe , which I will work to pass and sign into law.\"\n\nA bill introduced earlier this month aims to do exactly that, writing into law the holdings of Supreme Court decisions that guaranteed the right to contraception and to abortion before fetal viability, usually in the 22nd to 24th week of pregnancy.\n\nBut translating abortion-related court decisions into legislative language that everyone can agree on has turned out to be more difficult and controversial than lawmakers have publicly acknowledged.\n\nThe bill, known as the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, is a bipartisan effort, sponsored by Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Kyrsten Sinema. It has sparked outrage among the leaders of abortion rights groups: They argue it would not actually codify key Supreme Court decisions and could even be a step backward from what Americans had before Dobbs. The measure does much less to protect abortion rights than the Women's Health Protection Act , abortion rights groups' favored bill, which passed the House but has failed twice in the Senate.\n\nTheir reaction underscores a key debate over Democrats' legislative strategy in post- Roe America. Even as Democrats say they want to codify Roe , national reproductive rights groups and their allies in Congress see a political window to move beyond Roe 's weak framework and more meaningfully protect abortion access.\n\nThese groups, including Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and a dozen others , think it's unlikely that the Kaine-Collins bill could attract much Republican support beyond its two co-sponsors. Energized by recent pro-abortion rights victories, they express confidence about sticking to their original plan: elect two more senators, maintain control of the House, and then overturn the filibuster to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, which would not only restore the pre- Dobbs status quo but dismantle a slew of state restrictions on abortion.\n\n\"We have this really clear political opportunity to realize some big, big wins,\" NARAL president Mini Timmaraju said. \"And we owe these folks who are at risk of losing their lives because of things like ectopic pregnancies, we owe them the biggest, boldest solution possible.\"\n\nThe Kaine-Collins bill, by contrast, is intentionally less ambitious. \"It's like a time machine bill,\" Kaine said. \"We wanted to put something on the table that would give back Americans exactly what they had, and lock in a statutory protection that women had relied on for 50 years. Not expanding, not subtracting.\"\n\nVox spoke with top Democratic lawmakers, legislative aides and strategists, leaders of reproductive rights groups, and legal scholars to understand the choices and challenges ahead for federal abortion policy. The interviews illuminated a simmering debate over whether it's worth trying to return to the legal frameworks of June 23, 2022 - the day before Dobbs was decided - and deeper divisions over what baseline abortion rights the federal government should, or realistically can, guarantee.\n\nIn addition to enshrining the right to contraception, the bill prohibits state rules that impose an \"undue burden\" on abortion before fetal viability, the same standard established by the Supreme Court in its 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision.\n\nOutright bans are illegal under this undue burden framework, but restrictions that significantly curtail access to abortion have often been upheld. The Reproductive Freedom for All Act also affirms health care workers' right to refuse to provide abortion for religious reasons - something currently allowed in over 40 states, and a key demand from its Republican co-sponsors.\n\nThe bill sponsors readily admit there are not 60 votes in the Senate to pass the legislation, and Collins, Murkowski, and Sinema do not support overturning the filibuster. But the sponsors say they wanted to signal that a bipartisan majority of their chamber supports codifying Roe . (Kaine and Sinema also support the Women's Health Protection Act, but Collins, Murkowski, and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin opposed that legislation, depicting it as too expansive.)\n\nKaine compared his bill to lawmakers who fought for gun control when they also lacked 60 votes. \"We spent a decade pushing for that, and then tragedies made the Senate move ,\" he said. \"I think life post- Dobbs is a series of tragedies, and we have a sense that real life is going to push votes our way.\"\n\nThe response to Kaine-Collins from reproductive rights groups and some Democratic lawmakers has ranged from chilly to hostile, with objections falling into four general buckets, of varying legitimacy.\n\nThe first objection - voiced by virtually every national advocacy group for reproductive rights - is that the Reproductive Freedom for All Act does not include explicit enough language to bar pre-viability abortion bans, like the 15-week ban in Mississippi that sparked the Dobbs case to begin with. For this reason, they say, the bill doesn't actually codify Roe v. Wade .\n\nThis is the most controversial objection. The bill clearly states a government cannot impose an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion before fetal viability, and that fetal viability is determined by a woman's attending doctor, not the state. While it's likely that medically unnecessary restrictions such as mandatory waiting periods could withstand the murky undue burden standard, an outright ban is a different question.\n\nKaine says the bill was specifically written to prevent pre-viability bans. \"I practiced civil rights law for 18 years and virtually any intellectually honest judge would look at this and say Congress says you can't impose an undue burden, which a ban clearly is,\" he said. \"While you may have rogue judges here or there, returning to the undue burden standard would give the judiciary not just the tools but also the mandate to throw out those kinds of laws.\"\n\nSo what's going on? Pressed for answers, reproductive health groups and senators pointed to a concurring opinion in Dobbs from Chief Justice John Roberts. Writing alone, Roberts argued that the right to an abortion does not necessarily need to be paired with fetal viability. Roberts suggested Mississippi's 15-week ban could potentially be legal, as long as a woman had a \"reasonable opportunity\" to get an abortion before then.\n\n\"Senator Kaine's legislation is missing the core protection of Roe , which prohibited any ban on abortion before viability, and replaces it with a dangerous legal standard that could permit extremist state laws like Mississippi's 15-week ban,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Vox in a statement. \"This bill is closer to codifying Chief Justice Roberts's concurrence in the Dobbs decision than it is to codifying Roe , and I do not support it.\"\n\nBut the idea that John Roberts's interpretation of the undue burden standard - which was rejected by the Court's five-member conservative majority - would triumph now is unpersuasive, said several legal experts.\n\nBen Eidelson, a Harvard constitutional law professor, said the Reproductive Freedom for All Act \"very clearly precludes pre-viability bans\" and noted the Roberts concurrence \"really has no legal relevance here.\"\n\nThe majority opinion in Dobbs - not the concurring one - would define the legal backdrop for interpreting what Congress does next, Eidelson said. \"It would be extraordinary for the Court to turn around, after Congress relies on that, and say that actually Roe and Casey meant something completely different than they themselves had said or anyone ever thought,\" he added.\n\nSherif Girgis, a Notre Dame law professor who argued the Supreme Court should overturn Roe , said the Kaine-Collins bill prohibits abortion bans \"even a little bit\" before viability and \"there is no serious argument to the contrary.\"\n\nGirgis noted that \"every judge at every level of the judiciary\" who has considered the abortion question in the last 30 years - including very conservative judges like James Chiun-Yue Ho on the Fifth Circuit and Amul Thapar on the Sixth - has held that Casey's undue burden standard precludes any pre-viability ban, and that even Roberts didn't disagree in Dobbs.\n\nRachel Rebouché, the dean of Temple Law School and co-author of an influential paper on coming legal battles in a post- Roe America, also said she doesn't see how Roberts's concurrence would be significant here. \"Even if the bill is not explicit as you might want it to be, it is pretty explicit,\" she said. \"And even if John Roberts argues that Casey never necessarily intended the viability line to be the line Roe prohibits, there is no other vote on the Court for that view.\"\n\nThere are a few dissenting scholars. Leah Litman, a constitutional law professor at the University of Michigan, argues the operative section of the Kaine-Collins bill needs to be more specific, given Roberts's opinion in Dobbs and because states like Texas and Mississippi, and conservative groups, have been arguing that undue burden doesn't necessarily prohibit pre-viability bans.\n\n\"That gives the Court wiggle room to say it's not so clear,\" she said. \"It's a sloppy bill that is foolish and naive and fails to take the federal courts as they are.\"\n\nThe second objection is practical: The Kaine-Collins bill doesn't have the votes. Timmaraju, president of NARAL, describes the Reproductive Freedom for All Act as a \"political stunt that should not be taken seriously\" given that its sponsors have not backed overturning the filibuster.\n\nAdvocates say their best path to protect abortion rights is to elect two more Democratic senators to overcome its last failed vote of 49-51. Democrats are favored to at least retain control of the Senate next year, but to lose the House . Performing well enough in November, though, doesn't mean the filibuster's death is a foregone conclusion; just as many lawmakers pledged support for Medicare-for-all only when the possibility seemed remote , more objections to ending the filibuster might emerge if it were a real possibility.\n\nThere's a third objection: that the Reproductive Freedom for All Act is inadequate because it would invariably return questions back to the same anti-abortion federal judiciary that just overthrew Roe. This objection is a little tricky, since the Women's Health Protection Act would also get embroiled in legal challenges, and be reviewed by those same hostile judges.\n\nBut advocates say at least the Women's Health Protection Act is much more specific on what types of restrictions would violate the law, an improvement over the \"undue burden\" standard that leaves so much to court discretion.\n\nMary Ziegler, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law who has authored several books on reproductive rights history, said federal courts would likely strike down both bills because Congress has limited authority to legislate in this area.\n\n\"It's either going to be relying on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, or the commerce clause, and quite likely you'll get a conservative Supreme Court that says Congress doesn't have the authority to do either of those things,\" she said. \"Which is a reason why there will have to be some kind of conversation about court reform, because there would be real jeopardy for any federal legislation protecting abortion rights.\"\n\nSarah Standiford, the national campaign director for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, agreed there are real hurdles right now for federal bills. \"I think there is a hunger for Congress to solve this problem, but the solution is not simple, and the solution is going to be using every avenue we have, and the fact is many of those avenues are at the state level,\" she told Vox. \"We have to be honest with ourselves about the limitations that structurally exist in Congress.\"\n\nThe final category of objection is the biggest one: that restoring the Roe and Casey standards would not do enough to address the abortion care crisis in the United States. Before Dobbs, it was perfectly legal to enact medically unnecessary restrictions that crippled abortion clinics and which made terminating pregnancies practically too difficult to do. The overturn of Roe has wiped the slate clean, and activists see an opportunity to fight for stronger protections.\n\nIn explaining her objection to the Kaine-Collins bill, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) told Politico it doesn't \"fully [guarantee] a woman's right to reproductive choice.\" Warren said returning to the status quo before Dobbs \"is not good enough.\" A joint statement from 15 reproductive rights, health, and justice groups stressed they're looking for \"legislative solutions that make abortion truly accessible.\"\n\nTimmaraju, NARAL's president, emphasized that activists have developed a much clearer understanding of how restrictions permitted under the undue burden standard can decimate access to care. \"To those who say we want to go back in a time machine to the day before Dobbs, that was still a bad day,\" she said.\n\nDemocratic senators and activists also stress the Kaine-Collins bill does not explicitly prohibit SB 8, the novel citizen-enforced abortion ban that Texas passed last September and which several states are looking to copy.\n\nThe Women's Health Protection Act doesn't explicitly bar these bans either, but does include language its drafters hope could grant advocates grounds to challenge the \"bounty hunters\" in court.\n\nKaine, for his part, thinks his bill would protect against laws like SB 8. \"A bounty hunting law is an undue burden, and a six-week ban is before viability,\" he said. \"Our bill would wipe out all those state schemes.\"\n\nEidelson, the constitutional law professor, thinks that if Congress passed the Reproductive Health for All Act and if the Supreme Court upheld it (both big ifs), that would, in fact, substantially undercut SB 8 and similar laws. Much of the chilling effect in Texas over the last year stemmed from the interaction of SB 8's threat of liability and pending uncertainty over Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe Kaine-Collins bill's opponents aren't just disinclined to accept the pre- Roe status quo - they're less certain they need to compromise. An increasing share of Democrats and independents say the Dobbs decision has motivated them to vote in November. Advocates are energized by the recent ballot victory in Kansas , two special elections where Democrats outperformed their 2020 vote share, and midterm polls that show voters are concerned about abortion rights. Democratic Senate staffers say privately that there's no reason to tamp down on bold rhetoric now, and there will be time to moderate later if the political landscape shifts.\n\n\"I think the thing that is most useful for abortion rights advocates to be doing now is to be as aggressively chest-thumping as possible,\" one senior aide told me, speaking anonymously to candidly describe Senate discussions. \"It helps to position ourselves so that when the next meltdown comes, what emerges out of it will be as strong as possible.\"\n\nThe strategically optimal path to federal abortion rights is for now unsettled, but the stakes are high. Ziegler, of UC Davis, said she's not surprised the national groups aren't defending bills to codify Roe and Casey now that those decisions have been overturned.\n\n\"I do think Casey from the standpoint of most national groups was never good enough,\" she said. \"I also think from the standpoint of a person of color living in Arizona with a fetal personhood law, Casey probably looks awfully good right now.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Wade . But many of those states are not willing to give new babies and their families the educational, medical, or financial support they need to lead a healthy life. That could leave tens of thousands of future children unnecessarily disadvantaged and living in poverty.\n\nThe precise effect on new births from the 22 states set to enact broad abortion bans now that Roe v. Wade is overturned is impossible to predict. But public health experts like Diana Greene Foster - the lead researcher on the Turnaway Study , an enormous survey project that tracked the long-term effects of receiving or being denied an abortion - expect a meaningful increase in the number of women with an unwanted pregnancy who nevertheless give birth. Middlebury College economics professor Caitlin Knowles Myers anticipates as many as 75,000 people who want an abortion but can't get one will end up giving birth in the first year after Roe is overturned.\n\nThose births will predominately be in the states with the most draconian post- Roe abortion restrictions. And with a few exceptions, those 22 states rank in the bottom half of states in the comprehensive support they provide to children and their families, according to the State-by-State Spending on Kids Dataset compiled by Brown University's Margot Jackson and her colleagues. The disparities can be enormous: Vermont spends three times as much money on education, health care, and other economic support for children as Utah.\n\nShould the Supreme Court remove federal abortion protections, \"there's really no reason to think those patterns would change,\" Jackson told me before the Court's abortion decision. \"The potential consequences, the very likely consequences, would be a pretty substantial widening of the stark and striking inequalities that already exist in social support available to mothers and children.\"\n\nFamilies will be adding a new child in states that have made it harder for them to afford food and housing. More children could end up living in poverty, their households struggling to pay for bare necessities. Research suggests their parents will be less likely to purchase items that help with the child's development, and they may struggle to hit early milestones compared to their peers in other states.\n\nThe children born in these circumstances will start life a few steps behind, all because their political leaders strove to ban abortion without offering support to the children who would be born if their aims were achieved.\n\nUltimately, abortion bans may mean more babies are born to people uncertain of their ability to take care of them, in states that refuse to provide for them. As documented in the Turnaway Study, women often cite their finances or wanting to take care of the children they already have when explaining why they'd want an abortion.\n\n\"Most women seeking abortions are already experiencing financial hardships,\" Foster writes in her 2020 book. Specifically, about half of the 1,000 women who participated in the Turnaway Study were living in poverty, a number consistent with national averages of women terminating a pregnancy. Three-fourths of the women in the study said they already didn't have enough money for food, housing, and transportation.\n\nAccording to the Turnaway Study's surveys, 40 percent of women who were seeking an abortion said they were not financially prepared, and 29 percent said they needed to focus on the children they already have. Another 20 percent said that having a baby would interfere with their own future opportunities, and 12 percent said they could not provide the kind of life that they would want for their baby. (The participants could give more than one answer and most did.)\n\nA parent's ability to provide for their child is, in part, dependent on where they live. The State Spending on Kids Dataset has collected state fiscal records on everything from K-12 education and higher ed to child tax credits to food stamps and cash assistance. Urban Institute scholars took that information and found these enormous disparities in how much different states spend in total to support a child and their family.\n\nSome of these disparities likely reflect the differences in cost of living; generally, it costs more money to subsist in a blue state on the coast than in a red state in the interior. But some of it is a matter of ideology, with the correlation between a less generous welfare state and more abortion restrictions being strong.\n\nIn a 2018 essay , Yale law professor Reva Siegel laid out a number of ways in which that pattern held. For example, none of the 10 most anti-abortion states have passed their own family leave policies; eight of the 10 most permissive states had. Only one of the 10 most restrictive states had enacted protections for pregnant workers. Most did not require that contraception be covered by private health insurance.\n\n\"States with the most abortion restrictions tend to have implemented fewer policies known to support women's and children's well-being,\" concludes a 2017 overview from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health. Siegel argues in her review that this discord reveals that these states are more interested in restricting a woman's reproductive choices than in protecting children's well-being.\n\nIt's not just how much money a state spends on a family's welfare but how the money is spent that matters, Jackson told me. Broadly speaking, more progressive states tend to put their spending to direct assistance - \"sending families a check\" - while more conservative states expend their dollars for specific services, such as pregnancy prevention or marriage promotion. The first is more effective in keeping families out of poverty than the second. One 2019 paper published in Socio-Economic Review by Columbia University's Zachary Parolin found that states instituting policies that prioritize discouraging lone motherhood over providing cash assistance had impoverished about 250,000 Black children yearly.\n\nRepublican-led states are also more likely to close off access to welfare by restricting eligibility, such as through so-called family caps, which deny families that are already enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program any additional assistance if they have another child. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , 12 states, largely concentrated in the South, still have such laws on the books.\n\nWhen people denied an abortion end up giving birth, their fears about their financial ability to raise a child tend to come true. \"We find that the reasons women give for wanting an abortion strongly predict the consequences they experience when they are denied that abortion,\" Foster wrote.\n\nThe Turnaway Study looked at women's economic well-being six months after they either received an abortion or were denied one. Researchers found that 61 percent of those who were turned away were living in poverty compared to 45 percent of those who received an abortion. The first group was significantly more likely to be poor over the next four years.\n\nThe welfare the women unable to access abortions did receive helped ameliorate the loss of income and educational opportunities; the study found no meaningful difference in income for the women who got an abortion versus the women who gave birth. But because the latter was raising at least one more child than the former, they were still more likely to be living in poverty.\n\nBeing denied abortion led to a $1,750 increase in past-due bills, the study found. The incidences of bad financial events - evictions, bankruptcies, court judgments on unpaid bills - increased by 81 percent for the women who were turned away.\n\nThe children of a mother who was denied abortion were more likely to live in poverty, more likely to live in a household that receives public assistance, and more likely to live with adults who say they can not afford food, housing, and transportation.\n\nThose are national trends, across more than 30 states. But other research suggests that children born in states with less generous safety nets will face disadvantages compared to their peers in more generous states, when you look at the benefits conferred by stronger financial and social support.\n\nOne study co-authored by Jackson found that lower-income families in states with generous public assistance spend more money on things that are likely to help improve their child's development, such as clothing, toys, games, arts and crafts, and books. A forthcoming study utilizing the same state-level data showed that more social spending - on both health care and non-health care programs - is associated with fewer babies being born with low birth weights and fewer preterm births among mothers with less than a high school education.\n\nIt's common for anti-abortion advocates to argue that eliminating abortion protects the lives of children. But without increases in their welfare spending, many states set to revoke abortion rights will create harmful conditions for children, limiting their access to necessities like food, and the opportunities created by education.\n\nAnd that puts the real motivations of the anti-abortion crusade in doubt.\n\n\"It is conventional to assume that states restrict women's access to abortion out of an interest in protecting new life,\" Siegel points out in her 2018 law review. \"If this is in fact the concern that animates abortion restrictions, these values ought to guide policies outside as well as inside the abortion context.\"\n\nIf states want to protect young lives, Siegel notes, they could have enacted policies such as family leave or could even expand contraception access, limiting the number of abortions without also limiting a person's reproductive choices.\n\nBut that's not what these states do. Instead, they restrict abortion access and limit the public assistance available to new parents and babies. In an amicus brief for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Mississippi case that has now overturned Roe v. Woe , Siegel and her co-authors Serena Mayeri and Melissa Murray argue states' legal arguments in favor of their abortion bans should only hold weight if they are willing to support a child who is born out of an unwanted pregnancy that can't be terminated:\n\nMississippi could provide care and support for individuals who wish: to avoid pregnancy, to bear children who will not languish in poverty, to preserve their own or their children's health, or to safeguard their ability to provide for existing children. Instead, Mississippi chooses to prevent women from making the most intimate, consequential decisions for themselves and to coerce women into giving birth under dangerous, demeaning conditions.\n\nThe state's abortion ban, Siegel and her co-authors argued, \"thus functions more as a tool of control than as an expression of care for Mississippi's women and children.\" But such arguments had no purchase at the Supreme Court .\n\nInstead, the states that are least capable of supporting any uptick in births are on the brink of outlawing abortion. Families and children will pay the price.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe devastating impact of Dobbs, by the numbers.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nIt's been nearly one year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion via the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health decision. In the months since, abortion access has been mostly banned in 14 states , stringent gestational limits have been put in place in several others, and the approval of medication abortion has been challenged in the federal courts.\n\nSuch policies have left both patients and providers scrambling to navigate harsh new restrictions and penalties. For many patients, these policies have meant traveling out of state, incurring serious risks to their own health, and in some cases, carrying unwanted pregnancies to term . For providers, the end of Roe has meant fears of being punished for providing abortions, possible discipline from state medical boards , and, in states where abortion remains legal, an influx of patients from other places.\n\n\"We hear stories of doctors who are afraid to provide care, who don't know what the legal implications might be,\" says Morgan Hopkins, the president of All Above All, a reproductive rights advocacy group. \"We hear the same thing from patients, confusion about what the law might be, and needing to travel.\"\n\nOverall, Dobbs has made it harder for people to obtain an abortion in many states. Here's a look at how a year of abortion restrictions have affected people's lives, by the numbers:\n\nThe impact of such policies is substantial: Data from the Society of Family Planning showed that the number of legal abortions went down 6 percent in the six months following the Dobbs decision compared to the months prior, amounting to more than 32,000 fewer legal abortions nationwide.\n\nThose statistics suggest that some women likely carried unwanted pregnancies to term because they were unable to obtain an abortion. A Guardian story examining some of these cases included the experience of a 29-year-old Texan named Samantha Casiano, who was forced to carry her pregnancy to term even though her baby had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a condition that meant the baby would die shortly after birth.\n\nDenials of abortions can have harmful consequences for women's health such as childbirth complications and chronic pain, as well as negative economic outcomes for their children like an increased likelihood of living in poverty , the influential Turnaway Study found. Beginning in 2007, that study followed the experiences of women who were able to obtain abortions and those who were forced to carry their pregnancies to term, and concluded that denials of abortions had a major adverse effect on women who endured one.\n\nForcing people to travel further to obtain abortions poses a high cost. Not only does it mean that abortion is more expensive, it also means that people have to budget significantly more time for such procedures.\n\nParticularly in the South - where several states including Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi have near total bans - people have had to travel extensively to find care. Alison Dreith, the director of strategic partnerships at the Midwest Access Coalition, an abortion fund, says they've seen a major jump in people from Texas calling for help obtaining an abortion outside the state. Those patients have had to travel as far as Illinois to receive care. The JAMA study found that for women in Texas and Louisiana, the average travel time for an abortion was 7 hours longer than prior to the Dobbs decision.\n\nBlack, Hispanic, and American Indian women were among the groups disproportionately affected by the increases in travel time, the study also determined .\n\nIn 2021, for example, the average spending the New Orleans Abortion Fund covered per patient was $308; that went up to $729 in 2022. \"The distance people are traveling changed really rapidly. Flight prices are up, hotel prices are up,\" Megan Jeyifo, the executive director of the Chicago Abortion Fund, told Vox.\n\nAbortion funds have become a major resource for people who are unable to afford care on their own, though added costs and logistical barriers might deter some from seeking out the procedure at all. These funds have also faced the pressures of growing costs, and have relied on donations as one source of financial support.\n\nThat increase has meant clinics and doctors in states where abortion remains legal are dealing with much higher caseloads than previously. \"We've had hospitals in Chicago expand their days that they do procedures because they're not only carrying the Midwest, they're carrying much of the South,\" says Jeyifo.\n\nThe surge of patients has also meant longer wait times for abortions in certain places , a delay that could come with major health risks, including infections and heavy bleeding, for the people involved. \"That wait time is so critical for gestational limits, for the cost of the procedure, for people's safety and security,\" says Dreith.\n\nProviders are finding it more difficult to deal with emergencies because there can be uncertainty about whether an abortion is allowed : in states with exceptions for a woman's life, for example, there's ambiguity about which conditions qualify.\n\nAs a result, providers might be hesitant to perform an abortion or related care if they don't know for sure that it's legal to do so. This has been evident in cases in which women were denied vital care for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages due to physician worries about violating recent abortion restrictions in states like Tennessee and Texas .\n\nDue to the confusion that some state laws have raised about when it's acceptable to perform an abortion, some physicians fear that these restrictions could contribute to an already devastating maternal mortality crisis in the US. Ahead of Dobbs , US maternal mortality was already the highest of any developed country, affecting 32.9 people per 100,000 live births in 2021 . Now, some providers worry the legal ramifications of performing an abortion could leave people forced to go through unnecessarily risky pregnancies, or absent the immediate care they need in an emergency.\n\n\"Without abortion care, we're going to see maternal mortality go up,\" Tennessee physician Nikki Zite told ProPublica .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe case should have a clear outcome, but a Republican Court overcomplicates everything that involves abortion.\n\nKerr v. Planned Parenthood asks the justices to render much of federal law unenforceable, in order to spite abortion providers.\n\nRed states are testing their power to restrict abortion nationwide.\n\nAnti-abortion activists are recalibrating for his second term.\n\nAlthough nothing is ever certain in this Supreme Court.\n\nAdvocates fear half-measures could undermine their long-term goals.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow police can find out where you've been, and what you can do about it.\n\nby Sara Morrison\n\nTech companies are scrambling to adjust their data privacy practices in response to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and subsequent criminalizing of abortion in several states , as the larger public realizes that the data those services collect could be used to prosecute abortion seekers. Google, for example, recently announced that it will automatically delete location data if people visit medical facilities, including abortion clinics (it still, of course, collects that data). And the period tracker app Flo is introducing an \" anonymous mode \" that is supposed to let users delete any identifiable information from their profiles.\n\nIf you've never cared all that much about how and why you're constantly being surveilled online before, you probably have a lot of questions about how all of this works now - especially when it comes to reproductive health data and what can be used against you. We've answered some of those questions here, from how scared you should be of period apps to what you can do to keep your private life private ... as much as that's possible, anyway.\n\nThis seems to be the biggest question people have about online privacy with regard to the Roe reversal. The short answer is: Yes. If you want to keep your reproductive health and menstrual data private - especially if you're worried about that data being part of a criminal investigation - don't put it in an app.\n\nThe longer answer is that when it comes to online privacy and health privacy, deleting a period tracker app is like taking a teaspoon of water out of the ocean. The current anxiety about period apps is understandable, given the purpose that they serve. But it's also myopic. There are countless and more effective ways that interested parties can track your pregnancy status (expectant parents buy a lot of things, so knowing when someone gets pregnant to target them with ads can be lucrative) and law enforcement can do even more if they're investigating you for getting an abortion in a state where it's illegal (more on that later). The data from a period tracker app will only tell them so much, and it will only tell them the information you've given it.\n\nThat said, period tracker or fertility apps have a bad reputation when it comes to privacy, and they deserve it. Flo was once caught sending data to various third parties including Facebook and Google, despite privacy policies indicating that it wouldn't. Glow was dinged for \"serious privacy and basic security failures.\" Stardust shared user phone numbers with a third party, and its \"end-to-end encryption\" claims have been walked back.\n\nSince a draft opinion indicating that Roe would be reversed leaked in May, and period apps got more scrutiny than perhaps ever before, many of them have scrambled to assure users that their data is safe or that they are implementing additional protections . While some period trackers are better than others , the only way to be sure that no one can get anything about you from a period app is not to use them at all.\n\nYes. People have been menstruating for as long as people have existed. Period apps, smartphones, and even the internet have only been around for a fraction of that time. If you keep track of your cycle on, say, a paper calendar, that data isn't going to be sent to third parties or stored in some company's cloud for law enforcement to access. Digital calendars exist, too, like Google's Calendar and Apple's iCal. You might feel better about those because they aren't expressly for period tracking, and Google and Apple don't send your data to third parties like some of those period apps do. But that doesn't mean that data is completely protected, as I'll explain later.\n\nYou can also use apps that don't upload your information to a cloud, as Consumer Reports suggested . That data can still be accessed if someone gets control of the device it's on, but that's also true for paper calendars.\n\nIt's understandable why people are focusing on period apps. They specifically deal with reproductive health, and deleting an app gives people what appears to be a fast and simple solution and a feeling of agency. But the truth is that period tracker apps are very low on the list of things you should worry about when it comes to online privacy and abortions. You can delete an app, but that won't make an entire ecosystem built on knowing as much as possible about you disappear. If abortion is illegal where you live and law enforcement is investigating you for possibly getting one, even the most privacy-centric company can be forced to give law enforcement whatever data they have on you. And you can be forced to give them whatever data you have, too.\n\nLet's look at Google, because it likely has more data on you than anyone else. Depending on which of its services you use (or which of its services the apps you use or websites you visit use) Google knows a lot about you, such as where you go, what you search the internet for, the websites you visit, the emails you send and receive, the text messages you send, and the photos you take. Google doesn't necessarily want to share this data with anyone else, because being the sole owner of it is one of Google's competitive advantages. And it's not going to hand it over to, say, an anti-abortion group that's looking to weaponize it.\n\nBut Google doesn't have a choice if law enforcement demands it and gets the right court order for it. That's in its privacy policy : \"We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\"\n\nEvery other company is going to have a version of that clause. Even Apple, which has a better reputation for privacy than its Big Tech peers, will give data to the police if it's compelled to do so. When it refused to help the FBI access iPhones owned by suspected terrorists, that was because Apple didn't have a backdoor into its devices and wouldn't make one. But any data those people had uploaded to iCloud, like backups of those devices - that is, the data Apple itself possessed - it did provide.\n\nGoogle, for what it's worth, has responded to the Roe news by announcing that it will automatically delete location data around certain places, like abortion or fertility clinics. That should mean that police can't get it because there's nothing for them to get. But there's still plenty of potentially incriminating evidence left that they can find.\n\nWe don't know if and how law enforcement will go after abortion seekers, but we do know how they've obtained and used data to go after others. That includes the case of a woman who was suspected of killing her baby just after it was born, and another woman who was accused of intentionally inducing a miscarriage. In those cases, texts, web searches, and emails taken from the women's own phones were used as evidence against them. There's nothing to suggest that police won't do the same when investigating people suspected of obtaining now-illegal abortions.\n\nWhen the Roe reversal decision first leaked, there were several stories showing just how much of your data is in the hands of random data brokers and how easy it is for that data to fall into the hands of anyone else. That data is \"de-identified,\" but depending on what data is collected and shared, it may be possible to re-identify someone from it. For example, last year, a priest was outed by data from Grindr. (One important caveat: While the publication that outed him said the data it used was \"commercially available,\" it never said it got that data from buying it.)\n\nThe chances that a private party will purchase data and be able to figure out that you got an abortion and who you are is, frankly, pretty remote. It's the people who have access to much more specific and sensitive data - the police - you have to worry about, if abortion is illegal where you live. But nothing is impossible, especially when so much of our data is sent to so many places.\n\nProbably not as much as you think. First of all, not every single medical or health-related service is covered by HIPAA. Those anti-abortion pregnancy centers collect plenty of sensitive, reproductive health-specific data, and they may not be subject to HIPAA's privacy rules, even if they perform medical procedures - and even if they reference HIPAA in their privacy policies.\n\nBut let's say you see a provider who is a covered entity. Then, yes, your health information is protected. Unless you're breaking the law, in which case police may be able to get those records or certain details in them. The Department of Health and Human Services, which enforces HIPAA, recently issued new guidance on reproductive health care disclosures in response to the Roe reversal, stressing that such disclosures can only be made under very select circumstances.\n\nAgain, what data law enforcement or data brokers can get on you depends on what you give them. Google can only give the police what it has. Services like Signal and Proton that use end-to-end encryption and don't store your data don't have anything to give the police no matter how many warrants they're served with. But if you have that data on your device and police get access to that, all the end-to-end encryption in the world won't save you. That's why Signal, for instance, offers a feature called disappearing messages, which will permanently delete messages in a chat after a set amount of time from every device in the chat.\n\nThere are also things you can do to prevent your data from being collected, but these might involve more steps and technical knowledge than you're willing, or know how, to take. That's especially true if you're only trying to figure it out when the need for privacy suddenly arises and you have other things to worry about - like when you're dealing with an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nWhich means your best bet is to read and get familiar with these measures now, when you have the time and emotional bandwidth to figure out what you can and want to do and practice incorporating them into your daily life. Some of them may not be as difficult or inaccessible as you think, especially when you do them often enough that they become automatic.\n\nThe Verge recently published some good and clear advice. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a guide . And Gizmodo's privacy how-to tells you all the things you can do and why you should do them. Nothing is foolproof in a world with few privacy protections and an economy based on furtive data collection, but these are measures you can take that should significantly reduce your data exposure.\n\nThe best privacy protections are the ones our government has yet to give us: data privacy laws. The Roe reversal has made the consequences of not having them more clear than ever, and lawmakers have already introduced Senate and House bills specifically addressing health data in response to the decision. You can urge your representatives to support and push for those bills to be passed, as well as some of the broader consumer privacy bills that have been introduced (or are reportedly soon to be introduced). Those may limit the data companies can share or sell to other companies, and even the data they can collect in the first place.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow the company's transition to for-profit will affect everyone.\n\nWhy you need a battery-powered house.\n\nComputing has a big energy appetite.

      "text": "1 year since Roe v. Wade was overturned: Abortion in the US told in graphics\n\nPublic support for abortion has risen since the Dobbs decision.\n\nThis weekend marks the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade , a decision that gave states the power to make their own laws on abortion.\n\nSince the decision -- known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization -- the abortion landscape of the U.S. has dramatically changed, including where bans are in place, how many abortions are performed in states and the support levels for abortion.\n\nHere's what one-year post-Roe looks like in graphics:\n\nBefore the Dobbs decision, Oklahoma and Texas were the only states with bans restricting abortion after 20 weeks, state laws show. Other states tried to pass similar bans, but saw those efforts blocked by judges,\n\nSince the decision, released on June 24 of last year, at least 15 states have ceased nearly all abortion services, according to an ABC News tally.\n\nThirteen states have near-total or total abortion bans: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. Georgia has a six-week ban.\n\nWisconsin providers have also stopped performing abortions, but this is due to confusion about the status of the state's pre-Roe ban, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a research group that focuses on sexual and reproductive health.\n\nOther restrictions in the U.S. include a 12-week ban in Nebraska at present, and North Carolina beginning next month; a 15-week ban in Arizona and Florida; and an 18-week ban in Utah.\n\nSince the Dobbs decision, thousands of people have been unable to obtain abortions in their home states or neighboring states.\n\nEstimates from #WeCount , a research project from the nonprofit Society of Family Planning -- and provided exclusively to FiveThirtyEight -- showed there were 24,290 fewer legal abortions from July 2022 to March 2023 compared to a period before Dobbs.\n\nThe number of abortions per month in each state, compared to the averages before Dobbs, rose or fell depending on the legal status of abortion in the state, the estimates showed.\n\nWhile support for abortion was high in the U.S. prior to the Dobbs decision, it has now increased.\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to views on abortion by trimester. A Gallup poll published last week found 69% of respondents believe it should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy, a record-high and two percentage points higher than last year.\n\nAlthough support for abortions in the second and third trimesters was lower than for the first trimester, record-high numbers were in favor of the procedure in later stages of pregnancy, the poll found.\n\nThe poll found 37% of respondents supported second-trimester abortions and 22% supported third trimester abortions, up from 36% and 20%, respectively.\n\nAbortion providers in states where the procedure remains legal and who offer telehealth services say they've seen an increase in patients since the Dobbs decision.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Illinois said in a release this month it has seen a 54% increase in abortion patients, both those receiving medication abortions and surgical abortions.\n\nHey Jane, a virtual clinic that mails abortion pills, said in a report published Tuesday it had seen a 164% increase in the last year.\n\nThe end of Roe v. Wade put power back in the hands of states to determine abortion access.\n\nSince the start of 2023, nearly 700 abortion bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the country, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive rights organization.\n\nThis year has seen 25 measures enacted restricting abortion access and 30 protecting and expanding abortion access, according to Guttmacher.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade in landmark case on abortion rights\n\nThe justices ruled that it is up to the states to decide abortion access.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion that has been the law nationwide for almost 50 years.\n\nThe court ruled 5-4, in an opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, who called Roe \"egregiously wrong from the start.\"\n\nAt the same time, the court voted 6-3 to uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks, with very few medical exceptions.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts joined the judgment in the case -- siding with Mississippi and upholding its ban.\n\nBut Roberts said the case could be decided for Mississippi by going no further.\n\n\"None of this, however, requires that we also take the dramatic step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in Roe. Mississippi itself previously argued as much to this Court in this litigation,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nThe court also overturned Casey v. Planned Parenthood, another landmark decision involving legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nAlito also wrote the bombshell draft opinion that would have overturned Roe and was leaked to the public earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday's ruling, Alito wrote that the Constitution \"does not confer a right to abortion,\" stating it is ultimately up to the states to regulate abortion access.\n\n\"Abortion presents a profound moral question,\" Alito wrote. \"The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. The Court overrules those decisions and returns that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely-the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" and \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The right to abortion does not fall within this category,\" he wrote.\n\nThe three liberal justices dissented to Friday's ruling.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan lamented that millions of American women will lose a fundamental right because of the court's decision.\n\n\"It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of,\" their dissent reads. \"A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law.\"\n\nThe three justices also pushed back on the majority's reasoning that each state can address abortion access as it pleases.\n\n\"That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor woman who cannot get the money to fly to a distant State for a procedure,\" they wrote. \"Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today's decision.\"\n\nAlito used the same language as in the leaked draft to say that other unenumerated rights -- those not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution -- are not immediately in doubt.\n\n\"To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nBut the rationale put forth in his Dobbs opinion would seem to open the door to new litigation that could revisit settled precedent on contraception, and same-sex relationships and marriage.\n\nIn fact, Justice Clarence Thomas in his concurrence explicitly calls on the court to reconsider them.\n\n\"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is \"demonstrably erroneous,\" we have a duty to \"correct the error\" established in those precedents,\" he wrote.\n\n\"After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Court's substantive due process cases are \"privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nSince Roe v. Wade in 1973 and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, the court has forbidden states from banning abortions prior to fetal viability outside the womb, roughly 24 weeks, according to medical experts.\n\nMississippi had argued that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that each state should be allowed to set its own policy.\n\nJackson Women's Health, the state's only remaining abortion clinic, argued that the high court's protection of a woman's right to choose abortion is clear, well-established precedent and should be respected.\n\nAfter oral arguments in December, a majority of justices voted initially to side with Mississippi, according to a leaked first draft opinion by Justice Alito published by Politico in early May and confirmed to be authentic by Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nMajorities of Americans have long supported upholding Roe v. Wade and oppose state bans on all abortions, according to ABC News/Washington Post polling.\n\nBut Americans appear more divided on the type of ban at issue in Mississippi. A Marquette University Law School poll late last year found 37% favored upholding a 15-week ban, with 32% opposed.\n\nMississippi's sole clinic only performs abortions up to 16 weeks.\n\nAs the Supreme Court case was pending, several Republican-led states enacted unique laws that effectively circumvent constitutional protections for abortion.\n\nTexas' SB8 - a near-total ban on abortions -- took force in September, deputizing everyday citizens to sue anyone who \"aids or abets\" an illegal abortion. Oklahoma recently implemented a similar citizen-enforced measure that bans all abortions, with only exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that it could not intervene to block the state laws.\n\nTwenty-six states are considered certain or likely to ban abortions following the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Fourteen states plus Washington, D.C., have laws explicitly protecting access to abortion care.\n\nThe ruling is the court's most significant on abortion rights in years and the first for the current conservative majority with Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n\"Today marks an historic human rights victory for unborn children and their mothers and a bright pro-life future for our nation,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, in a statement.\n\n\"Every legislature in the land, in every single state and Congress, is now free to allow the will of the people to make its way into the law through our elected representatives,\" Dannenfelser added.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference that congressional Republicans are \"plotting a nationwide abortion ban.\"\n\n\"This morning, the radical Supreme Court is eviscerating Americans' rights and endangering their health and safety, but the Congress will continue to act to overcome this extremism and protect the American people. Today. the Republican controlled supreme court has achieved their dark extreme goal of ripping away a woman's right to make their own reproductive health decisions,\" she said.\n\n\"Be aware of this, the Republicans are plotting a nationwide abortion ban. They cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress to do that,\" she said.\n\nAbout the same time, in a press conference celebrating the Supreme Court ruling, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Republicans would put anti-abortion legislation on the floor next year if they retake the chamber.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "6 months after overturning of Roe v. Wade, what abortion access looks like in America\n\nWhere and how people get abortion care has changed dramatically across the U.S.\n\nThe abortion landscape of the United States has changed dramatically since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court six months ago.\n\nThe decision to reverse Roe, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion care, means states now choose how much access residents have to abortion.\n\nSome states either had so-called trigger laws go into effect or laws that pre-dated Roe that were enforced following the court's decision.\n\nMeanwhile, some other states enacted laws that strengthened abortion rights or rejected ballot initiatives that would have further restricted access to the procedure. And then there were states did neither.\n\n\"Both those legal changes happened, and we went to this patchwork,\" Katie Watson , an associate professor of medical social sciences, medical education, and obstetrics & gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told ABC News. \"And states took different positions and it's still in flux six months later.\"\n\nSince Roe was overturned, at least 14 states have nearly ceased all abortion services .\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute , Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia have completely banned abortion with limited exceptions.\n\nAdditionally, in Wisconsin, abortion services have stopped \"due to legal uncertainty around the status of the state's pre-Roe ban,\" the Guttmacher Institute states.\n\nWisconsin has a 20-week ban but also a pre-Roe abortion ban on the books that could go into effect now that Roe has been overturned. Georgia also has a six-week ban in place.\n\nAdditionally, Florida has a 15-week ban in effect. Arizona also has a 15-week ban, but it won't be enforced until 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, in Indiana, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah and Wyoming, abortion bans were passed, but are currently being blocked while legal action proceeds.\n\nWhile many states enacted abortion restrictions following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, multiple states adopted protections for and committed funding to abortion access.\n\nStates including California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Oregon committed over $250 million collectively to abortion funding over the past year, according to Guttmacher.\n\nOther efforts to protect abortion access included new laws to improve abortion access in four states -- Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York -- to increase security for providers and patients accessing abortion care.\n\nAccording to Guttmacher, 14 states adopted so-called shield laws designed to shield people who travel across states lines to receive an abortion and the providers who care for those patients. This means they can't be charged for receiving an abortion out-of-state.\n\nThe fall of Roe v. Wade raised the stakes for the 2022 midterm election in November, as multiple states had abortion-related questions on the ballot.\n\nKansas voters decisively rejected a bid to remove abortion protections from its state constitution.\n\nThe vote came after the state's Supreme Court decided in 2019 that the Kansas constitution establishes a fundamental right to abortion.\n\nThe Kansas vote was the first state-level test after the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade .\n\nIn California, voters decided to amend the state constitution to prohibit the state from denying or interfering with a person's \"reproductive freedom.\" Voters also accepted lawmakers' proposal to protect the fundamental right to choose to get an abortion or use contraceptives.\n\nCurrently, abortion is legal up until viability in California, which is about 24 to 26 weeks gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nIn Vermont, voters approved amending the state's constitution to include a right to \"personal reproductive autonomy,\" which includes abortion. Although it is currently legal in Vermont at any stage of pregnancy, the state's constitution did not grant explicit protections for the right to abortion prior to the acceptance of the amendment.\n\nMichigan voters meanwhile approved a constitutional amendment that would add protections for reproductive rights. The amendment defines reproductive freedom as \"the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management and infertility care.\"\n\nA state abortion ban on the books in Michigan since 1931 is being challenged in state courts, but a state judge ruled in September that the ban is unconstitutional, barring its enforcement by the state's attorney general and state prosecutors.\n\nIn Kentucky, voters rejected an amendment to the state's constitution that specified the right to abortion does not exist, nor is the government required to allocate funding for abortion.\n\nAbortion is currently banned in the state after a trigger law went into effect when Roe was overturned. Arguments against the ban will soon be heard in the Kentucky Supreme Court, something the amendment would have prevented.\n\nMontana voters rejected a proposal to change the state constitution to define all fetuses \"born alive\" as legal persons, including those born after an attempted abortion. The proposal would have granted any fetus born alive the right to appropriate and reasonable medical care and treatment.\n\nMontana state courts have blocked three abortion bans passed last year from going into effect while litigation continues.\n\nDr. Beverly Gray , an obstetrician and gynecologist at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina, told ABC News that ever since Roe was overturned, there has been an increase in patients, both locally and from out-of-state.\n\n\"With Florida having a 15-week ban, Georgia and Tennessee having fairly strict bans, and then South Carolina kind of going back and forth with bans, patients ended up coming to North Carolina for care,\" she said. \"We're seeing a handful of patients almost every day in clinic that are traveling for care.\"\n\n\"I think it's really scary for patients who might find themselves in a situation that they weren't expecting and needing care and their providers may not be able to provide evidence-based care because of laws that are now in place,\" she continued.\n\nGray said she has seen a \"sustained increase\" in the number of patients seeking abortions in North Carolina after the Supreme Court decision, and that a significant number of them have come from neighboring states with strict abortion restrictions.\n\n\"When South Carolina had their strict ban in place, there were like six or seven weeks this summer we had a fairly high volume and then when Georgia law went into effect,\" she said.\n\nHaving this increase can be logistically challenging, Gray said. North Carolina has a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed and providers are required to read a mandatory counseling script from the state, which includes information about public and private services available during pregnancy and possible adverse effects of abortion and pregnancy.\n\nCritics say the script is a fear tactic to shame and scare people out of having abortions.\n\n\"So, there's a lot of ... logistics and requirements that have to be in place before people can get here, so it requires a lot of coordination,\" Gray said. \"We have someone who pretty much deals with ... phone calls and logistics most day, every day that we're in clinic.\"\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's decision, several abortion clinics were forced to either shut down or move their practices out of state.\n\nThe Red River Women's Clinic moved from Fargo, North Dakota, to Moorhead, Minnesota -- a mile-and-a-half away -- after Roe's overturn due to the legal battles currently being waged in North Dakota, although abortion is still legal in the state.\n\nSince opening on Aug.10, Tammi Kromenaker, director of RRWC, told ABC News it was bittersweet to move but they've found a rhythm.\n\n\"We're providing care to patients in North Dakota, South Dakota, northwestern Minnesota; we have had a couple of gals from Texas come, like two,\" she said. \"We're still able to see people in a very short amount of time, I feel like we've just like hit -- I don't want to call it 'normal' -- but we're back to seeing patients that we used to see in Fargo.\"\n\nShe said the difference in political climate between North Dakota and Minnesota offers more freedom with abortion care.\n\n\"It's so indescribable that we can just make an appointment with a person without having to go through telling them very stigmatizing awful language that the state made us used to say in North Dakota,\" Kromenaker said. \"Literally just being five minutes away, it's the same community, but it's such a stark contrast between the two states.\"\n\nAlthough Kromenaker and her colleagues are currently fighting legal battles in the state to prevent abortion bans from going into effect, she said she's not sure if the clinic would ever move back or if she would open a second clinic in the Peace Garden State.\n\n\"There are so many onerous restrictions on providers in North Dakota, that unless or until those are taken away -- I mean, we had to tell patients 24 hours ahead of time, 'Abortion terminates the life of a whole separate unique living human being.' We had to force materials from the state on women, they couldn't refuse it, they had to receive it. We were restricted in our medication abortion regimen,\" she explained.\n\n\"I need to see those ... things go away before we would think about going back and providing care there. And I just don't see, with the way North Dakota is right now, that happening for quite some time,\" she added.\n\nABC News' Nadine El-Bawab and Alexandra Svokos contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What would have been 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade sees protests, celebration\n\nNearly 14 states have ceased nearly all abortion services.\n\nFor the first time in five decades, the anniversary of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade is being marked in a post-Roe world .\n\nOn Sunday -- the 50th anniversary of the court's milestone ruling making abortion a protected, constitutional right -- marches are taking place across the country amid uncertainty about the current state of reproductive rights.\n\nIn the nearly seven months since the Supreme Court's ruling last June overturning Roe v. Wade in a decision known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, at least 14 states have ceased nearly all abortion care.\n\nOn Friday, anti-abortion protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., for March for Life, an annual event that this year carried the theme, \"Next Steps: Marching in a Post-Roe America.\"\n\nIn cities across the country Sunday, protestors in support of abortion rights are taking to the streets to promote their version of what a \"post-Roe America,\" should look like one in which abortion access is protected.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will spend the 50th anniversary of Roe delivering remarks in Florida, a state that now has a 15-week abortion ban without exceptions for rape, incest or human trafficking.\n\n\"It cannot be understated the profound individual, societal, public health impact of what Roe v. Wade stood for,\" Dr. Deborah Bartz, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told ABC News. \"It was the federal law of the land for 49-and-a-half years. That's an exceedingly long time. The Dobbs decision was a sad situation that allowed states to now dictate for their citizen to what extent full, reproductive health options are available to them.\"\n\nShe added, \"I hope that Sunday is a day of celebration, that we can reclaim it. I want it to be a day that I commemorate as an abortion provider all the amazing people that advocated ahead of the decision of Roe and who worked within abortion services during Roe, post-Roe and continue to work here.\"\n\nIn 1969, Norma McCorvey was a 22-year-old woman living in Texas when she became pregnant for the third time. Single and unemployed at the time, McCorvey wanted to have an abortion.\n\nAt that time in the U.S., the legality of abortion was based on state's decisions, and in Texas, where McCorvey lived, it was illegal.\n\nIn trying to access abortion care, McCorvey was referred to two lawyers, Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, who took on her case.\n\nMcCorvey went on to become the plaintiff, going by the pseudonym \"Jane Roe,\" in the Supreme Court case that made abortion a federally protected right.\n\nIn the case, seven of the court's nine justices ruled that the 9th and 14th amendments to the Constitution protect an individual's right to privacy.\n\nThe justices, all men, decided the amendments are \"broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.\"\n\nBy the time the court ruled on her case in 1973, McCorvey, unable to access an abortion, had given birth to a daughter and given her up for adoption.\n\nMcCorvey went public with her role in the Roe v. Wade case in the 1980s, becoming an abortion rights activist.\n\nShe later switched her position and publicly opposed abortion rights. In 1997, McCorvey formed her own group, Roe No More Ministry, and spoke out against abortion.\n\nTwo decades later, in 2017, McCorvey died at the age of 69.\n\nMcCorvey was remembered after her death as opposed to abortion rights -- until the documentary \"AKA Jane Roe\" was released in 2020. The documentary included a late-life interview with McCorvey where she said she wasn't actually against abortion.\n\nShe claimed she had been paid by the anti-abortion movement to say she was.\n\nFive years after McCorvey's death, in 2021, the daughter she gave up for adoption, a woman named Shelley Lynn Thornton, broke her silence. Prior to that, for more than 50 years, Thornton's identity had been unknown to the public.\n\nThornton told ABC News' Linsey Davis she never agreed to meet her biological mother in person and has \"no regrets\" about that, in part because of comments McCorvey had made to the press about alternating between feeling guilty for placing her for adoption and wishing she'd gotten the abortion.\n\n\"She didn't deserve to meet me,\" Thornton said. \"She never did anything in her life to get that privilege back. She never expressed genuine feeling for me or genuine remorse for doing the things that she did, saying the things that she did over and over and over again. She wasn't sorry, about giving me away or anything.\"\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe, Thornton issued a statement to ABC News , slamming the reversal.\n\n\"Too many times has a woman's choice, voice and individual freedom been decided for her by others. Being that I am bound to the center of Roe v. Wade, I have a unique perspective on this matter specifically,\" Thornton said in a statement via her spokesperson, Raúl Rojas.\n\n\"I believe that the decision to have an abortion is a private, medical choice that should be between a woman, her family, and her doctor. We have lived in times of uncertainty and insecurity before, but to have such a fundamental right taken away and this ruling be overturned concerns me of what lies ahead.\"\n\nSince the Supreme Court's decision, at least 14 states have nearly ceased all abortion services .\n\nAlabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia have passed abortion bans with limited exceptions, according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nAdditionally, Georgia has a six-week ban in place and abortion services are not being provided In Wisconsin due to confusion over whether an 1849 law that bans abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, is in effect.\n\nWhat's more, Florida and Arizona each have 15-week bans in effect as well.\n\nAbortion bans were passed in Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming, but have either been blocked due to court proceeding or were overturned by higher courts.\n\nThe annual March for Life rally was held in Washington, D.C. for the first time on Friday in a post-Roe world. While anti-abortion protesters have celebrated the Supreme Court's decision, they've also bemoaned that abortion is still being practiced in many states.\n\n\"While this year marks our most significant victory, the human rights abuse of abortion is far from over,\" Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, said during a speech . \"We will continue to march until the human rights abuse of abortion is a thing of the past. We will march until abortion is unthinkable.\"\n\nOn the flip side, leaders in several states have strengthened and protected access to abortion.\n\n\"Roe v. Wade, the case, has been overturned, but Roe is not dead,\" Katie Watson, an associate professor of medical education, medical social sciences and obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, told ABC News. \"Roe is something larger than the case. It's also a cultural phenomena that shaped the lives of all American women for 49 years. It's also not dead in the sense that its principles have been carried forward in state legislation and in state constitutional analyses.\"\n\nGovernors in Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Washington signed executive orders expanding access to abortion, protecting people who seek or provide abortions from criminal or civil investigations or charges and prohibiting state agencies from cooperating in investigations.\n\n\"A woman's right to choose is just that -- a woman's, not a politician's,\" Maine Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement .\n\nIn Delaware, Gov. John Carney signed legislation expanding who can perform an abortion, including licensed physician assistants, certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse-midwives with training to \"terminate pregnancy before viability.\"\n\nAdditionally, Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado , then-Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts , Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan , Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said they will not extradite women who sought abortions or providers who performed the procedure in their respective states.\n\nBaker's and Lujan Grisham's orders also protect providers from losing their licenses or being subject to discipline due to out-of-state charges relating to abortion.\n\nIn Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee signed a directive forbidding the Washington State Patrol from cooperating with investigations related to abortion in states with restricted access.\n\nIn September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed bills that prohibit medical information regarding abortion from being released in response to a subpoena or a request from out of state.\n\nAdditionally, law enforcement and corporations are prohibited from cooperating with an an out-of-state inquiry into an abortion performed in California and cannot arrest someone from aiding an abortion performed in California.\n\nEarlier this month, Illinois lawmakers passed a bill shielding abortion and providers from legal action in states where the procedure is legal, according to ABC 7 Chicago , and signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nA report from the Society of Family Planning shows that the number of abortions did decrease in the U.S. overall post-Dobbs, but increased in states without restrictions.\n\n\"American women aren't standing still for this. They are not surrendering to this brutal hostage taking effort of their state governments to say, we're going to force you to create another human being against your will,\" Watson said. \"They're literally moving. They're literally getting out of Dodge, and seeking those abortions.\"\n\nOn the federal level, in August, President Joe Biden signed an executive order , directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"consider actions\" to help protect access to abortion, to \"consider all appropriate actions\" for doctors who are unsure if they are violating state laws when providing care and to \"evaluate the adequacy\" of collecting abortion data.\n\nThe order does not overrule state laws, nor does it expand abortion access, but it does require members of the Biden administration to further study the matter.\n\nAbortion was on the ballot in five states during the midterm elections in 2022 with voters enshrining abortion rights in their state constitutions in three states and against further restricting access to abortion services in two states.\n\nVoters decided to amend their state constitutions in California and Vermont and added a constitutional amendment in Michigan that grants explicit protections for reproductive rights.\n\nAlthough abortion is banned in Kentucky, voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have specified the right to abortion does not exist, nor is the government required to allocate funding for abortion.\n\nIn Montana, voters turned down a proposal that would have amended the state constitution to define all fetuses \"born alive\" as legal persons, including those born after an abortion.\n\nThe proposal would have granted any fetus born alive the right to appropriate and reasonable medical care and treatment. Providers who do not give that care would have faced a fine of up to $50,000 and up to 20 years in prison.\n\nABC News' Nadine El-Bawab, Kyla Guilfoil and Alexandra Svokos contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Where abortion stands in each state a year since the overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nA total of 15 states have ceased nearly all abortion services.\n\nSaturday marks one year since the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling overturning Roe v. Wade , the 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion.\n\nAs a result, the landscape of abortion access has shifted dramatically over the past year, with the decision of access left up to each state.\n\nSome states had trigger laws banning abortion that went into effect once the decision came down from the Court. Others guaranteed the right to an abortion in their state laws or constitutions.\n\nOne year post-Roe, here is where abortion laws stand in each state , according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that focuses on sexual and reproductive health, and further reporting.\n\nAlabama\n\nAlabama is one of the 15 states that has ceased nearly all abortion services, in this case under a so-called \"trigger law\" that went into effect immediately after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nThe state constitution also \"explicitly excludes abortion rights,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nAlaska\n\nThe right to an abortion remains protected by state law and constitution. Abortion in Alaska is legal at all stages of pregnancy, as long as it is performed by a licensed physician, according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nArizona\n\nAbortion is banned at 15 weeks and later following a judge's ruling last September that upheld a century-old ban on abortion. The 1901 law , which has language that can be tracked back to 1864, provides no exceptions for rape, incest or fetal abnormalities and makes performing abortions punishable by two to five years in prison.\n\nThe only exception is if the mother's life is in danger.\n\nArkansas\n\nAbortion is nearly completely banned in Arkansas due to a trigger law that went into effect following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Arkansas Human Life Protection Act, or Act 180, makes performing or attempting to perform an abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.\n\nThe only exception is if the mother's life is in danger.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe right to abortion is protected by updated state laws .\n\nColorado\n\nThe right to abortion is protected by updated state laws .\n\nConnecticut\n\nAbortion is allowed up until a fetus becomes \"viable,\" which is typically around 24 week to 26 weeks. The state, \"has a shield law to protect abortion providers from investigations by other states,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nDelaware\n\nLike in Connecticut, abortion is allowed up to the point of fetal viability in Delaware. The state also has a so-called shield law to protect abortion providers.\n\nFlorida\n\nAbortion is banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis signed a six-week ban into law in April 2023 , but it will not go into effect until 30 days after the state's Supreme Court rules on a case that challenges the current 15-week ban.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAbortion is banned at six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nHawaii\n\nAbortion is allowed up to the point of fetal viability, and Hawaii also has a so-called shield law to protect abortion providers.\n\nIdaho\n\nAbortion is nearly completely banned. The state, \"requires an 'affirmative defense,' meaning a provider has to prove in court that an abortion met the criteria for a legal exception,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nIllinois\n\nAbortion is allowed up to the point of fetal viability, and abortions can be performed by \"qualified health care physicians,\" not just solely physicians.\n\nIn January 2023, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed comprehensive reproductive health care legislation into law that protects out-of-state abortion seekers and allows them to get an abortion.\n\nIndiana\n\nAbortion is allowed up to 22 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nLast year, state lawmakers passed a near-total ban on abortion, but for now the procedure remains legal while the law is challenged in court .\n\nIowa\n\nAbortion is allowed up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nEarlier this month, the Iowa Supreme Court prevented a six-week abortion ban that was signed into law several years ago from going into effect. The court was split in a 3-3 decision on the case, meaning abortion remains legal in the state.\n\nKansas\n\nAbortion is allowed up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nLast November, Kansas voters decisively rejected a bid to remove abortion protections from its state constitution.\n\nKentucky\n\nAbortion is nearly completely banned . The only exception is if the mother's life is in danger.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAbortion is banned with very limited exceptions. The state had several trigger laws that went into effect immediately after Roe was overturned.\n\nMaine\n\nAbortion is currently allowed until a fetus becomes viable.\n\nUnder a proposal put forward this year by Gov. Janet Mills, the law could change to allow abortion after fetal viability \"if it's deemed necessary by a physician,\" according to The Associated Press .\n\nMaryland\n\nAbortion is allowed up to the point of fetal viability.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAbortion is allowed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nMichigan\n\nAbortion is protected in the state constitution and allowed up to the point of fetal viability.\n\nIn April, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill repealing the state's 1931 law that criminalized abortion.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAbortion is allowed up to the point of fetal viability.\n\nMississippi\n\nAbortion is banned, with very limited exceptions, in Mississippi, the state that was at the center of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn the case, Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the state asked the justices to overturn longstanding legal precedent that restrictions on abortion access before a fetus is viable outside the womb -- around 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy -- are categorically unconstitutional.\n\nMissouri\n\nAbortion is nearly completely banned. The state, \"requires an 'affirmative defense,' meaning a provider has to prove in court that an abortion met the criteria for a legal exception,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute .\n\nMontana\n\nAbortion is currently legal in Montana until fetal viability.\n\nIn May 2023, Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a bill banning abortion after 15 weeks.

      "text": "After Roe ruling, is 'stare decisis' dead? How the Supreme Court's view of precedent is evolving\n\nFriday's decision eliminates a constitutional right for first time.\n\nIn thousands of rulings over its storied history, the U.S. Supreme Court has broken with stare decisis, the doctrine of respecting prior decisions, just 145 times in cases requiring interpretation of the Constitution.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that extended constitutional protection for abortion, marks one of the few times it has clawed back a right enjoyed by millions of Americans for decades.\n\n\"The court has never ever overturned a prior case extending a constitutional right,\" said Cardozo Law professor Kate Shaw, an ABC News legal analyst. At the same time, other scholars say, it would be restoring the right of people to govern themselves through elected policymakers.\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health -- allowing states to ban abortion -- has put renewed focus on when and how the high court decides to reverse itself, and what some scholars say is a distinct shift in approach over the last 50 years.\n\n\"In most matters, it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right,\" wrote Justice Louis Brandeis in 1932, famously summarizing the court's approach to precedent at the time.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito made clear the current majority has a different view: \"When it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution,\" Alito wrote in Dobbs, \"we place a high value on having the matter 'settled right.'\"\n\nThe perceived \"rightness\" of a settled case has taken on new salience with the current Supreme Court, where five conservative justices -- three appointed in the last five years -- have signaled growing openness to revisit old \"wrongs.\"\n\n\"There is evidence that a weaker version of stare decisis -- the presumption that the Supreme Court generally should not overrule its prior decisions -- is in vogue on the court,\" wrote University of Akron Law School professor Michael Gentithes in a 2020 law review analysis.\n\nGentithes says the high-water mark for the power of stare decisis was in the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, when a conservative majority of justices reaffirmed the core holding of Roe even though a plurality considered it flawed.\n\n\"Then, as now, there were a bunch of new justices on the court who seemed quite skeptical of the soundness of Roe,\" said Shaw. \"And many people were very surprised to see the final outcome from a three justice majority of Republican appointees.\"\n\nSince then, as the court's membership has changed, \"poor reasoning\" in a prior decision has become \"ever-present justification\" to attempt to overturn it, Gentithes' analysis found.\n\nNotably, it was Justice Alito who enshrined the court's current approach to precedent in his 2018 opinion Janus v. AFSCME.\n\nLaying out five factors he says justices should weigh in reversing a precedent, Alito put the quality of its reasoning as the paramount consideration -- a standard that several of his justice peers have publicly embraced.\n\n\"I think a lot of people lack courage. They know what is right, and they're scared to death of doing it. And then they come up with all these excuses for not doing it,\" Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined Alito's opinion in Janus, said last month about overturning cases he believes to be fundamentally wrong.\n\nTwo years later, Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a concurring opinion in Ramos v. Louisiana, put his spin on the approach, saying the precedent must be \"grievously or egregiously\" wrong to warrant overturning. But even then, he noted, justices should keep an eye on the reliance interests in a prior decision and a need to \"maintain stability in the law.\"\n\nJustices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett all voted to overturn Roe and Casey.\n\n\"When one of our constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake,\" Alito explained.\n\nError correction has always been a factor in the Supreme Court's rationale for overturning precedent, especially in matters of constitutional interpretation, which cannot easily be addressed by Congress.\n\nWhile lawmakers could have attempted to amend the constitution to obliterate the Supreme Court's racist \"separate but equal\" doctrine legitimized in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision, it was the justices' unanimous 1954 ruling to overturn Plessy in Brown v. Board of Education that set it right.\n\n\"I think the Plessy example is very persuasive, not that Roe should be overturned but that we don't want a stare decisis doctrine written in stone -- or even setting cement,\" said Sarah Isgur, a former Justice Department lawyer and ABC News legal analyst.\n\nJustice Brandeis, a revered liberal icon of the court, acknowledged as much in his 1932 writing on stare decisis, noting that \"lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning\" may necessitate corrections.\n\nBut critics say contemporary emphasis on a prior decision's reasoning -- and its rightness or wrongness -- may be undermining stare decisis and the credibility of the court.\n\n\"A court that changes its mind every time there is a new justice or different set of facts undermines the very concept of the rule of law and creates uncertainty for citizens, businesses and elected officials trying to go about their lives while following the laws of the land,\" said Isgur.\n\nMany legal scholars say overturning Roe also threatens precedents involving rights other than abortion not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, such as marriage.\n\n\"If the court is willing to overrule Roe v. Wade, after we just had confirmation hearings of justices come in and say it's precedent upon precedent, it's a 'super precedent,' it's foundational,\" said Rachel Barkow, vice-dean of New York University Law School, \"what the public sees is that no precedent is safe, that stare decisis is meaningless to them and that anything is up for grabs.\"\n\nAlito attempts to head off the criticism in his decision, writing \"nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\n\"Everybody thinks that stare decisis is the idea that precedent counts for something, but it's not absolute,\" said University of Notre Dame law professor Sherif Girgis, a former clerk to Justice Alito. \"It gets respect because it's a precedent, but there's always the possibility that it can be overturned if a bunch of other criteria are satisfied.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "House passes bills to codify Roe, protect interstate travel for abortion\n\nDemocrats are ramping up their messaging on abortion ahead of the midterms.\n\nThe House of Representatives on Friday passed two measures to restore abortion rights after the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe action comes as Democrats ramp up their political messaging on abortion ahead of the November midterm elections, hoping the issue will drive voters to the ballot box to preserve the party's majorities in Congress.\n\n\"It's outrageous that 50 years later, women must again fight for our most basic rights against an extremist court and Republican Party,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Friday in a press conference on the U.S. Capitol steps ahead of the vote.\n\n\"Democrats are honoring the basic truth: women's most intimate health decisions are her own,\" Pelosi added.\n\nThe first bill, titled the Women's Health Protection Act, would establish a statutory right for health care providers to provide, and patients to receive, abortion services. It would also prohibit states from imposing restrictions on abortion care.\n\nThe measure passed in a 219-to-210 vote. No Republicans voted in favor of the bill.\n\nThe Women's Health Protection Act now goes to the Senate, where it previously failed to move forward after the House first passed it in September 2021.\n\nAny abortion-related legislation will likely meet a similar fate in the upper chamber, where Democrats need 10 Republican votes to overcome the 60-vote filibuster.\n\n\"We must ensure that the American people remember in November, because with two more Democratic senators, we will be able to eliminate the filibuster when it comes to a woman's right to choose and to make reproductive freedom the law of the land,\" Pelosi said Friday.\n\nThe second bill to pass the House, known as the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, addresses recent efforts by state legislatures to punish Americans traveling for reproductive health care. The bill would would ensure no person acting under state law could prevent, restrict, or otherwise retaliate against a person traveling across state lines for lawful abortion services.\n\nThe measure passed 223 to 205.\n\nSenate Republicans on Thursday blocked a bill that would have both legally shielded the people who travel across states lines to receive an abortion and the providers who care for those patients.\n\nAt least 13 states have ceased nearly all abortion services after the high court's June 24 decision ending Roe, and several Republican-controlled states are already considering legislation to bar women from seeking services out-of-state.\n\n\"Are we going to allow these lawmakers to hold American citizens hostage in their own states, forcing them to give birth?\" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in a floor speech on Thursday. \"Does that sound like the America that we know? No it doesn't, and we need to draw the line here and now.\"\n\nJust last week, hundreds of abortion rights activists protested outside the White House calling on President Joe Biden to do more to ensure abortion rights. Biden signed an executive order on July 8 aimed at protecting access, but said it's ultimately up to Congress to codify Roe.\n\nBiden's message to the demonstrators was to \"keep protesting.\"\n\n\"Keep making your point. It's critically important,\" he said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Majority of OB-GYNs believe overturning Roe led to more maternal deaths: Survey\n\nSeventy percent of OB-GYNs said it's worsened racial and ethnic inequities.\n\nA majority of OB-GYNs say the overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer is linked to more maternal deaths, according to a new survey released early Wednesday from KFF.\n\nThe decision -- known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization -- determined there is no constitutional right to an abortion and gave individual states full power to regulate abortion.\n\nSince then, at least 15 states have ceased nearly all abortion services, according to an ABC News tally.\n\nTo understand how the abortion landscape has changed, between mid-March and mid-May of this year, KFF surveyed nearly 570 OB-GYNs who spend the majority of their working hours in direct patient care.\n\nResults showed 64% of all OB-GYNs surveyed believe the ruling has worsened pregnancy mortality. Seventy percent said it's worsened racial and ethnic inequities and 56% believe it's worsened the ability to attract new doctors to the field.\n\nAdditionally, 55% of OB-GYNs practicing where abortion is banned say their ability to practice within the standard of care has become worse.\n\nHalf of OB-GYNs in states where abortion is banned said their patients were unable to obtain an abortion compared to about 25% of OB-GYNs across the nation.\n\nThe decision has also impacted miscarriage care. Four in 10 OB-GYNs in restricted states said they have faced constraints caring for patients experiencing miscarriages and other pregnancy-related emergencies. Meanwhile one in five across the U.S. reported the same.\n\nThe survey also asked whether OB-GYNs have seen an increase in patients asking for contraceptives.\n\nOnly a little more than 20% of OB-GYNs reported a rise in patients seeking either emergency contraceptive pills or measures including birth control pills, patches, rings and injections.\n\nComparatively, there was a much larger increase in patients requesting long-term and permanent form of contraception. About 47% of OB-GYNs saw an increase in patients wanting IUDs and 43% saw an increasing in wanting sterilization.\n\nThere is also a difference in how many OB-GYNs provide emergency contraception methods. In states where abortion is banned, 73% of OB-GYNS provide evonorgestrel/Plan versus 90% of OB-GYNs in states where abortion is available under most circumstances.\n\nWhat's more, 25% of OB-GYNs in states with abortion bans provide ulipristal acetate/Ella for emergency contraception and 40% provide copper IUDs for emergency contraception. These numbers are lower than in states where abortion is legal.\n\n\"This means that in abortion ban states, not only is abortion unavailable, but there is also limited OB-GYN provision of certain emergency contraception methods,\" the report reads.\n\nMeanwhile, providers are also worried about their own legal risk. More than four in 10 -- 42% -- of OB-GYNs report being \"very or somewhat concerned about their own legal risk when making decisions about patient care and the necessity of abortion.\"\n\nThe figure rises to 59% of OB-GYNs practicing in states with gestational limits and 61% in states that have abortion bans.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What are the potential risks to fertility and reproductive care post-Roe v. Wade?\n\nAt least 11 states have fetal personhood laws that could impact IVF treatments.\n\nHealth care groups and advocates have long warned that the overturn of Roe v. Wade could pose wider threats to reproductive healthcare and that anti-abortion groups' attacks on reproductive freedoms would not stop at abortion care.\n\nThose warnings materialized earlier this year when in vitro fertilization care was suspended at three of Alabama's largest providers after a state Supreme Court decision put providers at risk of prosecution.\n\nNow, physicians and experts warn the same could happen in other states with fetal personhood laws.\n\nFurther moves by conservative groups and lawmakers have also signaled what other reproductive freedoms could be at risk.\n\nFetal personhood laws, which classify fetuses, embryos or fertilized eggs as \"people\" could significantly undermine IVF patients' ability to make decisions about their care, including what to do with frozen embryos, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\n\"In the IVF context, embryo personhood would be extremely harmful to patients and providers, who could be criminalized, for example, for discarding an embryo or for transferring an embryo that then does not implant,\" Karla Torres, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told ABC News in an interview.\n\nFertility specialists suspended care in Alabama after the state Supreme Court issued a decision saying embryos are children, raising concerns that IVF specialists could face wrongful death lawsuits over handling of embryos. One facility said they even suspended the transfer of embryos to facilities in other states amid the confusion caused by the decision.\n\nThe ruling from the court came as part of a lawsuit filed by couples whose embryos were destroyed after a patient wandered into a fertility clinic through an unsecured door, removing several embryos and dropping them to the floor. The couples whose embryos were destroyed filed a wrongful death suit that was thrown out by a lower court that ruled embryos are not people.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court then reversed the lower court decision and said frozen embryos are children. After facing intense backlash, lawmakers passed legislation that would protect IVF care in the state, allowing care to resume.\n\n\"The bill, though, did not address the central finding in the seat Supreme Court's ruling, which is that cryopreserved embryos constitute 'unborn children' under the state's Wrongful Death Act,\" Torres said.\n\nThere are currently 11 states with broad fetal personhood laws on the books which could impact IVF treatments, according to Pregnancy Justice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for pregnant people.\n\nAn additional five states define a person to include a fetus throughout their criminal code and two more states -- Alaska and Wyoming -- define an \"unborn child\" as a human \"at any stage of development,\" according to Pregnancy Justice.\n\n\"The legal question is: at what point should a citizen be protected? And where I take issue with the Alabama ruling, is that they utilize their religious beliefs that life begins at fertilization. And that crossed a line, which shouldn't be crossed due to the alleged separation of church and state, that they now are saying that life gets protected,\" Dr. Eve Feinberg, a physician and fertility specialist at Northwestern University in Illinois, told ABC News.\n\n\"It's very dangerous for the provision of safe fertility care and I think it's very dangerous from a litigation standpoint, in the numerous instances where pregnancies may end through no fault or embryos may stop growing through no fault,\" Feinberg said.\n\nLess than half of oocytes -- cells from ovaries -- retrieved in a single IVF cycle become an embryo that could become viable.\n\n\"[Most] of everything that you start with stops growing and developing in IVF and that's just in the laboratory,\" Feinberg said.\n\nBetween 20 to 50% of embryos implanted stop growing after they are implanted, Feinberg said.\n\nAfter patients are done with IVF, some choose to donate unused embryos left over from IVF to science. A key part of how the fertility field has advanced is research on human embryos, according to Feinberg.\n\nFertility patients who grow their families with the help of a gestational carrier, or surrogate, often do not live in the same state as the surrogate, but one fertility specialist told ABC News the overturn of Roe has changed how patients feel.\n\n\"We have had patients who have gestational carriers who live in Texas or other red states, and it really makes them question whether they feel comfortable having somebody in one of those states carry their child,\" Feinberg said.\n\n\"I've had a number of patients who have turned down really otherwise good candidates to be a gestational carrier because the GC lives in an unfavorable state,\" Feinberg said.\n\nIntended parents who turned down surrogates in other states are concerned about not wanting to continue a pregnancy with a fatal fetal anomaly incompatible with life or the surrogate facing potential obstetric complications, like their water breaking before the fetus is viable, Feinberg said.\n\n\"Intended parents just don't want to be in a situation where the medical care of the person carrying their pregnancy is compromised. Texas laws are putting women at risk of death period,\" Feinberg said.\n\nThe usage of surrogates has increased in recent years due to several factors, including high cancer survivorship, which may leave survivors unable to carry a pregnancy; the number of cesarean section deliveries having \"skyrocketed,\" bringing an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and hysterectomies; and women surviving conditions, like congenital heart defects that were corrected as babies, that leave them unable to carry their own pregnancies, Feinberg said.\n\nPatients, who are more commonly using surrogacy, never thought twice about what state a potential carrier lived in before Roe was overturned, Feinberg said.\n\n\"It's driving up the cost of surrogacy, it is further diminishing the pool of available surrogates, and ... women who sign up to be surrogates -- they may be risking their lives in ways that they never thought about previously,\" Feinberg said.\n\nIndiana lawmakers recently passed new legislation that would require hospitals to offer postpartum patients with long acting reversible contraceptives.\n\n\"The bill author ended up getting advice from [anti-abortion group] Right to Life that they should remove IUDs specifically from the bill because Right to Life considers IUDs to be abortifacients[, causing abortions]. So the bill was represented in its amended form to only specifically include subdermal implants,\" Dr. Carrie Rouse, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Indiana, told ABC News in an interview.\n\n\"It creates this two-tiered approach to contraception where implants are good and IUDs are bad IUDs cause abortion, which is absolutely not true, but it sets the precedent,\" Rouse said.\n\nAn IUD is birth control placed in the uterus while a contraceptive implant is placed in the arm.\n\nFeinberg pointed to strict laws that used to regulate IVF care in Italy -- mandating that only three eggs be fertilized in a single IVF cycle and that everything that is fertilized has to be transferred -- as a cautionary tale for lawmakers in the U.S.\n\n\"IVF success rates were very low and the multiple pregnancy rate particularly that triplet rate was very high -- unacceptably high,\" Feinberg said.\n\nThis led to very high risk pregnancies and many children being born premature or with congenital anomalies, Feinberg said.\n\n\"Ultimately, the government said, Okay, we're not going to interfere. And they, they lifted the bans on how IVF was mandated to be practiced. I think what's very scary, is we are now potentially moving towards that,\" Feinberg said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
