      "text": "KKK Doc Sparks Controversy at SXSW: Daryl Davis Clashes with BLM Activists in Film, During Q&A\n\nRace relations are fast becoming the major theme of this year's SXSW. On Saturday-the second day of the fest-controversy erupted when Ibtihaj Muhammad, who is on track to be the first U.S. Olympic athlete to wear a hijab, was asked to remove the headscarf in order to take her festival badge photo at the registration desk. To add insult to injury, they then issued her an ID bearing the name \"Tamir Muhammad.\" And on Sunday afternoon, sparks flew during a post-screening Q&A for the documentary Accidental Courtesy , a film chronicling African-American blues musician Daryl Davis's attempts to befriend members of the Ku Klux Klan in order to help them change their racist ways.\n\nDavis famously killed former Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly with kindness, convincing him to leave the KKK. He did the same with Bob White, a former Grand Dragon and ex-Baltimore police officer. In total, he claims to have disrobed around 25 Klansmen. During the documentary, he pays a visit to Baltimore where he sits down with a pair of Black Lives Matter Activists-Kwame Rose, a 21-year-old college dropout who famously called out Geraldo Rivera on national television, and Tariq Toure, a poet and writer. Both are influential community organizers and activists who played sizeable roles in their city's protests following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody.\n\nIn the film, the trio sat down at a Baltimore bar for a chat. Thing get heated when the two young men question why Davis has spent the past thirty years trying to get white people to overcome their racism instead of helping his own people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What does that do for people?\" Rose asks of Davis in the film. \"Infiltrating the Klan ain't freeing your people.\" He added, \"Befriending a white person who doesn't have to go through the struggles of you, me... that's not an accomplishment. That's a new friend. That's somebody you can call.\"\n\n\"And this is coming from a dropout,\" Davis shoots back, condescendingly.\n\n\"You don't tell Steve Jobs he ain't successful. He don't have no college degree. Bill Gates ain't got no college degree,\" Rose replies.   \"Neither does Monica Lewinsky,\" says Davis.   \"OK, shit, and what?\" Rose says. \"She's giving blowjobs in the White House and doing whatever she was doing...\"   \"...Well, maybe you could give Obama a blowjob and make a lot of money, too,\" interrupts Davis.\n\nWith that, the two young men call Davis \"disrespectful\" and leave. At that point, Black Lives Matter community organizer JC Faulk enters, and berates Davis for the \"reprehensible\" way he treated the activists.\n\n\"Just like the young man said to you, you could have done a whole lot more work in the black community from the '90s to now to move our people forward rather than coming in here trying to uplift somebody because you got a hood off of their head,\" exclaims Faulk, adding, \"I don't give a shit about you, or your KKK hoods! Don't come to Baltimore doing this shit again. Don't come back here.\"\n\nDuring the post-screening Q&A session following the first showing of Accidental Courtesy at SXSW, things got testy. After an audience member questioned the BLM interaction in the film, Davis again took the opportunity to lay into Rose (who was not present) and defend the discourteous way he treated him on camera.\n\n\"As the man said, he's a 21-year-old dropout,\" Davis said of Rose.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether it's about race. There are many controversial topics out there-abortion, nuclear weapons, the 2 nd Amendment, guns, whatever, the war in Iraq,\" he continued. \"You're going to be on one side, somebody's going to be on the other side. Invite those people to the table. Sit down and talk. Because when two enemies are talking, they're not fighting. They may be yelling and screaming or pounding the table, but at least they're talking, they're not fighting.\"\n\nDavis then accused the Black Lives Matter activists-Rose, Toure, Faulk, and an unnamed party-of attempting to fight him (which is not shown in the film).\n\n\"It's when the talking ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence. You saw the violence almost erupt when the talking ceased,\" he said, referring to the BLM Baltimore sequence. \"We got a little loud, sure. The film did not show you that [the Black Lives Matter activists] came over to the table and it almost erupted in a fisticuffs. [Producer] Noah Ornstein here had to get in between us. Four of them wanted to beat me up. I didn't want to stand up because I didn't want to fight. And [Ornstein] prevented that.\"\n\nThen, the same audience member again challenged Davis on the way he treated the Black Lives Matter activists in the film, saying he sided with the members of BLM.\n\n\"They showed you respect, but you didn't show them respect,\" the man said. \"You showed the Klan members more respect than you showed those gentlemen there.\"\n\n\"You didn't see the entire thing,\" Davis replied. \"You only saw a snippet of what went on that day. I've dealt with a lot of black supremacists as well as white supremacists, and supremacy of any kind is wrong, and I address both black and I address both white. There's a difference between being ignorant and being stupid.... For me, an ignorant person is someone who makes the wrong decision or a bad choice because he or she does not have the proper facts.\"\n\n\"If you give that person the facts and the proper information you have alleviated that ignorance, and they make the right decision,\" he went on. \"A stupid person is someone who has the facts, who has the proper information, and still makes the wrong decision. The facts were not coming out of that guy's mouth. I presented the facts, some of which were presented in the film, some of which were not presented in the film.\"  The audience member continued to press Davis on the offensive and dismissive way he treated the Black Lives Matter activists in the film versus the polite and courteous way he treats Klan members while getting in their good graces, which prompted Davis to reply: \"When it was my turn to talk, who got up and walked away? It wasn't me.\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "What Ken Burns' Muhammad Ali Doc Misses About the Nation of Islam\n\nWatching Ken Burns' new four-part Muhammad Ali documentary stirred my recollections on what the three-time heavyweight champion and the Nation of Islam meant to youths growing up in East Elmhurst, a residential enclave for \"Black Muslims\" in Queens.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, East Elmhurst was home to an assortment of community leaders grappling with the dilemma of racial injustice. Among these were civil rights proponents like Bill Booth, a former judge and chairman of the New York City Human Rights Commission, and NOI figures like Malcolm X , Betty Shabazz and Louis Farrakhan .\n\nThe Burns film, Muhammad Ali , did a good job of chronicling the usual markers of Ali's life story but fell short in depicting why the NOI would appeal to ordinary Black youths at the time; instead, it spotlighted the group's \"separatist\" identity, the \"exotic\" faith and uniforms, the internal rivalries, and the intemperate statements of organization speakers.\n\nI imagine this is to be expected for a mainstream cultural creation that relies on footage from the national press. It's an approach that is prone to recycle old vantage points like the 1959 CBS documentary on Malcolm X and other \"Black supremacists,\" The Hate That Hate Produced . To us, though, the Muslims were little more than disaffected Baptists seeking alternative outlets.\n\nThe NOI was founded in Detroit in 1930 on the principles of freedom, justice, and equality for people of African descent. By the 1960s, when I became aware of the organization, it had grown to an estimated 70,000 members in the major cities thanks in part to the appeal of charismatic figures like Malcolm X, the national spokesman, and Muhammad Ali.\n\nWhat the documentary glosses over are the symbols of cultural pride and cooperative ventures that I recall as noteworthy to my peers. For example, the NOI members took steps to let us know that our lives mattered without the slogans and protest marches. It was common to see older men reach out to boys in the parks and on front steps to discuss history, current affairs, and personal goals. What did we want out of life? How do we conduct ourselves as young men? How will we contribute to the community and so forth?\n\nThey discussed respect for women and family and organized street games like sprints and stick ball. They formed neighborhood watch groups-and one time even retrieved a bicycle that had been stolen by a white passerby. Some narrated the lost history of African civilizations like ancient Sumer and Kush and the medieval empires of Ghana and the Moors. These were things we never heard about from teachers in primary school.\n\nMany of the NOI elders were of modest education. They sometimes got facts wrong or inflated historic achievements-but they tried within limitations to instill confidence in the next generation. Some of us made fun of them for wearing bowties, spouting mumbo-jumbo about the origins of white people, or carrying themselves with the strained dignity of men shunted aside by society. Others of us, though, quietly appreciated the attention of ordinary role models with all their flaws.\n\n\"Heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali (R) sits on the podium with Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad while attending the National Meeting of the Black Muslims. Ali drew a standing ovation when he addressed the crowd at the International Amphitheater in Chicago.\"\n\nMostly what they espoused were the teachings of the man born as Elijah Poole, a Georgia sharecropper who was an early member of the NOI and became its leader from the 1930s until his death in 1975. He changed his named to Elijah Muhammad and doled out a version of \"mother wit\" in \"Message to the Blackman in America.\" The Burns film showed Ali holding a copy of the 1973 work but neglected to explain either the message or its appeal to the ordinary person.\n\nWhat attracted us was not the message of Islam as much as the message of Black pride, self-improvement, and group cooperation. The NOI promoted survival strategies for marginal populations in the urban centers. It advocated common sense practices like living within your means, saving as much as possible, nurturing a supportive family life, spending your money among yourselves, supporting Black-owned businesses or businesses that hire your people, and seeking to improve health, education and community.\n\nSuch teachings gave us a blueprint to improve our chances in life. By contrast, the way of the civil rights programs required an over-reliance on factors outside of our control: protest marches, political coalitions, passage of laws, or begging white people to pay attention to our needs. While some of these things were necessary remedies, they relied so much on the positive responses of white institutions that it could foster a sense of dependency.\n\nThe NOI encouraged us to forge alliances across the sizable Black communities in the urban centers and across the Pan-African world. It was a model of communalism that offered a more affirming foundation than the strategy of unceasing rallies and marches-and the NOI practiced what it preached. In the 1960s, the organization instituted an economic program of cooperative development that included the purchase of farms, timberland, home construction, delivery trucks, and businesses owned by individual members and the organization.\n\nIn Chicago, for example, it opened 15 different businesses including a clothing factory, supermarket, meat packing company, bakery, restaurant, and barbershop. Across the country, it established grocery stores, dress shops, dry cleaners, bakeries, and restaurants that provided food, cooked meals, and clothing to the Black community at affordable prices. Moreover, it hired and trained people for jobs as managers, clerks, cooks, accountants, carpenters and the like.\n\nBasically, what Elijah Muhammad espoused were adaptations of the economic development program of Booker T. Washington and his National Negro Business League in 1900. Growing up in Georgia, Poole would have observed such initiatives at work in Atlanta and in the business districts of Black communities like Tulsa, Detroit, and Chicago.\n\nThe ideas were taken up in Harlem by the Pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914. Elijah Muhammad adapted the idea of cooperative ventures to the NOI, according to Claude Clegg in his 1997 biography, An Original Man . In addition, he witnessed the function of such programs during the Great Depression and of incarcerated Black men running prison services-if they could do it in the joint, he reasoned, why not in their own communities?\n\n\"Muhammad Ali enjoying a spontaneous encounter with his fans in Detroit, MI. Circa 1977.\"\n\nFinally, the film alluded to Ali being exploited by the NOI to finance mosques and other operations. As youths, we had no knowledge of such things, of course. However, the relationship to us seemed more on par with that of a wealthy benefactor to a favored church.\n\nTo return to 2021, the African American political class continues to grapple with the dire conditions of their people. For the most part, they have exhausted the prospects for meaningful change through protest-and can no longer stake a primary claim to the \"diversity\" jobs and programs in government, corporations, and institutions. For that reason, Black leaders should revisit the NOI strategy for economic development that inspired Muhammad Ali.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "searched_phrase": "black supremacists",

      "text": "What does Archie tell us about mixed-race Britain?\n\nThe new royal baby is part of the UK's fastest growing ethnic group.\n\nT he arrival of the new royal baby reminds us that not only are mixed-race people the UK's fastest-growing ethnic group; it also underlines that what it means to be mixed race is changing. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor will join the ranks of those second-generation mixed-race people who challenge our very perceptions of ethnicity and black identity.\n\nIn fact, the changing face of mixed-race Britain is something we barely notice even as we are looking directly at it. Perhaps that is the point. Back in the early 2000s we were vaguely aware that young celebrities, such as the late reality TV star Jade Goody or footballer Ryan Giggs, had a black grandparent. But they rarely discussed it or talked of how they perceived themselves.\n\nMost of us watch the actor Stephen Graham , or cheer footballers Ross Barkley and Kieran Trippier without registering their ethnicity. Did you just presume they were white? Before you congratulate yourself by saying, \"I don't think about race. It doesn't matter to me\", it is not that simple: maybe it matters to them. Their connection to a black identity, and whether others recognise it, might be something they feel is important .\n\nOur current view of mixed-race Britain, particularly in the context of the black (African/Caribbean) community, has become so familiar that it is now almost a cliche. I know it because I have lived it. When I was growing up in the 1970s and 80s, with a Jamaican mother and white English father, being mixed-race was not always easy, but it was relatively simple.\n\n\"White\" was an exclusive club to which someone like me did not belong. I was more likely to hear \"half-caste\" on the school playground than \"nigger\", and occasionally it was other black people, as well as white people, who made me feel like an outsider. But there seemed little doubt that society viewed me as black. I also learned I was black through positive experiences and a sense of belonging. In my mother's family, as with most Caribbeans, we go from dark skin and tight afro-hair to lighter skin and soft curls, with every variation in between. Whatever \"black\" was, I knew it was broad enough to include someone like me. I embraced it. It was not only how the world saw me, but how I wanted to be seen.\n\nBut alongside that \"first-generation\" experience of being black and mixed race, there is a new story that we have barely begun to discuss. What if my connection to my black heritage was not through a parent, but through a grandparent or great-grandparent? What if my physical appearance had not been different from my white classmates? Would I have experienced racism? Would I have felt included in being \"black\"? Would I have wanted to be? Should I have wanted to be?\n\nThousands of young people across the country are now grappling with those questions every day and their numbers are growing. The random shuffle of genes means that some will experience life in the same way as their mixed-race parent. Others will not, their African heritage revealed perhaps by their dark eyes or the curve of their nose, visible only to those who are looking. It is a feature of black heritage, ethnicity and identity we rarely hear about and it prompts wider questions: what will it mean to be mixed race or black in the UK in 2030, or 2050?\n\nOf course, black people in the UK have a long history of integrating and intermarrying into wider society. Furthermore, mixed-race people span all ethnic groups, not just those with black and white parents. But it is important to recognise that this phenomenon has a particular new significance to black Britain, for two key reasons.\n\nFirst, interracial relationships and the growing mixed-race population is something the British black community is experiencing in exceptionally higher numbers compared with other groups. According to the 2011 census, members of the black community are among the most likely to choose a white partner - close to 50% for black Caribbeans. (In contrast, those with heritage from the Indian subcontinent generally have a rate of interracial relationships that is much lower.) This likelihood also increases with each new generation: the chances of people of mixed black/white heritage having a white partner, are about 80%. The demographic implications of this for the future of black Caribbeans in Britain are obvious.\n\nDr Adam Elliott-Cooper, a research associate at the Department of Geography, King's College London, who is himself mixed-race, puts it succinctly: \"In the absence of significant new immigration, British Caribbean people, as we know them, are going to become largely absorbed into the wider white British community within a few generations. For the most part, their great-great-grandchildren are going to look very different from them.\"\n\nTrying to understand this phenomenon by drawing on the US black experience does not help, because this high rate of black interracial marriage is a very British phenomenon. African Americans in the US are among the least likely to have a partner outside their own ethnic group.\n\nSecond, although the integration of black people into a majority white community has happened before, it was in more brutal times. The idea of a \"one drop rule\", which meant that even those with distant African roots were \"unpure\" and would be treated as black, now seems farcical. Similarly, the days when many mixed-race people tried to \"pass\" for white and lived in fear of their \"dark secret\" being discovered feels ugly and archaic. That history provides little precedent for today's young people, who are unlikely to hide their heritage or define themselves based solely on race. If they are inclined to discuss the complexity of their heritage at all, it will be on their terms.\n\nIn this regard, the Liverpudlian actor Stephen Graham may be a trailblazer. It is beautifully ironic that the mixed-race grandson of a black Jamaican immigrant rose to fame playing a white, racist, skinhead in Shane Meadows's 2007 film, This is England . Graham talks comfortably about his pride in his grandfather's heritage and how it has shaped his identity. He also describes how he has challenged white racism when those around him thought they were safe to express unpleasant views about black people in front of him. The nuances and complexity of how someone such as Graham sees his black heritage in 21st-century Britain may now seem exceptional. They may soon be commonplace.\n\nA new understanding of what it is to be mixed-race in the UK means listening to voices that have often been missing. We frequently hear white liberals discussing interracial relationships in effusive terms, as if such relationships are, of themselves, the living embodiment of a happily integrated society. But it is worth remembering they do so in the context of less than 5% of white people being in interracial relationships.\n\nWe rarely hear from the black perspective. Even for those who feel overwhelmingly positive, a growing current of existential concern exists. For some black people, the increasing dominance of interracial relationships can feel like a devaluing of relationships between two black people. More pointedly, in a society where the stereotypical appearance of mixed-race people, with light brown skin and curly hair, is held up as the perfect symbol of Britain's exciting multicultural future, how does that make you feel if you are a dark-skinned black person with afro hair?\n\nA black perspective in these discussions is so important. The country has been fascinated by how it might feel to have the Queen's great-grandson recognised for his African-American heritage. Few have stopped to think about how the Duchess of Sussex , or her mother, Doria Ragland, would feel if he were not.\n\nPerhaps the least discussed aspect of second-generation mixed-race Britons is how it feels to be their mixed-race parent. In 2015, Miri Song and Caitlin O'Neill Gutierrez of the University of Kent, published a groundbreaking paper entitled \"Keeping the story alive: Is ethnic and racial dilution inevitable for multiracial people and their children?\" . It focused on 64 parents, most of whom were first-generation mixed-race people with a white partner, and discussed how they felt about the ethnic identity of their children. The findings were not what I expected.\n\nFour key themes emerged in the study: the loss in their children of \"cultural knowledge\" connected to their parents' ancestry; the \"embodiment of 'white-appearing children' and the effect of physical markers of minority heritage not being present in their children\"; a notion of \"reduced racial fractions\"; and concerns, among partially black participants in particular, about \"whitening\" and the loss of politicised racial consciousness.\n\nWhen I first read this, I was stunned. The participants seemed to be echoing some of the most unpleasant views I had heard as a child. \"Racial fractions\"? \"Whitening\"? It reminded me of being told by bigots that my parents had \"polluted\" my white heritage and \"diluted\" my black heritage.\n\nBut, as I continued reading, it became clear that those concerns were coming from a very different perspective than the racism I heard in my youth. The Kent University study is not a thesis against interracial relationships - far from it. It highlighted, perhaps for the first time, mixed-race people sharing feelings about their own children and identity that they also acknowledge sound irrational, unwelcome and self-contradictory.\n\nOne mixed-race participant, \"Abike\", reflected on her own son and his white partner, saying: \"I'm aware in the awful sort of way, almost like some horrible eugenicist, their children will be just kind of completely white. Which is kind of odd, I sort of think ... and I don't know if he ever thinks about that ... so ... it will be kind of weird.\"\n\nEven more interestingly, \"James\", in his early 40s, paradoxically feared that his children would adopt the very views that many of us actively encourage in our children - that race is irrelevant: \"I think what really bothers me is I don't want them to forget that race matters. That race affects people's life chances. I want them to help me and to help the world make it different.\"\n\nThese are not the words of white racists or black supremacists, but mixed-race people who have a white parent, a white partner and children who interface with the world as if they are white. However unexpected such sentiments seem, there is real honesty and intimacy in how they were conveyed in that study. Most importantly, whatever concerns parents may have about their children's sense of identity, it will be for that next generation to work it out for themselves. What troubles their parents may not worry them at all.\n\nMy parents brought me up to believe that racial integration - including interracial marriage - is not only a good thing but is the natural progression of a healthy society. I still believe that. They also taught me that \"race\" is largely a \"social construct\" that limits us, and we should strive to see it as irrelevant. But the Kent study and the new generation of mixed-race Britons may force us to question that.\n\nIt reveals that many first-generation mixed-race parents do not want their children entirely to ignore or \"transcend\" race, not least because they see race as part of their cultural heritage. It is as much something to be valued as something to be \"outgrown\".\n\nWe have always imagined that children discarding a sense of racial identity would be liberating for them. But the Kent study surprisingly suggests it can also result in a sense of loss. Even more bewilderingly, those two contradictory feelings will often exist side by side.\n\nThe artistic director of the Young Vic, Kwame Kwei-Armah , believes the story of second-generation mixed-race Britons to be one of the most interesting cultural narratives yet to be told. A few months ago, he produced a series of short dramas, Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle , for BBC Four.

      "text": "Another Side Of The Evergreen State College Story\n\nFaculty, The Evergreen State College\n\nFaculty, The Evergreen State College\n\nEmeritus faculty, The Evergreen State College\n\nIf you've read reports about the recent crisis at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, they probably focused on white professor Bret Weinstein claiming that whites were \"ordered\" off campus, facing an unruly crowd of student protesters, leaving the campus in \"fear,\" and suing the college for $3.8 million. As a simple story with a single hero, it works well on YouTube videos and Facebook memes. But the real significance of this story has hardly been reported at all.\n\nIn the last two months former Evergreen Provost Michael Zimmerman published four articles on HuffPost , repeating and amplifying this version of our recent history. But in nearly 8,700 words, Zimmerman couldn't find one word to mention the threat of a massacre on his own campus, and how it created fear among students, staff, and faculty of color. He did not use one word to report on the far-right rally that brought riot police to campus and intimidated staff into leaving, nor one word about the racist hate mail that students, staff and faculty of color are receiving ―the same people he blames for the crisis.\n\nIn this article, we hope to connect the dots between conservative attacks on campus diversity and equity programs, the far-right white nationalist resurgence, the retrenchment of government programs supporting equal opportunity and diversity, and the events on our campus.\n\nA toxic brew of \"alt-right\" (far right), white supremacist, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and anti-Communist ideologies is growing along the West Coast that targets college campuses as a primary enemy, with Evergreen at or near the top of the list. These groups' primary argument is that their free speech rights are being violated by \"Social Justice Warriors\" (or \"SJWs\"), whom they demonize as deranged \"mobs\" practicing \"reverse racism.\" But even as they attempt to disassociate themselves from overt bigotry, their followers continue to commit threats and acts of violence.\n\nAt the same time, Washington State conservative leaders have targeted the college, denouncing \"suppression of free speech,\" characterizing student behavior as \"violent,\" and insisting that our administration show \"strength\" by taking harsh disciplinary action. These initiatives are occurring as the Trump administration directs its Justice Department to monitor and dismantle rights-based programs in colleges, including affirmative action, and as congressional committees hold hearings on the suppression of conservative views on campuses, while ignoring other forms of exclusion.\n\nIn this article we present ten issues that are not being reported, or whose significance has been overlooked or erased. This silencing doesn't just affect Evergreen, it poses a threat to equity and diversity programs throughout higher education.\n\nIn recent months, conservative and far-right forces have intensified their targeting of higher education, particularly outspoken faculty members who stand up for equity and diversity. In HuffPost , Matthew Houghly describes, \"increasingly organized attacks on college and university faculty who are critical of, and public about, social inequality. Attacks seem most virulent when the faculty are people of color and/or when they critique white supremacy.\"\n\nAs Victor Ray documented in Inside Higher Ed : \"The political right has developed a coordinated network to systematically target the free speech of presumably left-wing professors ... This network of activists has launched a vicious series of attacks, leading to intimidation, calls for firing and even death threats. Colleges and universities have shut down operations, while scholars have canceled speaking engagements and even gone into hiding with their families.\"\n\nChris Quintana in the Chronicle of Higher Education shows how \"some scholars have become increasingly alarmed in recent weeks about professors who have come under intense criticism for controversial remarks. Prominent scholars...have voiced their frustrations with how quickly some colleges and universities have distanced themselves from scholars who are targeted by right-wing media websites.\"\n\nElliot Kaufman predicts in The National Review : \"the academy is primed to be a punching bag for the GOP's next standard-bearer, just as the media was in 2016.\" In the past two years, the percentage of Republicans who think colleges and universities had a positive effect on the country dropped from 65 to 36 percent.\n\nSteven Thrasher notes in The Guardian , \"Listening to talking heads on both the left and the right, you'd think that America is facing a freedom of speech crisis. But the crisis isn't what it's made out to be.\" White conservatives \"are not lacking in a freedom to speak...It's women and people of color who struggle the most finding a platform - but there is a conspicuous lack of concern about that by free speech crusaders.\"\n\nFrom Tucker Carlson's nightly obsession with \"campus craziness,\" to Milo Yiannapoulos's racist and transphobic diatribes, to militias such as the Three-Percenters and \"Proud Boys\" and the \"Campus Reform\" group targeting professors, higher education is under sustained assault.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Evergreen, a public liberal arts institution with a history of social justice teaching and student activism, would be one of the main campuses to be targeted. Although Evergreen's suggested reforms for greater inclusion, equity, and diversity are relatively mild, right-wing forces have made the college a poster child for their campaigns. They have especially targeted students, staff and faculty of color who have used their free speech rights to bring public attention to racist practices on campus.\n\nIn order for a propaganda campaign to succeed, it needs a Big Lie. At Evergreen, the Big Lie is that Evergreen's Day of Absence demonstrated \"reverse racism\" as whites \"were forced to leave campus because of the color of their skin.\" It is stunning to us how often this \"alternative fact\" has been repeated until it has become unchallenged truth. The truth is that the Day of Absence has long been an accepted - and voluntary - practice at Evergreen. On the Day of Absence, people of color who chose to do so generally attended an off-campus event, while whites who chose to participate stayed on campus to attend lectures, workshops and discussions about how race and racism shape social structures and everyday life. Many classes embraced the opportunity of Day of Absence to focus attention on how racism has impacted their own disciplines. For instance: a scientist might choose to address how race has historically and inaccurately been traced to genetic differences. A filmmaker might look at the histories of exclusion of people of color from mainstream filmmaking, or cultural stereotypes of race. The Day of Absence follows an important tradition of caucusing, in which people who share a common identity find value in creating autonomous space to share experiences. At Evergreen the Day of Absence is always followed by a Day of Presence where people have the opportunity to reconnect to the larger community by participating in shared learning activities, including a keynote speaker, a performance, and workshops .\n\nLast spring the organizers switched the two events; the event for students of color was held on-campus, and the event for white students was held off-campus. As always, participation in some form was assumed, but attendance at the events was voluntary; the announcement to the campus read, \"On Day of Absence, you can choose how and where to participate.\" Nevertheless, faculty member Bret Weinstein denounced it on the faculty listserv, arguing that the college was engaging in \"a show of force\" and that whites were being coerced to leave campus. Although numerous colleagues attempted to show Weinstein that he was mistaken, he persisted, urging the college to \"set phenotype aside.\"\n\nEvergreen's Director of First Peoples Multicultural Advising Services invited Weinstein to discuss and clarify the purpose of Day of Absence, but he never responded. As Evergreen professor Jon Davies put it in the Seattle Times , the Day of Absence is \"always voluntary, always something people could participate in or not. To characterize it as mandated? It's very hard to mandate anybody to do anything on this campus.\"\n\nOn the April 12 Day of Absence, the off-campus event took place at a local church which had space for only 200 people. Since the white student body numbers about 2,800, it was obvious that more than 90 percent of white students would not be able to attend. Not all people of color chose to attend the on-campus event either. Many faculty who understood the principle of caucusing found ways instead to incorporate the discussions into their class themes. For example, a class on natural disasters watched documentaries on the history of racism, and discussed how racism contributed to the damage caused by disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\"Reverse racism\" against whites (like \"states' rights\") has long been a key trope used to critique civil rights. Weinstein was espousing an ideology of \"color-blindness\" that denies the depths of racism in our society. H. Richard Milner IV, director of the Center for Urban Education at the University of Pittsburgh, explains that \"color blindness\" on the part of college faculty and staff contributes to \"opportunity gaps,\" as key parts of students' identities and experiences go unseen. Weinstein's opposition to the Day of Absence was part of his continuing campaign against the college's equity emphasis, including our Equity Council's proposal to prioritize the needs of struggling students of color and first-generation students.\n\nWhen the Council made a mild suggestion that the college should actively recruit faculty (of any race) with the knowledge and skills to teach about race, Weinstein commented, \"In order to find professors who are good at what we Evergreen professors do, we need the largest pool of applicants possible. If we are prioritizing race over everything else, we would succeed in finding those unusual professors much less often.\" Essentially debunking affirmative action, Weinstein's stance, similar to the Trump administration's insistence that affirmative-action \"discriminates\" against whites in universities, ignored the history of exclusion of people of color from faculty positions, and failed to explain why faculty of color would not be equally adept at the teaching Evergreen values.\n\nThe misleading claim that the Day of Absence was \"reverse racism\" caused confusion on campus. Some faculty believed Weinstein's claims of coercion, or out of a sense of humility or guilt they stayed away from campus, or suggested that their white students stay away. This confusion confirms one of the problems identified by our Equity Council: many faculty whose disciplines do not include extensive examination of race and culture sometimes lack the tools to address these issues in the classroom. (Imagine if a social scientist had started aggressively denying that humans cause climate change, and other social scientists found they were ill-equipped to address such denial in their classrooms.) The Council proposed that faculty trainings would deepen understanding of racism's underlying institutional structures, rather than viewing it as merely individual guilt or \"prejudice\" that can be overcome with an \"I don't see color\" reaction. Trainings would offer opportunities to listen to faculty, staff, and students who have studied or lived these realities for years or decades.\n\nThe spring-quarter protests at Evergreen were a long time in coming, and have multiple origins, just like student of color protests at other campuses around the country. Students, staff, and faculty of color have been trying for years to have their perspectives and experiences heard and respected by the administration (including former Provost Zimmerman), but have not been listened to. In the words of one African-American staff member, the protests \"didn't appear out of nowhere.\"\n\nIn May 2015 two young African American brothers were shot by police in Olympia, not far from campus, after they allegedly shoplifted beer from a grocery store and assaulted a police officer with a skateboard. One man is paralyzed for life and both were sentenced to prison, while the officer was exonerated. This incident brought the message of the Black Lives Matter movement home to Evergreen in a particularly urgent way. Some students had participated in the Black Lives Matter movement before arriving at Evergreen, while others joined a community group that provided support to the wounded men. The event and its troubling aftermath focused community attention on problematic behavior by campus police, student conduct officers, and faculty.\n\nIn spring 2016 African American students and their allies brought their concerns about racism to the administration. The administration responded by forming the Equity Council and pledging to focus institutional resources on dismantling institutional barriers. In fall 2016 African-American students challenged a Convocation speaker to once again call attention to their concerns about institutional racism. In winter 2017 students objected to disciplinary action against black trans students, protested for equal pay for student employees who work in the diversity office and denounced the behavior of campus police who responded to a complaint against two Black students by rousting them from their beds and confining them in the police station for hours. A proposal to address Latinx student recruitment and retention resulted in promises but little action. Many students of color felt disrespected and not listened to. Bret Weinstein came to symbolize a dismissive attitude that was being enacted in multiple areas of the college. By the time students disrupted Weinstein's class, in May 2017, they had been waiting for over a year - more than a quarter of their time at the college - to see their concerns addressed.\n\nThese bottled-up resentments are visible in the infamous May 23rd video of students confronting Weinstein over his Day of Absence claims, and the May 24th occupation of the president's office. The students used tactics of disruption and confrontation that often occur in social movements, whatever their political orientation. They were far less unruly than protests of the 1960s that are remembered and romanticized by some of the same people who criticize students' actions today. Weinstein's sensational claims that the president, faculty and staff were \"kidnapped,\" and that \"mob rule\" and \"anarchy\" ruled the campus have been vigorously denied by Evergreen President George Bridges. They certainly don't mesh with the reality of the negotiations we witnessed. Some disruptions were problematic and counterproductive, as the May 23 rd video began to go viral, giving right-wing groups a meme they had been looking for to hammer Evergreen. Still, a series of meetings attended by faculty, staff and hundreds of students produced welcome promises for reform. Many of us supported the proposed changes, and most of us thought the crisis would be resolved through a renewed commitment to dialogue and institutional change.\n\nAll that changed on May 26th, when Weinstein appeared on Tucker Carlson's show on FOX. The segment was labeled \"Campus Craziness\" and appeared under the banner that Evergreen had ordered \"All White People Leave Campus OR ELSE!!\"\n\nWeinstein failed to correct Carlson's sensationalist distortions of the Day of Absence. He did not explain the larger reasons for the Evergreen protests, characteristically putting himself at the center of the story. Weinstein had the right to do the interview, but that didn't make it the right decision. His interview, and the subsequent tweets he sent about \"black supremacists,\" were judgment calls he knew full well would unleash vitriol and far-right threats against his colleagues.\n\nZimmerman would have us believe that for Weinstein's detractors, appearing on a conservative network should be taboo. He has argued that this is the mark of a culture that is intolerant of free speech. But the problem was never simply appearing on FOX; it was the show's use of a false message to mobilize a specific virulent audience. Although Tucker Carlson used to be a genuine conservative, in recent months he has become a darling of the alt-right (as documented by Haaretz , \" How Fox News' Rising Star Tucker Carlson Is Winning Over White Supremacist America \"). MediaMatters has written , \"the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer has been regularly posting clips of Carlson's interviews... the site's founder, calls Carlson 'our greatest ally'.\"\n\nWe feared the interview would be followed by a dramatic escalation in hate mail and far-right threats, and it was. Weinstein is entitled to voice his opinions, however ill-informed we consider them to be. But his participation in such a toxic forum demonstrated complete lack of interest in the safety and well-being of our community. Even after the Carlson interview went viral, Weinstein continued using Twitter and any media outlet available to push his extreme misrepresentations of the college - in the words of one faculty member, \"pouring gasoline on the fire.\" Continually casting himself as the victim, he ignored the violent counter-reaction created by right-wing media, a counter-reaction which makes the acts of the unruly Evergreen students seem mild in comparison.\n\nOn May 26, the same day Tucker Carlson interviewed Weinstein's interview, far-right activist Jeremy Christian slashed the throats of three men who had intervened to protect two African American women (one of them Muslim) from his assault on the Portland MAX train. Two of the men died. A month earlier, Christian had attended a protest of \"Patriot Prayer,\" an anti-Communist, anti-Muslim anti-immigrant group led by Joey Gibson. Only five days after the fatal attack, on May 31, Gibson appeared on the program of Seattle right-wing radio talk show host Dori Monson, promising that his group would come to the defense of Weinstein's \"free speech\" by protesting at Evergreen.\n\nThe toxic and intimidating atmosphere created by right-wing media inevitably led to a physical threat to Evergreen the next day on June 1st, when an anonymous person called to say he was on his way to \"Evergreen University\" to \"execute as many people on that campus as I can get a hold of... You communist, scumbag town.\" When law enforcement officers and the FBI decided the threat was credible, campus was evacuated for two days. It was closed on a third day when new threats were received.\n\nFears of a school massacre, just a week after the Portland slayings, permeated the campus. While most students left campus, students who lived in the dorms could not leave and did not trust campus police to defend them. The students reported hearing trucks gunning their motors on the back roads behind the dorms, and drivers shouting racist slurs. They describe holing up in dorm rooms for safety and finding it impossible to sleep. In response, they organized a \"Community Watch\" and armed themselves with baseball bats. Like the disruptions of the previous week, the baseball bats were problematic and counterproductive, and after conversations with administration and faculty, the students put them down. But the threat of a massacre (never even mentioned by Zimmerman) offers some context to understand why some students might have seen the bats as a way to protect themselves. (A New Jersey man was later charged with \"making terroristic threats\" against the college.)\n\nTwo weeks after the terrorist threat, on June 15, Joey Gibson carried out his promised alt-right rally at Evergreen. Gibson and the media usually portray his \"Patriot Prayer\" group as merely pro-Trump \"conservatives\" or \"libertarians.\" But Gibson's rallies not only supported President Trump, but have served as cover for far-right ultranationalists and white supremacists gathered around his \"Warriors for Freedom\" gang.\n\nThe college responded to the disruption by closing its doors; in the name of campus safety, staff were let out early and buildings were locked. The rally drew about 75-100 people supporting Weinstein and opposing campus equity and diversity programs. They were met by a counterpresence of more than 200 campus members and Olympia community supporters who carried banners opposing fascism and supporting \"Community Love,\" a slogan of the recent student of color protests. A huge force of riot-clad Washington State Patrol officers separated the two sides with metal barricades. Gibson's followers displayed all the covert \"dog whistle\" expressions of fascism understood within the far-right movement, including the \"Kekistan\" Nazi flag symbol, and the alt-right frog meme Pepe, along with other fascist symbols. The Nazi \"Atomwaffen Division\" had put up posters around Evergreen the previous week. As Evergreen student Jacqueline Littleton headlined her New York Times op-ed , \" The Media Brought the Alt-Right to My Campus .\"\n\nDevin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights observed, \"As someone who's monitored white nationalist activity for the last 25 years, I can state―without reservation―that the evidence of dangerous far-right activity at the Olympia rally is incontrovertible... The flags, banners, hats, t-shirts and other paraphernalia in the crowd represented a melding of white nationalists and Alt-Right activists with the far-right paramilitaries of the Three Percenters and militia-types.\"\n\nOne of Zimmerman's HuffPost articles displayed a photo of the riot police without any context, implying they were there only because of the student protests. Other media outlets have repeated the untrue assertion that student protests were responsible for riot police presence, and for the closure of the campuses. Far from defending \"free speech\" Gibson's rally intimidated members of the Evergreen community from remaining on their own campus to exercise their free speech rights. Any fascist demonstration on a progressive campus is calculated to intimidate those practicing social change and free speech. The far-right could have cowed the community into silence and invisibility - fortunately, it didn't. The next day, due to security concerns, Evergreen held its annual graduation in a Tacoma stadium 40 miles from campus; during the ceremony elected student speakers of color and first-generation students celebrated their achievements and those of their peers. Acknowledging the urgency of the student protests, the faculty graduation speaker urged reflection \"on the community we have not yet accomplished and are now being asked to accomplish, a community that has justice and inclusion at its center.\"\n\nAs Littleton observed in her New York Times op-ed , Weinstein's interview \"became a call to arms for internet trolls and the alt-right. Online vigilantes from 4chan, Reddit and other forums swarmed to unearth Evergreen students' contact information. They have harassed us with hundreds of phone calls, anonymous texts and terrifyingly specific threats of violence that show they know where we live and work.\"\n\nAn anonymous poster on the 4chan \"Politically Incorrect\" page asked on May 31 , \"I live in the same town as evergreen college, does /pol/ have any special requests?,\" and received numerous responses such as \"Fertilizer bomb, \"Burn a cross on the campus,\" \"Put some signs up that say we support our white professors, ni**ers get out,\" \"Swastika and 14/88 [white power] graffiti on campus,\" and \"100 4chan points for every dead student, 200 for professor, 500 for administrator,\" and \"Mustard gas please... Burn the entire fu**ing place to the goddam ground.\" This was only one example of many, many such pages on far-right social media, which inspired numerous emails such as one received by two white women faculty on June 2: \"You radical bit**es need to rein your asses in... The days of anti White male hatred, intolerance and bigotry are over.\"\n\nMany faculty who signed a statement in solidarity with student demands received similar emails and posts.\n\nAfrican American staff members and faculty were particularly singled out for racist abuse online and in emails. One black faculty member was called a \"gorilla\" and received numerous hate mail messages along the lines of \"I hope you get fu**ing lynched you fat piece of ni**er sh*t.\" This professor was one of those who held their classes off campus after the shooter threat.\n\nOn July 22, alt-right agitator Milo Yiannopolous targeted the same faculty member in a Facebook video with 290,000 views. As per his usual tactic, he published contact information to explicitly direct harassment and violent threats toward her. She was deluged with 40-50 racist hate mail messages per day, including \"no one owes you a fu**ing thing you fat c**t. Certainly not white people. The only thing you deserve is for someone to punch you in your fu**ing head.\"\n\nAs Weinstein and the media complained about the students who yelled and called him \"racist,\" there was a deafening silence about the systematic, directed intimidation of Evergreen faculty, staff, and students of color. The administration and Board of Trustees made no official statements condemning it, nor did the national media report on it, beyond a New York Times report of African-American staff and faculty \"being mercilessly ridiculed online\" - an understatement that masked the full reality.\n\nWhat about the free speech of those who are part of the campaign to create greater equity and diversity on our campus? What about their ability to do their jobs and express their academic freedom without fear of intimidation and violence? What about the education of the students whose faculty and advisors have been forced to go into hiding or hold their classes in secret?\n\nThroughout this crisis the viewpoint of one white professor and his supporters has outweighed the experience of a large community of students, staff, and faculty who have been deliberately terrorized, threatened, and demonized. Furthermore, the recent Portland murders, school shooter threat, and violent backgrounds of some of the alt-right activists who rallied at Evergreen, confirm the physical reality behind the threats. It is no accident that many readers of this article are hearing the other side of the story for the first time-because so many at Evergreen fear the emails, online abuse, and threatening calls they would have to endure if they speak out.\n\nThe drama unfolding at Evergreen quickly intersected with state and national efforts to constrain public colleges and universities. On May 31, State Representative Matt Manweller (political science professor at Central Washington University) submitted a \"request for investigation\" to the Washington State Human Rights Commission. He reiterated Weinstein's assertion that he was subjected to race-based exclusion; the Commission chose not to take up the request. Manweller also sent a letter to Evergreen's Director of Government Relations, stating, \"Evergreen students are an embarrassment.\" He called the college leadership cowardly and complicit, adding, \"My colleagues and I have had enough of this ridiculous behavior fostered at our public institutions.\" A few days later, with the support of 14 Republican representatives, he submitted House Bill 2221, proposing \"transitioning The Evergreen State College to a private four-year institution of higher education.\" Senator Fortunato introduced the companion Senate Bill 5946 to reduce state support for the college in a planned regression of funding over five years, culminating in a sale to a private party, echoing similar proposals from the 1970s and '80s.\n\nManweller's bill sends a message to public higher education in our state that it is being scrutinized, and threatened with budget cuts, privatization, receivership or closure. This is not Manweller's first attempt; last year he introduced a bill to \"protect free speech\" in Washington's public colleges that was characterized by higher education advocates as \"legislative overreach.\" But this spring's drama at Evergreen provided another occasion to go after public higher ed. Four days after Evergreen's graduation, the State Senate's Law and Justice Committee convened a work session on \"Safety at The Evergreen State College.\" Besides Manweller; invited speakers were President Bridges, a faculty member who spoke as a proxy for Bret Weinstein, and representatives of the campus, county and state police. The session framed the Evergreen story as a crisis of law and order, with scant attention directed to racial equity, educational mission, or the safety and well-being of all students, staff and faculty. Yet none of the faculty, staff or students who have been put at risk by threats to the campus were invited, and public comment was not permitted. Although the \"Evergreen bills\" were never brought to the floor, they reflect a readiness on the right to summarily discipline colleges and universities with invasive scrutiny, if not full-scale penalties or even dissolution. Still Rep. Drew Hansen, Democratic chair of the House Higher Education Committee signaled that \"We're not going to end public funding at Evergreen, or any other public university, because of student protests.\"\n\nHigher education's struggles to overcome institutional barriers to equity are taking place in an increasingly hostile environment at the federal level as well. On July 27 the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform convened a hearing on \"the undermining of free speech in higher education.\" The committee heard from several invited witnesses, including Michael Zimmerman. Committee Chair Representative Jordan stated that his committee was \"committed...to help colleges reinstate freedom of speech as an important protection.\" Although Zimmerman argued against the \"historical silencing\" of marginalized people, he also singled out for criticism a 'radical left' among college professors, and the rise of \"a post-modern agenda,\" which is \"causing great harm.\" He called on college administrators to show \"strength,\" echoing groups such as Campus Reform that are positioning Evergreen as a test case for what happens when progressive campuses are not properly disciplined.\n\nThe double standard has been astonishing, as we watch people who claim to be \"even-handed\" in their politics uphold the \"free speech\" of white supremacists, while condemning as \"intolerant radical leftists\" those who exercise their own free speech to challenge hate speech. What has been happening at Evergreen is a conflict between different parties and beliefs, with both sides exercising free speech. Nevertheless, some media have equated having an unpopular political opinion on a campus to being a marginalized racial or gender \"minority.\" Radio host Bryan Fischer lionizes Bret Weinstein as \"Rosa Parks\" for \"refusing to go the back of the diversity bus.\"\n\nA diversity of ideological viewpoints is not the same as diversity of identities. Having a political viewpoint that doesn't match the majority viewpoint on a campus does not lead to a shorter life span, nor does it create fear of being assaulted in a routine police stop, or lead to higher suicide rates. Identities connected to race or LGBTQ status do all these things in 21 st -century America.\n\nAs one Evergreen staff member described the student protesters' decisions, \"it is clear that if you are not a white college student, you will certainly pay for your mistakes long after the 30 minutes have passed and be described in terms that cement the fear people have about angry or insistent people of color. No one will ever focus on what the reasons for that anger might be, but rather the fact that they dared to voice it.\"\n\nEvergreen is not the first place where white moderates have criticized people fighting against injustice more than the injustice itself. These words from Martin Luther King's 1963 \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" were never truer than today:\n\nI have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods.'\n\nThe goal of a liberal arts education is to draw from different disciplines. The goal of intersectionality is to connect the experiences of diverse communities. The backlash against liberal arts and intersectionality is about reducing or demeaning \"identity politics\" in the public discourse. We constantly hear that for \"minority\" groups to express their own identities takes away from our identities as Americans or human beings. As an example, \"All Lives Matter\" has been offered as a counter to the Black Lives Matter movement. In exalting Weinstein as \"Rosa Parks,\" Pastor Fischer asserts that \"strength does not come from diversity, as the left endlessly bleats, but from unity.\" An August 3rd Wall Street Journal editorial equated the critique of Eurocentric approaches to scholarship with a quest for \"not knowledge but power\" and cited specific Evergreen classes as an example of \"ridiculous\" course offerings.) In a similar way, former Provost Zimmerman condemns Evergreen as \"a place where identity politics takes precedence,\" ignoring the numerous programs on social class, environmental studies, and other cross-cutting themes.\n\nBut the problem students have identified is that higher education has paid short shrift to their identities, with faculty not speaking up against prejudiced statements in the classroom, or opting out of discussing social issues if they do not fit their discipline or curriculum. In the natural sciences, for example, issues of race and culture could easily be incorporated by introducing environmental justice research or tribal salmon habitat restoration. Such simple reforms make the connection between \"identity politics\" and universal themes that unify people, and help them (as one of Evergreen's five foci state) to \"learn across significant differences.\"\n\nInstead of exploring how pedagogy can bridge identity differences and explore unifying similarities, Weinstein and his followers advocate a strategy to \"set aside\" race, and \"not talk so much\" about race and gender. One purpose of the Day of Absence was for students to widen their awareness beyond themselves, and understand the perspectives of people with different life experiences, and how these might relate to their own. Intersectionality is a hallmark of a liberal arts education, not its opposite. A liberal arts education should never \"set aside\" anything.\n\nThe goal of equity and diversity programs is to widen awareness. The goal of those who want to shut them down is to narrow or constrict debate to prioritize dominant perspectives. Only when a white professor objects to equity proposals do we suddenly hear about the importance of listening and understanding others' perspectives. That's not only true at Evergreen but at many institutions around the country.\n\nAs Provost, Zimmerman could have done a lot to practice such listening, bring people together and head off the current crisis. Instead, he was one of the administrators who students and faculty of color felt did not listen to them and put off their concerns. Despite his current defense of free speech, he sparked his own free-speech controversy in 2014 when he attempted to cancel a project to perform a play LGBTQ students had written that satirized Disney films.\n\nZimmerman also tried to institute an Evergreen program on a Wyoming reservation, without first adequately consulting with and getting approval from the tribal government.\n\nRather than join the right in labeling Weinstein's critics as \"radical left,\" or a \"vocal minority,\" Zimmerman could humbly and reflexively examine his own policies, and how they might have helped to prevent the crisis. At the very least, he could acknowledge the pain and fear that students, faculty, and staff, particularly those of color, have faced since May. Instead, as the former provost, Zimmerman has an axe to grind with the administration of President George Bridges. He began grinding it on HuffPost on July 2 , as soon as he could legally do so under his administrative contract.\n\nThere has been a lot of anger at Evergreen, as on many other campuses. When people are angry and feel unheard they often make statements and commit actions they may later regret. But wherever the Greener community goes next, we can agree that the Evergreen spring has been a long time coming. Now is a time for us to listen to our students, and act for a more positive future. We hope to look back at this period a decade from now, and proudly say that Evergreen rose to the occasion and found creative, innovative ways to defuse conflict, lessen polarization, and take needed steps to support the learning of all our students.\n\nWhatever one's opinions about student actions or demands, we should understand that the current situation cannot be reduced to a single issue or person. Action is long overdue. When changes that were within the college's decision-making authority were not made, student demands were redirected outside that structure, leading to polarization and confrontation. Now that they have the college's attention, the students have put forward proposals that the administration has promised to consider and act on. Hopefully, the power relations on our campus will be restructured so the Equity Council's concerns can be addressed, rather than having to pressure the administration from the outside.\n\nWe, concerned faculty at Evergreen, look forward to participating in a process through which we learn to better understand the concerns and lived experiences of students, faculty and staff of color. We believe that reforming Evergreen's programs and making them more conducive to equity and diversity will make the college stronger. We are hopeful that faculty, staff and students will find ways to connect identity differences and unifying similarities, and meet the needs of communities of color while at the same time widening the experiences and engagement of whites. Change can be challenging and uncomfortable; it can also be energizing and optimistic. At Evergreen we are optimistic that we can meet the challenge of creating a more inclusive future.\n\nAnne Fischel has taught media and community studies at Evergreen since 1989, and was the 2017 elected faculty graduation speaker.

      "text": "The National Association for the Advancement of Cowardly Pawns: NAACP President Ben Jealous Should Resign for Assisting in the Sherrod Assault\n\nMathematician, TheWarrenGroup.biz\n\nIn late July 2010, Ben Jealous, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, denounced Shirley Sherrod, a black woman whom Jealous said \"in her position at USDA [the Department of Agriculture]... mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race.\" Jealous knew this because a right-wing website told him so.\n\nBen Jealous committed two mistakes, and one crime. First, Ms. Sherrod was not working for the USDA at the time of the incident, but for an organization specifically dedicated to black farmers ; and in fact, according to the white farmer, Sherrod saved his farm. But what if Sherrod had said what the Right Wing claimed she said? What if Sherrod really had not used \" the full force \" of her office to help the white farmer?\n\nThat's not \"mistreatment,\" even if Ben Jealous pretends it is. It was even argued in the Supreme Court that \"a police officer who came upon four people beating someone could stand by without intervening\".\n\nStill Jealous was not done. \"Her actions were shameful,\" he said of Sherrod, and, channeling Senator Joe McCarthy, Jealous promised, \"We will be looking into the behavior of NAACP representatives at this local event [where Sherrod told her story] and take any appropriate action.\"\n\nInteresting. According to Jealous's own definition, I was \"mistreated\"―by the NAACP. Specifically, by Ben Jealous.\n\nOn November 20, 2002, when I was a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, I wrote in the city newspaper that a relatively new, local, taxpayer-funded statue honoring the founder of the Ku Klux Klan should be torn down. The death threats commenced.\n\nBoth the head of my university, Gordon Gee, and the university spokesman, Michael Schoenfeld, defended the Klan founder―Gee called the Klan founder's supporters \" old friends ,\" and denounced me for having criticized the Confederacy. Obama White House Fellow Samar Ali , then a student at Vanderbilt, even said that, in criticizing the Confederacy, I had engaged in \" hate speech ,\" that criticism of the Confederacy was \"racist.\" Math Department chairman Mike Mihalik said any hostile letters he received about me from Klan supporters would be put in my file and forwarded to the dean, but not shown to me, and Dean Richard McCarty subsequently threatened my job.\n\nAs a Life Member, I went to the NAACP for help.\n\nThe head of the NAACP in the southeast, Reverend Charles White, was apprised of the situation but said the NAACP could only take action after considering the matter at its next board meeting―in three months. The president of the Nashville chapter of the NAACP, Reverend Sonnye Dixon , even said it could be good for Vanderbilt to have a building called \"Confederate Memorial Hall\" on its campus.\n\nBen Jealous's wife, Lia Epperson-Jealous, worked for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and at my request informed a colleague of hers, attorney John R. Harper; but when I asked Harper for help, he did nothing. Ben Jealous later blamed me for having \"asked for\" the attack.\n\nThe Nashville NAACP did, however, give Gordon Gee an award in 2003. Which he declined to pick up.\n\nOverall, no one in the NAACP or the NAACP Legal Defense Fund gave me \"the full force of what they could do.\"\n\nWill Ben Jealous call the actions of Ben Jealous \"shameful\"? Will Ben Jealous call for an investigation into the actions of the Nashville NAACP?\n\nNo, because you have the right not to do everything you can for someone.\n\nJealous's second mistake is that the NAACP is not the National Association for the Abolition of Color Prejudice. It is not the NAACP's mission to protect the civil rights of white farmers, just as it is not the mission of the American Poultry Association to investigate whether cell phones cause gingivitis. In theory, if there were such creatures as black supremacists, the NAACP would represent them, too, over, say, Barack Obama 's mother or Ben Jealous's father .\n\nBut that wasn't Jealous's crime. His normally sluggish organization, which took three months even to discuss what to do, if anything, when a Life Member was receiving death threats from Klan supporters, reacted in one day when racist liars, who wanted a black woman's head, ordered the heir of W. E. B. Du Bois to step and fetch it.\n\nNAACP president Ben Jealous should resign for slavishly serving right-wing racists, and the now embarrassingly useless NAACP should disband.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "#OscarsSoWhite Creator to Chris Rock: Do The Right Thing\n\nWriter, filmmaker, and multi-media storyteller\n\nDescribing the moment when she started the viral #OscarsSoWhite campaign, April Reign says was inspired by Spike Lee's 1989 film Do the Right Thing, seeing in the Oscar nominations of 2015 the equivalent of \"no brothers and sisters up on the wall in Sal's Pizzeria.\"\n\nSpeaking to me during an interview for the podcast Below The Fold , April describes how frustration quickly turned to humor when she took to twitter with \"#OscarsSoWhite they want to touch my hair.\"\n\n\"It started out as a joke,\" April told me. \"Then the conversation turned into something much more serious expanding into a discussion about the lack of representation in film.\n\nListen to the full interview with April Reign below.\n\nNow, with Chris Rock hosting the live broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday night, the conversation will certainly come back to humor.\n\nNot that April will be watching.\n\nApril does not call her action a boycott, but she will be involved in what she calls counter-programing, using her twitter account (named top 15 #Black Twitter accounts by The National Journal) to live tweet the coming of age film The Wood during the broadcast Sunday evening.\n\nIronically, it is the success of April's viral #OscarsSoWhite campaign that makes this year's live televised show, with Chris Rock serving as the MC for an Academy Award Ceremony in which a grand total of zero black actors were nominated in the individual acting award categories, must see television.\n\n\"There is no one better (than Chris Rock) to be hosting the awards this year,\" says April. \"I fully expect him to bring it, and I (also) think the Academy does.\"\n\nThe coming Chris Rock moment -- a black berry filled with sweet juice -- is ripe with potential.\n\nWith the reverberations of Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl halftime show wherein she honored the Black Panthers and Malcolm X still sending ripples of energy around the world, followed by Kendrick Lamar's absolutely stunning #BlackLivesMatter performance at the Grammy's that almost literally burned down the house in an evening that also saw Hamilton, a Broadway musical that tells the story of the American revolution by consciously recasting the founding fathers as people of color -- mostly African American men -- walk away with some hardware adds to the groundswell of waves crisscrossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring.\n\nChris Rock will step to the mic on Sunday night to host the Oscars at a cultural and historical moment with the opportunity to sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\n\nOk, perhaps I'm overstating things a bit, but you get the point.\n\nSo will Chris Rock take Beyoncé's lead and step into formation? Rock is a comedian with a unique ability to shape historical moments from a perspective that both disquieting and unimpeachable.\n\n\"When you see footage of the 60's and see black people getting sprayed down and hosed down and dogs getting sicked on us and little girls getting burnt up in churches... that's just white people being nice. Nicer than they was in the 50s and 40s and 30s.\"\n\n- Chris Rock\n\nSpeaking of the 1960s, among the movies singled out in Ibram X. Kendi's must-read article at Salon entitled The 15 most racist Oscar films of all time is the 1968 film Planet of the Apes. As Kendi talks of the Academy's history of promoting racist narratives and summarizes the Planet of the Apes in the following way:\n\n\"Black people had long been likened to apes in racist mythology. And so, it is hardly a stretch to say the film's apes--who enslave the White astronauts after their long space journey--signify Black people in this movie. After one White astronaut escapes, he comes upon a rusted Statue of Liberty, and suddenly realizes he's back on earth. After years of domestic and foreign antiracist rebellions, racist Americans actually feared a violent Black revolution could be on the horizon in early 1968--fears reflected in \"Planet of the Apes.\" To racist whites, there could only be white supremacists or Black supremacists in power. An equitable society is beyond the racist imagination.\"\n\nWhile some can argue that arc of the moral universe has been bending towards justice since 1968, #BlackLivesMatter forces us to face the fact that it is bending slowly. As historical moments go -- we are still in the thick of this one, but things might trending in a positive direction.\n\nThe Pew research center has been tracking Americans' views on race relations since 1986, the year Martin Luther King day was first observed as a national holiday. A summary of the center's most recent findings, released in January of this year , notes that six in 10 Americans thinks the country needs to continue making changes to assure that blacks have equal rights with whites, a substantial increase over the previous year, and a growing share think that racism is a big problem in our society. Furthermore a majority of Americans now give police a poor grade when it comes to treating people of color equally. The summary of findings also notes that 57 percent of people supported the removal of the Confederate flag form State grounds in South Carolina.\n\nFor those of us, white like me, it sure is easy to get excited about progress while still reaping the rewards -- sought or unsought -- of white privilege in a systemically racist society. However, are we really ready to call it progress when more than four in 10 people think that the flag representing slavery should remain up on state grounds paid for by the taxes of the ancestors of slaves?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

U.S. Supreme Court to consider Mississippi abortion ban designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. U.S. Supreme Court will also hear case involving Second Amendment rights this week. Supreme Court hears challenges to Texas abortion ban brought by providers and DOJ.\n\nARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: So, keep it right here, THE REIDOUT with Joy Reid starts now. Hi, Joy.\n\nJOY REID, MSNBC HOST: How are you doing, Ari. It's accurate. It is a moment, it is a movement and it's also a vibe. It's all accurate. Thank you very much. All right, have a great evening.\n\nMELBER: You too.\n\nREID: All right. Good evening, everyone. We have a lot to get to tonight, including stunning new details from a Washington Post investigation of the January 6th insurrection.\n\nPlus, we are just hours away from polls opening in Virginia, and Glenn Youngkin continues to fear-monger about critical race theory coming for your children.\n\nBut we begin THE REIDOUT tonight with the looming threat to abortion rights in America. Today was the first hit in what could ultimately be a one-two punch during this Supreme Court term, as the right-wing dominated high court heard challenges to the nation's most restrictive abortion law in Texas.\n\nThe justices heard two challenges to the Texas law known as SR-8, effectively banning abortion after six weeks. The plaintiffs argue the law has a chilling effect on abortion providers and putting it in the hands of private citizens and deputizing them as bounty hunters, the law allows the state to evade review by the course. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out the law seemed designed to do just that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, SUPREME COURT (voice over): The fact that after oh these many years, some geniuses came up with a way to evade the commands of that decision as well as the command that the broader -- the even broader principle states are not to nullify federal constitutional rights, and to say, oh, we've never seen this before so we can't do anything about it. I guess I just don't understand the argument.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: Justices heard arguments on behalf of Texas abortion providers and the Biden administration. And with respect to the abortion providers' arguments, the justices seemed skeptical about the way the law is written, including two of the court's most openly anti-abortion members, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT, SUPREME COURT (voice over): Even apart from these procedural requirements that you're talking about, I'm wondering if, in a defensive posture in state court, the constitutional defense can be fully aired.\n\nJUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT (voice over): Justice Kagan points out there is a loophole that's been exploited here, or used here, which is the private suits are enforced by state court clerks or judges. So, the question becomes should we extend the principal of Ex Parte Young to, in essence, close that loophole.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: But before you breathe any sighs of relief, consider two things. Number one, the court's right-wing majority allowed the Texas law to remain in effect while court considers these challenges. Meaning, Texas continues to be America's very own Gilead from The Handmaid's Tale. And number two, this is just a precursor to the second punch later this year, another abortion case coming down the road with even greater consequences.\n\nExactly one month from now on December 1st, the Supreme Court will hear arguments and challenge to Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. That case is designed to take direct aim at Roe v. Wade. Mississippi wants the court to overrule its 1992 decision in Casey that says that states cannot impose an undue burden on the right to abortion before viability. As of now, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 12 states have laws as 12 that would be triggered if the court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, immediately banning all or nearly all abortions.\n\nBut abortion rights is just one of the ways that this is shaping up to be a blockbuster term for the court. In two days, the justices will hear a challenge to a New York law imposing limits on carrying guns outside the home. It's the court's first Second Amendment case in more than a decade.\n\nAnd joining me now is Marc Hearron, Senior Counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights who represented Texas abortion clinics and providers who were challenging the Texas law at the Supreme Court today, Maya Wiley, MSNBC Legal Analyst, and Elie Mystal, Justice Correspondent for The Nation. Thank you all for being here.\n\nMr. Hearron, I want to go to you first. Surprisingly, it seems like there is a little bit agreement across the right to left isle on the court. Did you get the sense that the justices' unbalance, most of them were skeptical of the Texas law.\n\nMARC HEARRON, SENIOR COUNSEL, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: Well, Joy, thanks for having. I think, finally, we're getting some justices and is heartening to hear that we're getting the argument that we've been making all along, which although SB-8 is about abortion, it has stopped the provision of abortion here 62 days across the state of Texas right now.\n\nThis case is really when you take a step back and look at it from a broader standpoint, it's whether a state can just decide I'm going to ignore Supreme Court decision.\n\n[19:05:05]\n\nThe Supreme Court decision recognizes a constitutional right can be -- become a dead letter in my state and a state can just allow, you know, anybody and everybody to sue for $10,000, $1 million in Chief Justice Roberts' questions.\n\nAnd it's heartening to hear that finally some justices are recognizing that it's -- you know, abortions at stake but tomorrow it could be every other single right that's recognized in the bill of rights that's at stake if a state can simply decide, you know, Supreme Court decisions don't carry any weight in our state anymore.\n\nREID: Yes. You know, Maya, I mean, what good is having a right if you're too afraid to use it, right? I mean, the purpose of this law was to make people too afraid to assist anyone to attempt to get an abortion themselves and just to sort of frighten abortion away, right, and make it so that it was impossible to really use the right. Do you get the sense that the fact that the Supreme Court allowed the law to be implemented while they make the decision indicates anything about where you think they might go?\n\nMAYA WILEY, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's a big concern because, as you said, Joy, where there is no remedy, as we say as lawyers, there is no right. And so if you essentially say, we're going to allow a law to stand, that is patently and obviously and clearly and explicitly about making it too scary for providers to actually deliver the services that women are constitutionally allowed to get under existing law, that that -- but you can't come to court. You essentially can't come to the Supreme Court. You can't come and get it vindicated and we won't stop the case.\n\nAnd in order to make the decision about whether or not you can, that was a huge, huge concern to all of us. I think your point is right that, you know, it is important to see the two justices are changing their minds so that maybe that meant they truly were kind of tied up in these procedural arguments about what it meant and whether or not they can step in and who would you actually say no you can't do that.\n\nBut, you know, I think the problem with the entire argument from my standpoint was the fact that because it's controversial, because we're talking about whether Casey is going to remain the law of the land, the basis that the Supreme Court said, if you just make it too hard to get an abortion, you already violated the constitutional rights of women, that you've essentially said, well, okay, we've made it so hard, in fact, we know it's so hard because 85 percent of women now can't get one. It has worked and we're not having any conversation about that. And on December 1, we're going to decide whether Casey is still the law of the land.\n\nREID: You know, and, Elie, it seems like the court sort of treated this law like they treated death penalty. You know, like the person has got to die and the way they treated voting rights, like, I guess if we make it too hard for people to vote, oh, well, sorry for you, like that seems to be kind of the way that they're operating.\n\nBut there was this sort of argument. I'm not going to play it. But just Kavanaugh, good ol' Kavanaugh, suggesting that maybe one way they might turn against the law is that they fear the law might be retrofitted to be used against guns. That was kind of the argument he made. He's like maybe we better hold our horses before they come for the guns with the same kind of strategy. What did you make of the arguments today?\n\nELIE MYSTAL, JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, THE NATION: We got Kavanaugh, I believe, because he did not understand how the uterus works but he understands how guns work. And people were able to make the case to him, that the same thing that people are using against these uteruses, that he doesn't understand, they can use against the gun and made Kavanaugh stood up and say, wait a minute now, we can't have that.\n\nLook, I don't want to be the spit in the punch bowl. This was generally good. I do think Coney Barrett and Kavanaugh will eventually overturn SB-8 but that's because SB-8 is bonkers. Like SB-8 has always been this clown side show of a crazy rule that was never going to stand the test of time because, as we've expressed, you can't have a society if people can just overturn constitutional principles as they want by hiring bounty hunters. SB-8 was never the way that they were going to overturn abortion (INAUDIBLE) on women's health.\n\nThe December 1st case was always their preferred way of taking away rights and I've heard nothing today to suggest the people that Donald Trump appointed, that he promised would be anti-abortion. I heard nothing today to suggest that they have changed their minds in any significant way about the overall rights of a woman to choose.\n\nThis bonkers SB-8 argument, yes, I think that will eventually go down, although not today. Because let's not forget the other part of what happened today was a question about whether or not they will overturn SB-8 now or wait six months to do it and I don't know that there was a lot of movement in terms of stopping it right now.\n\n[19:10:03]\n\nBut, eventually, SB-8 will go away. It is the larger issue about a women's right to choose that it's still very much on the top of mind.\n\nREID: Right. I mean, Mr. Hearron, here are some of the greater reports that abortions fell by half in the first month of this abortion ban, 50 percent fewer. The law is already having the intended effect. So, it's hard to imagine that no matter how this goes, the ultimate ruling, that, you know, conservatives aren't just going to step on the gas and try another sort of similarly clever means of getting what they want.\n\nHEARRON: Yes. I mean, this year, this legislative year has been the worst year in history for abortion rights that state legislatures are emboldened passing restriction after restriction after restriction, making abortion access harder and harder to reach. And what's happening when you see happening right now in the state of Texas, it's not only that people are being denied their right to access abortion but now because there is such a rush to get access outside of the state of Texas, it's affecting patients outside of the state of Texas in Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nPeople are being delayed by weeks because of the Texas law. 10 percent of people of reproductive age live in Texas. And so this is a crisis and it's time. It is way past time. This law has been in effect for two months. People have been denied their constitutional rights for two months. It is past time we need this law to be blocked and it needs to be blocked immediately.\n\nAnd the other thing I want to point out, you know, I heard something I thought incredibly remarkable today. The state of Texas actually said to the Supreme Court that after Brown versus the Board of Education, if a state had just passed a law like SB-8 to say, you know, anybody can sue somebody who integrates a school and federal courts can do nothing about it.\n\nThat is not the kind of constitutional democracy that we live in. This is - - that is not our republic and that cannot be -- you know, that's not the rule of law. The federal courts have got to be able to weigh in here.\n\nREID: That's exactly -- you know, nightmare with me for a minute. Because -- right, once the right has found this technique, they could use it in almost anything, whether they want to go after voting rights or integrated schools. Pretty much, you'll be able to sue anybody but a police officer that killed a family member.\n\nWILEY: Well, that's exactly right and, you know, Justice Breyer made that point. He said, so if we were in 1957 Alabama, you know, we and we had a state that said, you know what, we the state won't stop little black children from integrating white schools, we'll just deputize our residents to sue anybody who walks through that door, isn't that what you're saying? And that just put the pin in it, I think, quite directly.\n\nEven if the Texas law gave people $1 million for suing people to block their constitutional rights even when they are not harmed in any way, let's be clear, anybody, any stranger off the street can say, oh, hey, I'd love to make $10,000 and I won't even have to pay any lawyers because I'll get my legal fees. I'm going to court. I mean, that is the kind of constitutional lawlessness that we fought a civil war over and I say that because what we were hearing from Texas today was state's rights (ph), plain and simple, there is a republic, there is no federal -- there is constitutional. No one can tell us what to do.\n\nREID: And it feels, Elie, like that's where this is going. The South Africa model feels like it's fully in effect. And regardless of how they rule in this particular law, I feel like this Supreme Court, the majority of them anyway, are down with that future.\n\nMYSTAL: I mean, let's -- again, let's look at, really, the full scope of what they were arguing today. There was an actual argument from Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito, arguing that the move to control women's bodies in this way was no different than the move to force masks on people during a pandemic, like they've actually made a one-to-one connection between mask mandates and taking away abortion rights. So, that's at least, you know, two or three justices on the court are all the way over to the right in terms of their crazy and nothing seems to be happening to pull them back to the center.\n\nThis is a generational problem that we have that has come about because we let Mitch McConnell steal a couple of Supreme Court seats and now we have to deal with this for a generation unless Democrats do something to reform the court.\n\nREID: And, once again, it brings us right back to the reform of the court argument because, you're right, it's the only way out of this nightmare.\n\n[19:15:00]\n\nMarc Hearron, Maya Wiley, Elie Mystal, thank you all very much.\n\nUp next on THE REIDOUT, the plot to overthrow democracy, new details on the warnings of violence leading up to January 6th and the pressure placed on Mike Pence to, quote, show courage and spine to keep Trump in office.\n\nAlso, down to the wire in Virginia, the test of whether the Republicans' racist lies about critical race theory, which is not taught in any Virginia school, is actually a winning message for the party of Trump.\n\nPlus, the widow of a slain pastor of Charleston's Mother Emanuel AME Church joins me on the landmark settlement with the Department of Justice.\n\nAnd tonight's absolute worst, the alarming lack of urgency as the world literally burns.\n\nTHE REIDOUT continues after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nREID: NBC News today reports that the select committee on January 6th is expected to subpoena John Eastman, the legal architect of Trump's attempted coup, by the middle of this week.\n\n[19:20:02]\n\nIt comes after \"The Washington Post\" reported that Eastman e-mailed Vice President Mike Pence's team during the insurrection, while Pence was hiding from the mob that was out to kill him. And, unbelievably, Eastman blamed the violence on Pence his refusal to overturn the election.\n\nHe wrote a top Pence aide, saying: \"This siege is because you and your boss did not do what was necessary.\"\n\nYesterday, \"The Washington Post\" also released a comprehensive investigative report on the genesis and aftermath of the insurrection, and uncovered a cascade of previously undisclosed warnings that preceded the attack, noting that Trump was the driving force at every turn.\n\nAmong other things, \"The Post\" points out that, as early as September 26 of last year, Trump was aware that Congress could play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the election.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want to go back to Congress either, even though we have an advantage if we go back to Congress. Does everyone understand that?\n\nI think it's 26 to 22 or something, because it's counted one vote per state.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: It was just three days later that Trump during a presidential debate ominously told the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by.\n\nBut it wasn't just right-wing militias that answered his call to arms. As \"The Post\" reports, researchers watched how Trump's election lies radicalized his supporters in real time. And when Trump turned his focus to the joint session of Congress on January 6, the volume of threatening messages expanded by the hour.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the nation's regional homeland security offices were blinking red. The hour, date and location of concern was the same, 1:00 p.m., the U.S. Capitol, January 6. One DHS official even called D.C.'s Health Department and urged them to prepare for a mass casualty event.\n\nTo sum it up, it's damning new evidence of the security failures that day. But, moreover, it highlights the undeniable fact that Trump was responsible for the violence that unfolded. And yet, for 187 minutes, as his followers laid siege to the Capitol, Trump did nothing.\n\nIn fact, he even -- he didn't even report to the Oval Office. He was holed up instead in his private dining room as the crisis played out.\n\nJoining me now is Olivia Troye, former senior aide to Vice President Pence and director of the Republican Accountability Project.\n\nAnd, Olivia, there was lots and lots in this very lengthy \"Washington Post\" report, including reports that Senator Lindsey Graham yelled at the sergeant of arms: \"What are you doing? Take back the Senate. You have got guns. Use them.\" He wanted them to start shooting at these insurrectionists.\n\nWhat do you take away from this sort of accumulation of information, the fact that there were all of these blinking red warnings that were just not listened to, quite frankly, all the way -- all the way through Donald Trump's absence, I guess, is another way to -- the only way to put it, sort of AWOL status that day?\n\nOLIVIA TROYE, FORMER U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIAL: I think it's incredulous, looking at the reporting, the in-depth-ness of this situation, and just contrasting that with the behavior of current Republican leaders today, where they continue to try to memory hole this.\n\nI mean, this is just so striking, right, 187 minutes, where the president of the United States at the time sat, watched the Capitol be attacked, watched lives, people get hurt, lives lost, watched leaders of our country fear for their lives and just sat there and did nothing.\n\nAnd this is a man who still holds the Republicans hostage today. They still bow down to him. They still kiss the ring. There are many candidates out there who refused to denounce him. There are candidates out there that are seeking his endorsement, as we go forward to elections.\n\nAnd so, when I look at this, I think that is what you're subscribing to, this type of individual who, on the darkest day of our country on that day, did absolutely nothing for our country, to protect it, to protect our democracy. And this is the person, this is the person that everyone's rallying around. This is the person that Youngkin still hasn't denounced him. We have an election tomorrow.\n\nAnd, by the way, some of these people who were organizing this rally, they're tweeting out today about the elections that are taking place tomorrow. They are already tweeting out conspiracies and lies about it. And we have seen what that leads to. We have seen the type of violence that that can lead to, when they push these lies.\n\nAnd that is what I have fear is, going forward, what this all means. We have seen all this play out. So we can't move on from this, because it matters so much. It matters so much for the future.\n\nAnd as I read this, that's all that kept going through my head and just -- it's just so astounding to think about this, the greater picture.\n\nREID: And, just as a contrast, I mean, you have Donald Trump trying to hide documents, trying to keep the select committee from finding out documents.\n\nAnd when you read through this piece in \"The Washington Post,\" you kind of understand why, because even before for the election happened, he was saying, hey, maybe we could use Congress as a way to -- regardless of how things go to keep me in office, all the way through watching it happen.\n\n[19:25:10]\n\nIt does feel that, at every turn, Donald Trump was the person who was goading, pushing, and inspiring people to commit violence, anything to stay in power. It's hard to get around that, no?\n\nTROYE: Absolutely.\n\nHe was the commander in chief of this entire insurrection. He incited it. And, look, when you're the president, words matter. When you're a leader, words matter. And seeing the reporting about the followers and supporters saying that he's -- it's a call to action, he's called them to action, he didn't tell them to bring the guns because he can't actually say it, but he's telling them to bring the guns, that's how they're interpreting this.\n\nThey're interpreting this message. And so a lot of these people use this as a double entendre when they speak. We were watching elected officials, when they speak with such violence, when they put violence in their -- in their -- the ads on social media right now. All of that matters because it's processed by and supported by the people that follow them.\n\nAnd they take that in. And from a national security standpoint, this is all remains just very concerning.\n\nREID: Let's play a tale of two Republicans here. This is Matt Gaetz yesterday, who we should remind folks is being investigated for potential trafficking of a 17-year-old girl, but is not embarrassed at all. He's still out there talking.\n\nHere he is saying that he thinks that he'd like to see the metal detectors at the Capitol blown up.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I said, man, is it Tannerite or C4 we want to put in those metal detectors when we blow them up?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: Tannerite is basically like C4.\n\nI mean, this feels like fifth column activity inside the Republican Party. You have something called the Republican Accountability Project. You're a former Republican that is now fighting what used to be your party. It does feel like they're all insurrection, race-scaremongering, and really gearing up to never accept the results of an election unless one of them wins it.\n\nTROYE: This is who they are. There's no room for the truth.\n\nThat's why you see people like Adam Kinzinger saying that he's going to continue to uphold the fight and fight from outside now. He's not a part of this anymore. There's no room for people like Liz Cheney right now. Look at the way they have treated her.\n\nSo this is the Republican Party. And anyone who is thinking otherwise is delusional. They're not living in reality. And so I am concerned about going forward what this means for our future as a country to have a party like this that continues to behave in this manner, because it's fundamentally just dangerous.\n\nAnd I think we have one functioning party right now. And I think we have to do everything we can to sort of support people who are rational, people who are actually trying to govern and push policies that make a difference in our country.\n\nREID: It's a scary time.\n\nWe say scaring is caring a lot on this show, but there's no way around it. It is pretty frightening to have that element inside of one of our formerly great Republican -- great political parties in America.\n\nOlivia Troye, thank you very much. Really appreciate you.\n\nAll right, still ahead: It is election eve, as you just heard, and candidates are making their final pitches to voters. In the Virginia governor's race, that means Republican Glenn Trumpkin is misquoting Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his bid to put racial division and culture wars front and center.\n\nThe latest next. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[19:32:53]\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGLENN YOUNGKIN (R), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: In the immortal words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we're called to judge one another based on the content of our character and not the color of our skin.\n\nAnd that's why there's no place for Critical Race Theory in our school system and why, on day one, I'm going to ban it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: Literally the only quote they know.\n\nGlenn Youngkin's closing argument to Virginia voters included the latest form of Republican gaslighting, pimping the one Martin Luther King Jr. quote that they can remember, while vowing to erase everything Dr. King stood for from the history books.\n\nJoining me now, Don Calloway, Democratic strategist and founder of the National Voter Protection Action Fund, and Charlie Sykes, editor at large of The Bulwark.\n\nThis is the closing argument. Obviously, this is the way they want to go.\n\nAnd, Don, the reason that this kind of works is that they don't really have to make an argument about what's actually in the schools. They can just get people to feel a certain way. And it's the feeling -- Republicans are really good at running on just feelings, not policy.\n\nDON CALLOWAY, FOUNDER, NATIONAL VOTER PROTECTION ACTION FUND: Yes.\n\nREID: But just: This feels weird to me. I don't like it. And therefore, I'm going to vote Republican.\n\nI want to play -- this is a thing called The Good Liars. They're like a comedy troupe, I guess a comedy sort of video kind of -- I don't know what they are, actually. They are like -- they do comedy, but they go out and they interview people, and they do sort of real-world interviews.\n\nHere they are interviewing someone in Virginia, one of them.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is Critical Race Theory?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm not going to get into the specifics of it, because I don't understand it that much. But it's something that I don't -- what little bit that I know, I don't care for.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what have you heard that you don't like?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm not going to -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't have that much knowledge on it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: And just for context, Don, the actual original question was, what's the most important issue in this race? And the gentleman said Critical Race Theory.\n\nSo, Republicans have managed to turn this thing that -- I call it Christopher Rufo theory. You can call whatever you want. They made up a thing that feel -- that makes people feel a certain way. And so far it's working for them in a certain level, right?\n\nCALLOWAY: It is. It is.\n\nWell, first of all, to Glenn Youngkin's despicable twisting of Dr. King's words, actually, he says them -- not twist them, but he says them out of context. As my brother the great Reverend Dr. Starsky Wilson says, we should never allow ourselves to be disavowed of the notion of a radically- justice-based Dr. King.\n\n[19:35:17]\n\nAnd that's ultimately who he was. That's ultimately why he was killed. We should never allow ourselves to forget that.\n\nBut Critical Race Theory is -- I mean, and we have seen it evolve into this discussion of parental rights or parents' rights in the school context. They're ultimately talking about Critical Race Theory as an avatar for white fragility and white rights, right, to not have to acknowledge systemic racism, to not have to even teach in schools on the history of white supremacy and how it's baked into the fabric of this country.\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, particularly unfortunately for Terry McAuliffe, he has allowed Glenn Youngkin, to grab onto this sliver, this minor shade of truth, and run it for the last 60 days of this campaign, because of a perhaps less-than-careful moment that Terry McAuliffe had in a primary and -- excuse me -- in the primary debates.\n\nAnd it's gotten this far, and we hope that he's not able to take advantage of low Democratic turnout and a sleepy electorate to run it this far.\n\nBut, to be clear, this discussion of parental rights, ultimately, this discussion of Critical Race Theory is not only a gross misunderstanding of what the academic definition and the academic discipline, Derrick Bell's academic discipline of Critical Race Theory is, but it is an intentional misconstruing, which has misled these fundamentally kind of white male rural voters into believing that angry Malcolmian black supremacists are going to take over public schools. And it's not.\n\nUnfortunately -- and I will end with this -- Republican strategists know that. But they know how to tap into that deep ethereal white fragility. And it's so sad that it's working five miles from where I live.\n\nREID: And, Charlie, I think that the twisting of Dr. King actually demonstrates how Republicans have done this so well.\n\nThey have taken somebody who was absolutely despised and thought of as a radical and dangerous communist when he was alive, and they have turned him into a greeting card that says, nobody's ever bad, nothing's ever bad, everything is fine. Everyone just -- we just need to all talk about how good everyone is.\n\nThey have taken his whole career and distilled it down to that one quote that they can remember, content of our character. And they don't understand anything about Dr. King, just like they don't under -- you know what I mean? You don't have to know anything about Dr. King.\n\nYou just have to memorize that one line. And then everything that makes you feel like anybody white is -- that you're saying that white people weren't like great all throughout history, ah, ah, ah, I will throw King at you.\n\nAnd I think they have done that really well with a lot of these issues. It's just a feelings-based kind of strategy. But I'm not sure that Democrats have ever figured out -- whether it was Reagan doing it with welfare, whether it's now, I'm not sure Democrats have figured out how to respond to it.\n\nCHARLIE SYKES, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: No, and we're going to find that out tomorrow in Virginia.\n\nYou mentioned the name Christopher Rufo. And I just kind of wanted to put a pin in all of that, because, of course, he is one of the theorists and the activists who's been pushing this.\n\nAnd then he's been very, very transparent about his agenda that he wants people to pay -- I think he actually tweeted out that he wants people to pick up the newspaper and see something that makes them uncomfortable and immediately think Critical Race Theory.\n\nREID: That's right.\n\nSYKES: So anything involving race that they do not understand or that they might find questionable, you have labeled a Critical Race Theory.\n\nAnd I'm glad you played that clip, because I was actually going to mention that clip. You could have that same interview with legislators all around the country who are voting to ban Critical Race Theory.\n\nREID: That's right.\n\nSYKES: What exactly is Critical Race Theory? Could you show me an example of Critical Race Theory in any public school in your state?\n\nIn Wisconsin, the Republican legislature has not only passed a ban on Critical Race Theory. They have actually come up with a list of words that are actually banned that you cannot use, terms like multiculturalism and social justice.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nSYKES: So, it would be interesting if somebody would have gone back at Mr. Youngkin and said, you're quoting Martin Luther King Jr., but you're going to ban what you call Critical Race Theory.\n\nUnder your ban, would you actually be able to teach about Martin Luther King?\n\nREID: You would not.\n\nSYKES: Would you be able to have a curriculum that would include his letters from the jail...\n\nREID: You could not.\n\nSYKES: ... or the entire speech, rather than just the excerpt?\n\nBecause I'm guessing that somebody is going to stand up and say, well, that makes me feel uncomfortable. This must be Critical Race Theory.\n\nREID: Exactly.\n\nAnd, I mean, the thing is, he gave speeches about America may go to hell. You -- probably, you cannot teach that, because so -- and I want to stay with it just for a moment, because I do think -- I want to stay with you for a second, Charlie.\n\nThe Tomahawk Chop, can we show this? Trump did it at the Major League Baseball game, at the World Series game. He and his wife did it. The governor of Georgia did it. They're all participating in this. It's the same kind of thing.\n\n[19:40:06]\n\nThere is this sense among some white Americans, not all, but some, that you don't -- that they aren't allowed to do or say what they want because some minority group is going to be offended. And it is that. That's what Critical Race Theory is to them, that I don't get to say the jokes I want to say, say the memes I want to say, do the Tomahawk Chop. People get mad? And I don't like that.\n\nThat is what they're legislating against, no?\n\nSYKES: Right.\n\nAnd they like that sort of transgressive behavior. We have to point that Major League Baseball...\n\nREID: They do. They like offending people.\n\nSYKES: Yes.\n\nRemember when Major League Baseball actually boycotted the state of Georgia because of its restrictive voting law? And, of course, Major League Baseball is there -- is back in a big way with the World Series, and they invite Donald Trump to come and do the Tomahawk Chop, so speaking of hypocrisy.\n\nBut you're absolutely right. I mean, what someone like Donald Trump does is, he gives permission to people to engage in behavior...\n\nREID: Yes, be your worst self.\n\nSYKES: ... that maybe we were at the point of questioning.\n\nREID: That's right.\n\nSYKES: And so I do think that you need to see this in the context of a new white backlash, the kind of thing that we saw, as you have pointed out on this show over and over again, of Reconstruction.\n\nREID: Yes. Yes.\n\nSYKES: And this is basically just the fill-in for the term that they use to provide them the context.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nREID: Absolutely. And they don't want to be reconstructed. They say, I want to be my worst self, and I want you to accept it, and I don't care. That's what they want. And that to them is what Critical Race Theory means.\n\nDon Calloway, Charlie Sykes, thank you all very much.\n\nUp next: a historic settlement in the 2015 massacre of the Mother -- at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[19:45:47]\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJENNIFER PINCKNEY, WIDOW OF REVEREND CLEMENTA PINCKNEY: I still relive and I still think about what happened being there.\n\nI will remember it until the day I die. And so I live with it every day. Yes, there is a settlement. And I don't think about that. I think about, if I had the opportunity to bring Clementa back, I'd switch. You can all take the settlement. Bring my husband back me. Bring their father back to them.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: It's been more than six years since nine people were shot and killed in the horrific massacre at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nAfter it was revealed that the FBI's background check system failed to catch a previous felony drug arrest that should have blocked the sale of the gun that was used by the 21-year-old white supremacist, the families of the victims sued.\n\nOn Thursday, the Justice Department announced an $88 million settlement with the families of the victims and survivors. One of the attorneys for the victims calls it one of the largest settlements in a collection of civil rights cases in the nation's history.\n\nAnd joining me now is Jennifer Pinckney, who survived the shooting and is the widow of the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, also the family's attorney, Gerald Malloy, who's a South Carolina state senator who served with Reverend Pinckney.\n\nThank you both for being here.\n\nPINCKNEY: Thank you.\n\nSo we just saw a clip of you saying you would throw the settlement aside and have your husband back.\n\nAnd I hate to take you back to this day. But you were there. You are not just widow of a victim. You, yourself, were a victim. You and your daughter were there.\n\nPINCKNEY: Yes.\n\nREID: So this is really big for you.\n\nPINCKNEY: It is. It is.\n\nWe were there. And it's something that I will always remember for the rest of my life, sitting in the office, and the bullets coming through, and trying to protect my daughter. It was something that I will always remember for the rest of my life.\n\nREID: She was a little girl. She was -- I think she was, what, 12, 11? She was 11 years old.\n\nPINCKNEY: She was 6.\n\nREID: She was 6 years old. She's 11 now.\n\nPINCKNEY: She's 12 now.\n\nREID: Does she talk about it at all?\n\nPINCKNEY: No, she doesn't. She doesn't.\n\nNow, with both of my girls, they will -- we will talk about their father and daddy this, daddy that, and just spring up different things he used to say and do and so forth. But as far as just her bringing up that particular day, no, she doesn't.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nAnd, Senator, you served with Clementa Pinckney. You talked about his last words...\n\nSTATE SEN. GERALD MALLOY (D-SC): Yes, well...\n\nREID: ... on the Senate floor.\n\nMALLOY: On the Senate floor, where Clementa had gave a wonderful speech on body cameras.\n\nAnd what he did was to say -- it was after the murder of Walter Scott. And then, in the end, he said: God teaches us to love all of it. And, in the end, justice will be done.\n\nAnd that's one of the best speeches you would ever hear from the Senate floor, and it was somewhat prophetic. Clementa was an absolute terrific person. He called himself an itinerant pastor. Any time that there was something going on with the church or a church member, and there was something in the Senate, he was a pastor first.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nAnd when you -- when I think about those, those final words, Mrs. Pinckney, I remember a pastor, not from South Carolina, saying to me black folks are always expected to have amazing grace. No matter what we suffer, no matter how much we're hurting, we're supposed to have grace.\n\nAnd I remember a lot of media people asking the victims of the Charleston nine, the family members, do you forgive?\n\nBut I want to ask you if you -- if you're still angry. I mean, the state of South Carolina obviously failed you. This court has now said they failed you. Are you still angry about that?\n\nPINCKNEY: You can't be angry.\n\nThat's something that, if you hold that in, you can't move forward.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nPINCKNEY: And so you have to be able to -- you never forget. You will always remember.\n\nAnd I will always be there to talk to my girls and tell them and other people what happened and so forth as from my standpoint. But that's something that you just never forget.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nAnd let's talk about this specific settlement, $88 million. That is significant, because, for those who are not familiar with white nationalists and white supremacists, they use 88 for heil Hitler. That is their symbol.\n\n[19:50:07]\n\nAnd so that -- that's a very significant settlement amount. Talk about what that means.\n\nMALLOY: Well, on the day of the -- reaching the settlement, it really didn't cross my mind. We were trying to do the best that we could for these families, because they have suffered so much and given so much.\n\nBut during the evaluation, what we have is that we have a civil case. We had been in mediation for the better part of two days jockeying back and forth. It wasn't easy. And so then, at the very end, when we got to a point and say, this is the number, then someone says, there's somebody else's hands that's touching. This is the hands of God.\n\nThere's something going on here, because, in the end, not to be cute about it, would you have taken 100 instead? Of course. But what happened was is that that was the number. And we had a discussion about it. And then the question was, he said, do we need to change it from $1 off or $1 less, $1 more or something?\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: And then someone said, you know what, let's take it back. Let's make that number mean something.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: When it meant something to someone else, when they use it as a racist symbol, let's take it back and make it a symbol of pride.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: This is something that -- where we were trying to right a wrong.\n\nAnd hats off to Attorney General Merrick Garland for his compassion, for his emphasis on civil rights, and all the work of all the lawyers that were involved on both sides. Vanita Gupta was tremendous in this work. We had Bakari Sellers that came in to help broker part of the deal. Had some wonderful lawyers like Alvin Hammer and Mullins McLeod others that worked really hard on this case.\n\nSo it was a come-togetherness at that time. So that number came in. And, right now, that number means something else to us...\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: ... than the number of bullets that Dylann Roof into the church, 88 bullets. He used 77 and seven magazines. The 88 that he inscribed on his shoe.\n\nAnd so it meant something to him. This will mean something else for others, is that this is a just result.\n\nREID: And, Mrs. Pinckney, you had a chance to meet with the attorney general. Would you share with us some of what he said to the families?\n\nPINCKNEY: He was just very compassionate.\n\nIt almost looked like he had tears in his eyes. I mean, he was like: I know this doesn't bring your family member back. But it was something that we had to do.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nWell, I want to just say that we have deepest condolences to your family, you and your girls for your loss.\n\nAnd I want to congratulate you all, as the attorneys who made this settlement happen. This is justice, in a way. As you said, it's not going to bring back your loved ones.\n\nBut, Jennifer Pinckney, state Senator Gerald Malloy, thank you both very much.\n\nPINCKNEY: Thank you.\n\nREID: Really appreciate you both.\n\nMALLOY: Thank you.\n\nREID: All right, and don't go anywhere.\n\nTonight's \"Absolute Worst\" affects every single person on this planet. And we are quickly running out of time to do something about it.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[19:57:18]\n\nREID: While we are sitting here right now, the planet we live on is dying.\n\nThis year, the U.S. has seen 18 weather disasters that have killed more than 500 people, costing taxpayers more than a billion dollars. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which studies this stuff, nearly half the country has been subjected to a devastating climate event.\n\nThere have been forest fires in California and Nevada, extreme droughts in California, Oregon, Utah, Montana, and North Dakota, severe weather in Texas and Oklahoma, flooding in Louisiana, which gutted thousands of homes, devastating tornadoes in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, tropical storms up and down the Eastern Seaboard that left Florida homes bombarded and New York City subway stations submerged, which, needless to say, is not supposed to happen.\n\nAnd that's just what's happening here in the U.S. Around the world, the number of climate-related disasters has tripled in the last 50 years, tripled. Extraordinarily hot and cold temperatures are responsible for five million deaths every year. That's about how many people have died around the world from COVID.\n\nClimate collapse is taking the equivalent number of lives every single year. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that warned us that, if humans don't get their acts together and drastically -- and I mean drastically -- cut carbon emissions in the next 12 years, we will have irreversibly worse droughts, flooding, extreme heat and climate-induced poverty.\n\nThat was three years ago. And even with current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we're on track to see temperatures rise by nearly 3 degrees Celsius this century. In layman's terms, this Earth could eventually become unlivable.\n\nToday, world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP 26 climate summit, where delegates called for accelerated action.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.\n\nBORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The longer we fail to act, the worse it gets, and the higher the price when we are eventually forced by catastrophe to act.\n\nMIA MOTTLEY, PRIME MINISTER OF BARBADOS: We act in the interest of all of our people, who are dependent on us. And if we don't, we will allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: President Biden, who's trying to reverse the damage done by his predecessor and the Republican Party, made an appeal of his own.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases.\n\nGod bless you all, and may God save the planet.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: I'm glad he said that, because it's going to take a miracle to turn this planet around.\n\nSo, tonight, the lack of global outrage and action when it comes to the demise of the only planet we have got is the \"Absolute Worst.\"\n\nAnd that's tonight's REIDOUT.\n\n\"ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES\" starts now.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

For thousands of years nobody cared what youth were doing. They weren't news. They were minding. They aren't minding now. That isn't news. They haven't been minding since the days of...F. Scott Fitzgerald. In those days, they were cutting loose. In the thirties, they were joining up.... During the McCarthy Epoch and the Korean War, they were turning their backs and walking away. Today they are striking back. That is news. Nobody else is striking back. -Kenneth Rexroth, July 2, 1960 Two Cheers for Kennedy Vice President Nixon defends the record of the Administration in implementing cold-war policies and says he would do better; Senator Kennedy says he could do a lot, lot better.... ...Both are opposed to the recognition of China;...neither has suggested that the Congressional inquisitorial committees should be curbed or abolished; neither acknowledges the existence of civil liberties as an issue. On civil rights...the Democratic nominee enjoy[s] a margin of preference.... Still a dilemma remains. New Nixon or old,...his consistent policy has been: never meet debate if you can stifle it....

The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\nIn talking about the Revolt of Youth we should never forget that we are dealing with a new concept. For thousands of years nobody cared what youth were doing. They weren't news. They were minding. They aren't minding now. That isn't news. They haven't been minding since the days of...F. Scott Fitzgerald. In those days, they were cutting loose. In the thirties, they were joining up.... During the McCarthy Epoch and the Korean War, they were turning their backs and walking away. Today they are striking back. That is news. Nobody else is striking back. -Kenneth Rexroth, July 2, 1960 Two Cheers for Kennedy Vice President Nixon defends the record of the Administration in implementing cold-war policies and says he would do better; Senator Kennedy says he could do a lot, lot better.... ...Both are opposed to the recognition of China;...neither has suggested that the Congressional inquisitorial committees should be curbed or abolished; neither acknowledges the existence of civil liberties as an issue. On civil rights...the Democratic nominee enjoy[s] a margin of preference.... Still a dilemma remains. New Nixon or old,...his consistent policy has been: never meet debate if you can stifle it.... In the past, his adherence to this method has not resulted in irreparable damage; in the future it might.... In the circumstances, there is only one way to cast an effective protest vote against Nixon and that is to mark a ballot for Senator Kennedy. -Editorial, October 15, 1960 That torture became passé with the Inquisition is an illusion which the Algerian war has dispelled. In that gruesome conflict, the Algerians have specialized in assassination, the French in torture. -Editorial, \"The Efficacy of Terror,\" November 12, 1960 Marilyn Monroe: 1926-1962 Marilyn Monroe was supposed to be the Sex Goddess, but somehow no one, including, or indeed first of all, herself, ever believed it.

Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital?

The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\nThey aren't minding now. That isn't news. They haven't been minding since the days of...F. Scott Fitzgerald. In those days, they were cutting loose. In the thirties, they were joining up.... During the McCarthy Epoch and the Korean War, they were turning their backs and walking away. Today they are striking back. That is news. Nobody else is striking back. -Kenneth Rexroth, July 2, 1960 Two Cheers for Kennedy Vice President Nixon defends the record of the Administration in implementing cold-war policies and says he would do better; Senator Kennedy says he could do a lot, lot better.... ...Both are opposed to the recognition of China;...neither has suggested that the Congressional inquisitorial committees should be curbed or abolished; neither acknowledges the existence of civil liberties as an issue. On civil rights...the Democratic nominee enjoy[s] a margin of preference.... Still a dilemma remains. New Nixon or old,...his consistent policy has been: never meet debate if you can stifle it.... In the past, his adherence to this method has not resulted in irreparable damage; in the future it might.... In the circumstances, there is only one way to cast an effective protest vote against Nixon and that is to mark a ballot for Senator Kennedy. -Editorial, October 15, 1960 That torture became passé with the Inquisition is an illusion which the Algerian war has dispelled. In that gruesome conflict, the Algerians have specialized in assassination, the French in torture. -Editorial, \"The Efficacy of Terror,\" November 12, 1960 Marilyn Monroe: 1926-1962 Marilyn Monroe was supposed to be the Sex Goddess, but somehow no one, including, or indeed first of all, herself, ever believed it. Rather, she was a comedienne impersonating the American idea of the Sex Goddess.... Her performances indicated that while sex is certainly fun, and often funny, it is only one of many games. Others include the use of the intelligence.

The execution of [Caryl] Chessman, however, was an act of insect-morality, carried out in a moral vacuum; it seemed to lack even the possible medieval dignity of vengeance or the possible sick strength of sadism; in terms of cultural tragedy, it felt like the last twist of the knife. -Terry Southern, May 21, 1960 America's Black Supremacists Malcolm X...speaks forcefully, yet with complete control:... \"We are seeking a return to our own culture....Where's Ralph Bunche? He isn't in Harlem. He's down at the Waldorf-Astoria. Where's Roy Wilkins? When has he given a speech in Harlem, to the people of Harlem? I'm not talking about the black bourgeoisie.\" -Herbert Krosney, May 6, 1961 Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas? The Nation was the only US publication to warn of the Bay of Pigs. Fidel Castro may have a sounder basis for his expressed fears of a U.S.-financed \"Guatemala-type\" invasion than most of us realize. On a recent visit to Guatemala, Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of the Institute of Hispanic-American Studies at Stanford University, was told the Central Intelligence Agency has acquired a large tract of land, at an outlay in excess of $1,000,000...that is being used as a training ground for Cuban counter-revolutionaries who are preparing for an eventual landing in Cuba. It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record....

On a recent visit to Guatemala, Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of the Institute of Hispanic-American Studies at Stanford University, was told the Central Intelligence Agency has acquired a large tract of land, at an outlay in excess of $1,000,000...that is being used as a training ground for Cuban counter-revolutionaries who are preparing for an eventual landing in Cuba. It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n...Both are opposed to the recognition of China;...neither has suggested that the Congressional inquisitorial committees should be curbed or abolished; neither acknowledges the existence of civil liberties as an issue. On civil rights...the Democratic nominee enjoy[s] a margin of preference.... Still a dilemma remains. New Nixon or old,...his consistent policy has been: never meet debate if you can stifle it.... In the past, his adherence to this method has not resulted in irreparable damage; in the future it might.... In the circumstances, there is only one way to cast an effective protest vote against Nixon and that is to mark a ballot for Senator Kennedy. -Editorial, October 15, 1960 That torture became passé with the Inquisition is an illusion which the Algerian war has dispelled. In that gruesome conflict, the Algerians have specialized in assassination, the French in torture. -Editorial, \"The Efficacy of Terror,\" November 12, 1960 Marilyn Monroe: 1926-1962 Marilyn Monroe was supposed to be the Sex Goddess, but somehow no one, including, or indeed first of all, herself, ever believed it. Rather, she was a comedienne impersonating the American idea of the Sex Goddess.... Her performances indicated that while sex is certainly fun, and often funny, it is only one of many games. Others include the use of the intelligence.

The execution of [Caryl] Chessman, however, was an act of insect-morality, carried out in a moral vacuum; it seemed to lack even the possible medieval dignity of vengeance or the possible sick strength of sadism; in terms of cultural tragedy, it felt like the last twist of the knife. -Terry Southern, May 21, 1960 America's Black Supremacists Malcolm X...speaks forcefully, yet with complete control:... \"We are seeking a return to our own culture....Where's Ralph Bunche?

These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\nStill a dilemma remains. New Nixon or old,...his consistent policy has been: never meet debate if you can stifle it.... In the past, his adherence to this method has not resulted in irreparable damage; in the future it might.... In the circumstances, there is only one way to cast an effective protest vote against Nixon and that is to mark a ballot for Senator Kennedy. -Editorial, October 15, 1960 That torture became passé with the Inquisition is an illusion which the Algerian war has dispelled. In that gruesome conflict, the Algerians have specialized in assassination, the French in torture. -Editorial, \"The Efficacy of Terror,\" November 12, 1960 Marilyn Monroe: 1926-1962 Marilyn Monroe was supposed to be the Sex Goddess, but somehow no one, including, or indeed first of all, herself, ever believed it. Rather, she was a comedienne impersonating the American idea of the Sex Goddess.... Her performances indicated that while sex is certainly fun, and often funny, it is only one of many games. Others include the use of the intelligence.

The execution of [Caryl] Chessman, however, was an act of insect-morality, carried out in a moral vacuum; it seemed to lack even the possible medieval dignity of vengeance or the possible sick strength of sadism; in terms of cultural tragedy, it felt like the last twist of the knife. -Terry Southern, May 21, 1960 America's Black Supremacists Malcolm X...speaks forcefully, yet with complete control:... \"We are seeking a return to our own culture....Where's Ralph Bunche? He isn't in Harlem. He's down at the Waldorf-Astoria. Where's Roy Wilkins? When has he given a speech in Harlem, to the people of Harlem? I'm not talking about the black bourgeoisie.\" -Herbert Krosney, May 6, 1961 Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas? The Nation was the only US publication to warn of the Bay of Pigs. Fidel Castro may have a sounder basis for his expressed fears of a U.S.-financed \"Guatemala-type\" invasion than most of us realize. On a recent visit to Guatemala, Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of the Institute of Hispanic-American Studies at Stanford University, was told the Central Intelligence Agency has acquired a large tract of land, at an outlay in excess of $1,000,000...that is being used as a training ground for Cuban counter-revolutionaries who are preparing for an eventual landing in Cuba. It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America.

The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools.

They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Editorial, \"The Efficacy of Terror,\" November 12, 1960\n\nMarilyn Monroe was supposed to be the Sex Goddess, but somehow no one, including, or indeed first of all, herself, ever believed it. Rather, she was a comedienne impersonating the American idea of the Sex Goddess.... Her performances indicated that while sex is certainly fun, and often funny, it is only one of many games. Others include the use of the intelligence.

The execution of [Caryl] Chessman, however, was an act of insect-morality, carried out in a moral vacuum; it seemed to lack even the possible medieval dignity of vengeance or the possible sick strength of sadism; in terms of cultural tragedy, it felt like the last twist of the knife. -Terry Southern, May 21, 1960 America's Black Supremacists Malcolm X...speaks forcefully, yet with complete control:... \"We are seeking a return to our own culture....Where's Ralph Bunche? He isn't in Harlem. He's down at the Waldorf-Astoria. Where's Roy Wilkins? When has he given a speech in Harlem, to the people of Harlem? I'm not talking about the black bourgeoisie.\" -Herbert Krosney, May 6, 1961 Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas? The Nation was the only US publication to warn of the Bay of Pigs. Fidel Castro may have a sounder basis for his expressed fears of a U.S.-financed \"Guatemala-type\" invasion than most of us realize. On a recent visit to Guatemala, Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of the Institute of Hispanic-American Studies at Stanford University, was told the Central Intelligence Agency has acquired a large tract of land, at an outlay in excess of $1,000,000...that is being used as a training ground for Cuban counter-revolutionaries who are preparing for an eventual landing in Cuba. It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here.

It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Terry Southern, May 21, 1960\n\nMalcolm X...speaks forcefully, yet with complete control:... \"We are seeking a return to our own culture....Where's Ralph Bunche?

I'm not talking about the black bourgeoisie.\" -Herbert Krosney, May 6, 1961 Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas? The Nation was the only US publication to warn of the Bay of Pigs.

On a recent visit to Guatemala, Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of the Institute of Hispanic-American Studies at Stanford University, was told the Central Intelligence Agency has acquired a large tract of land, at an outlay in excess of $1,000,000...that is being used as a training ground for Cuban counter-revolutionaries who are preparing for an eventual landing in Cuba. It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue.

The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Herbert Krosney, May 6, 1961\n\nThe Nation was the only US publication to warn of the Bay of Pigs. Fidel Castro may have a sounder basis for his expressed fears of a U.S.-financed \"Guatemala-type\" invasion than most of us realize. On a recent visit to Guatemala, Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of the Institute of Hispanic-American Studies at Stanford University, was told the Central Intelligence Agency has acquired a large tract of land, at an outlay in excess of $1,000,000...that is being used as a training ground for Cuban counter-revolutionaries who are preparing for an eventual landing in Cuba. It was also said that U.S. personnel and equipment are being used at the base. -Editorial, November 19, 1960 In the Ring Sonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality.

The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Editorial, November 19, 1960\n\nSonny Liston was the big black Negro in every white man's hallway, waiting to do him in, deal him under, for all the hurts white men have been able to inflict on his world. Sonny Liston was \"the huge Negro,\" the \"bad nigger,\" a heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world. He was the underdeveloped have-not (politically naive) backward country, the subject people, finally here to collect his pound of flesh. The mock contest between Liston and Patterson was a \"brushfire\" limited war. Neo-Colonial policy to confuse the issue. Patterson was to represent the fruit of the missionary ethic; he had found God, reversed his underprivileged (uncontrolled) violence, and turned it to work for the democratic liberal imperialist state. The tardy black Horatio Alger offering the glad hand of integration to welcome 20 million into the lunatic asylum of white America.... ...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital?

[Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n...We always get to the bad niggers...either kill 'em or drive 'em out of the country. Jack Johnson, Henry Highland Garnet, Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Robert Williams, Richard Wright, Sidney Bechet, Josephine Baker, Beauford Deloney, Chester Himes, so many others. The black neurotic beauties trailing dumbly through the \"equal\" streets of hopeless European cities. All the unclaimed fugitive corpses.... That leaves us with Cassius X. Back in the days when he was still Clay it was easy to see him as a toy manufactured by the Special Products Division of Madison Avenue.... [But] Clay is not a fake, and even his blustering and playground poetry are valid; they demonstrate that a new and more complicated generation has moved onto the scene. -LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964 Beatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers.

Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence.

It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A.

Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead....

The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-LeRoi Jones, June 29, 1964\n\nBeatlemania as a phenomenon is manna for dull minds. -Alan Rinzler, \"No Soul in Beatlesville,\" March 2, 1964 The March The March [on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]...should also establish what has been clear all along-at least to those who have had more than a nodding acquaintance with the so-called \"Negro problem\"-that the Negroes are probably the least alienated of America's racial minorities and the least revolutionary in any ideological sense. The overwhelming drive of American Negroes, in all regions, at all levels, is for middle-class status; they want to participate, on terms of freedom and equality, in the Great American Barbecue. -Editorial, September 14, 1963 Prison Notes of a Freedom Rider We could see about two inches of the faces of our immediate neighbors and quickly learned the views of the \"voices\" which made up our little world. Views there were, of all sizes, shapes and intensities. The cell block-like Sartre's No Exit -was a constant torment of argument, dogma, prayer and song.... After breakfast (grits, coffee, molasses, white bread) came devotions.... This was followed by special time set aside for debate and argument.... Votes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools?

[Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy.

They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence. He is the guy who will get the police out.... He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't. They know that marijuana is mildly pleasant and doesn't give you lung cancer. -Jack Newfield, \"One Cheer for the Hippies,\" June 26, 1967 Beale Street and Points North His movement, his life were Southern; but Memphis, where he died, symbolized more than the South. Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead.... So far twenty-eight Panther leaders have been assassinated. -Editorial, \"Marked for Extinction,\" December 22, 1969 Vietnam: This Is Guernica What is the point of attacking a leper hospital? And of doing it thirty-nine times? What have we possibly got against public education for Vietnamese children that we should seek out and destroy their schools? Was the leprosarium really a supply dump? Was the cathedral really a barracks?... Our Air Force does not simply bomb the north. Using conventional explosives, pellets, napalm, white phosphor, thermite, magnesium or rockets, depending on the mission, it bombs this or that sector of the city of Vinh because, this Thanh Hoa cathedral instead of that pagoda because , this central irrigation system instead of that Northern canal because ...because why? The ROTC manual begins to give us a sense of the answer.... Psychosocial structure .... \"The objectives of these attacks in the past have been to dispel the people's belief in the invincibility of their forces,...to cause strikes, sabotage, riots, fear, panic, hunger, and passive resistance to the government.... \"If we were to search for the single type of target whose destruction would have the greatest adverse effect on the morale of a population today, we would have to conclude that the destruction of an enemy's major cities with high yield nuclear weapons would produce the most telling results, not only on morale, but on every other component of the nation's structure.\" All this from a soldier's primer. -Carl Ogelsby, on the occasion of the Bertrand Russell International War Crimes Tribunal in Stockholm, June 5, 1967 Whitey's on the Moon Now I had a Papago Indian intellectual friend over to watch the first man on the moon. The Papago Indian intellectual brought over a Papago Indian cowboy to watch too. \"They are about to land,\" I said. \"You said something about beer.\" \"Wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Till they get on the moon.\" \"Are they on the moon yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can I have the beer?\" \"The white man on the moon said one small step for a man and one giant step for mankind.\" \"That's nice,\" the Papago cowboy said. \"Can I have the beer now?\" -William Eastlake, September 15, 1969 A Feast for Open Eyes Flaming Creatures is much more about intersexuality than about homosexuality. [Director Jack] Smith's vision is akin to the vision in Bosch's paintings of a paradise and a hell of writhing, shameless, ingenious bodies.... [T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy. The film is built out of a complex web of ambiguities and ambivalences, whose primary image is the confusion of male and female flesh. The shaken breast and the shaken penis are interchangeable with each other. -Susan Sontag, writing after the film was seized by New York City police on grounds of obscenity, April 13, 1964 After Stonewall The Nation did not comment on the Stonewall riot in 1969. The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\nVotes were necessary to settle the never-ending debates that broke out over large matters or small.... Someone in cell No. 2 on the far side makes a motion which is ponderously passed from cell to cell, to our \"pivot man\" and down the thirteen cells on our side. Assuming the motion managed this precarious passage without distortion (or objection), the debate began. Each person's remarks and interpolations had again to be passed around the block. After everyone had had his full say, the voting would begin. \"How does cell No. 4 vote?\" \"One for, one against.\" \"O.K. Cell No. 5, what about you?\" \"Two abstentions. We want to explain our abstentions.\" A series of low groans would break out. This democratic spirit was doggedly defended to the very end. -Robert Martinson, January 6, 1962 'Let Justice Roll Down' With the maturation of the civil rights movement, growing out of the struggles of 1963 and 1964, new tactical devices will emerge. The most important single imperative is that we continue moving forward with the indomitable spirit of those two turbulent years. It is worth recalling the admonition of Napoleon (he was thinking of conquest, but what he said was true also of constructive movements): \"In order to have good soldiers, a nation must always be at war.\" -Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965 A Report From Occupied Territory What [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population.

The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools.

The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Martin Luther King Jr., March 15, 1965\n\nWhat [is true of] Harlem is true of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco-is true of every Northern city with a large Negro population. And the police are simply the hired enemies of this population.... They are, moreover-even in a country which makes the very grave error of equating ignorance with simplicity-quite stunningly ignorant; and, since they know that they are hated, they are always afraid. One cannot possibly arrive at a more sure-fire formula for cruelty. This is why those pious calls to \"respect the law,\" always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene. The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer. To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.... Here is the boy, Daniel Hamm [one of the Harlem Six, falsely accused and convicted of murder], speaking-speaking of his country, which has sworn to bring peace and freedom to so many millions: \"They don't want us here. They don't want us-period! All they want us to do is work on these penny-ante jobs for them-and that's it. ... They don't want us on the street 'cause the World's Fair is coming.... So they put us off the streets, so their friends from Europe, Paris or Vietnam-wherever they come from-can come and see this supposed-to-be great city.\" There is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to get bad niggers off the streets. -James Baldwin, July 11, 1966 The American Condition The \"American character\" is at best a nebulous notion-which is one of the reasons for setting up committees on \"un-American\" activities to enshrine and defend it. Thus it was inevitable, in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, that our national make-up should be examined and found wanting by one set of diagnosticians, while another would focus on our ancient virtues and describe the act as one of isolated lunacy.... This is the stand taken by Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky: \"...What happened was not America's fault.\" A comforting declaration-but we cannot wash our hands of Oswald so easily. Assuming that everything happened as the FBI says, he was still a product of Texas (and of New York City), of the American lower-middle class, of the U.S. Marines and so on. All those places and associations are as American as baseball.... There is violence in the American character, probably more than in any other national character.... Oswald expressed that violence in his own fashion. -Editorial, December 21, 1963 Andy Warhol It was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life.... It was what everyone threw away.... Warhol said, \"The Pop artist did images that anybody walking down Broadway could recognize in a split second...all the great modern things that the Abstract Expressionists tried so hard not to notice at all.\" -Arthur C. Danto, writing on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Warhol's sensational Brillo Box exhibition, April 3, 1989 Kremlin Diplomacy The defeat of Indonesian communism has changed the political balance in Asia for quite a few years to come, even if the Communist party eventually recovers. In the whole history of international communism there are only two comparable defeats: one suffered by the Chinese party at Chiang Kai-shek's hands in 1927, and the other inflicted upon the German party by Hitler in 1933. -Isaac Deutscher, January 10, 1966 The vast majority of motorcycle outlaws are uneducated, unskilled men between 20 and 30, and most have no credentials except a police record.... They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation.

The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools.

The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\nThere is a very bitter prescience in what this boy-this \"bad nigger\"-is saying, and he was not born knowing it. We taught it to him in seventeen years. He is draft age now, and if he were not in jail, would very probably be on his way to Southeast Asia. Many of his contemporaries are there.... They are dying there like flies; they are dying in the streets of all our Harlems far more hideously than flies. A member of my family said to me when we learned of the bombing of the four little girls in the Birmingham Sunday school, \"Well, they don't need us for work no more. Where are they building the gas ovens?\" Many Negroes feel this; there is no way not to feel it. Alas, we know our countrymen, municipalities, judges, politicians, policemen and draft boards very well.

They are out of the ballgame and they know it-and that is their meaning; for unlike most losers in today's society, the Hell's Angels not only know but spitefully proclaim exactly where they stand. -Hunter S. Thompson The Vietnamese David may have to give up all the ground he gained in the Tet offensive, but the war will never be the same again. Goliath is in a state of shock. -Editorial,\"Goliath Entrapped,\" February 19, 1968 Paradise Reagan-ed To understand the election of Ronald Reagan as governor of California, it is important to grasp the idea of that state as \"paradise.\" The Eden image has led millions to move there; from the Okie migrations of the thirties to the present the state has swarmed with newcomers. Thus, when an election came up during a time of rapid social change and increasing problems, the people of California fled reality...and brought in a totally inexperienced man who campaigned on the basis of being a political innocent. Now all is simple and wonderful in a land where \"thinking makes it so.\" There is no need for government and, led by an innocent, the Californians can look forward to eternities of joy, while the rest of America, in the land of Nod (East of Eden) must continue to struggle and sweat. -Carey McWilliams, December 5, 1966 Out of the Blue There are many kinds of revolution and for each kind one can find more than one theoretical explanation. But underlying the phenomenon in its major form there is always a radical shift or change in mass consciousness. Suddenly, it seems, people begin to perceive socio-economic situations in a new way. The perspective shifts, the shift is momentous, but it is not as abrupt as it appears on the surface. The change has been gestating over a period measured in years, not in weeks or days. The happenings in Paris are a case in point.... ...It was a wildcat strike on a national scale,...a revolution less against the state as state, than against the current form of society, against the whole technological-bureaucratic pattern of civilization. -Editorial, on May '68 revolt of students and workers, June 3, 1968 The Fear of Violence \"If an election were held today,\" says [Nelson] Algren, \"[Mayor] Daley would win out of fear-out of the fear of violence.

He is a big property man, and the city is full of little property people.\" They don't mind violence-as long as they aren't the victims. -Editorial, following Chicago police riot, September 16, 1968 A Strategy to End Poverty The theory here, to force change through chaos, was among the most provocative of the 1960s. It is widely known...that nearly 8 million persons (half of them white) now subsist on welfare, but it is not generally known that for every person on the rolls at least one more probably meets existing criteria of eligibility but is not obtaining assistance. The discrepancy...is an integral feature of the welfare system which, if challenged, would precipitate a profound financial and political crisis. The force for that challenge, and the strategy we propose, is a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the welfare rolls. -Richard A. Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, May 2, 1966 Individually, the hippies are beautiful. They know a lot the squares don't.

Its racial crisis of 1968 and its murderous failure were those of all America. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went there during the fifth week of a garbage workers' strike that had built into a civil rights movement.... The issues of the strike were broadened to a protest against general conditions for Negroes, not unlike those in cities across the land-police brutality, unfit housing, lack of jobs, low wages, discrimination in schools. These, as Dr. King later noted, were the new national issues of Negro protest, economic at base, the focal point of the Poor People's Campaign. But the main issue in Memphis was dignity. Again and again, preachers, union leaders and others demanded dignity. -Pat Watters, April 22, 1968 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a campaign of repression and assassination is being carried out against the Black Panthers, and that a continuance of this course will see the entire leadership behind bars, or dead....

[T]he important fact about the figures in Smith's film is that one cannot easily tell which are men and which are women. These are \"creatures,\" flaming out in intersexual, polymorphous joy.

The following was written to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Editorial, December 21, 1963\n\nIt was not merely that Brillo pads were part of every household, as the Campbell's Soup can was part of every kitchen-the one item most likely to be found in the barest cupboard,...beyond that, the cardboard container was ubiquitous, disposable and part of Americans' itinerant mode of life....

Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves.

Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves.

Craig Rodwell, a witness to the war in the streets, said in an interview for the documentary Before Stonewall that \"everything came together that night.\" Somewhere in the existential depths of that brawl of screaming transvestites were all the freedom rides, the anti-war marches, the sit-ins, the smoke-ins, the be-ins, the consciousness-raising, the bra-burning, the levitation of the Pentagon, the endless meetings and broken hearts. Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving.

Not only that, but the years of gay men and lesbians locking themselves inside windowless, unnamed bars; writing dangerous, anonymous novels and articles; lying about their identity to their families, their bosses, the military; suffering silently when they were found out; hiding and seeking and winking at each other, or drinking and dying by themselves. And sometimes, not often, braving it out and surviving. It's absolutely astonishing to think that on one early summer's night in New York that world ended, and a new one began. -Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\n-Andrew Kopkind, July 4, 1994\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "'The Great Funk'\n\nWhat to Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nFirst Chapter\n\nBy Thomas Hine\n\nIf you wanted a world that was orderly, where progress was guaranteed, the seventies were a terrible time to be alive. Cars were running out of gas. The country was running out of promise. A president was run out of office. And American troops were running out of Vietnam.\n\nOnly a decade before, as the nation anticipated the conquest of space, the defeat of poverty, an end to racism, and a society where people moved faster and felt better than they ever had before, it seemed that there was nothing America couldn't do. Even the protestors of the sixties objected that America was using its immense wealth and power to do the wrong things, not that it did things wrong. Yet during the seventies it seemed that the United States couldn't do anything right. The country had fallen into the Great Funk.\n\nAmerica even fumbled the celebration of its birthday. In 1975, the United States began a multiyear observance of the two-hundredth anniversary of the American Revolution. Fifteen years earlier, such a celebration would have engaged America, but by the mid-seventies, everything seemed to be falling apart. Four years of pageantry, featuring musket-wielding guys in tricorn hats, didn't feel like a solution for the country's malaise. At many of the commemorations, Gerald Ford, that unelected, unexpected president, said some little-noted words. Ford presided over bicentennial America like a substitute teacher, trying to calm a chaos he had no hand in making and seemed scarcely to understand.\n\nThe bicentennial celebration left few memories, few images or events that have resonated through the decades since. \"Media Burn,\" staged on July 4, 1975, at San Francisco's Cow Palace, is an exception. It was not an official commemoration but rather a project of Ant Farm, an art and architecture collaborative. President Ford was not in attendance as he was at most of the bicen's big moments. Instead, the presiding figure was an imitator of the late President John F. Kennedy, who was remembered at the time as the last real president, or at least the last who didn't leave office in disgrace. \"Haven't you ever wanted to put your foot through your television?\" the ersatz Kennedy asked. In the climactic moment of the event, a specially modified and apparently driverless 1959 Cadillac Eldorado convertible crashed through a wall of vintage television sets. In fact, there was a driver hidden inside the car. And the crash was documented by a camera housed in an additional tail fin, constructed for the purpose.\n\n\"Media Burn\" was a quintessential event of the seventies - bleak, funny, transgressive, and intensely satisfying in a way that was either juvenile or profound. Though it lacked the Betsy Ross impersonators and flag-waving oratory that marked official bicentennial events, it was nevertheless a historical pageant: Kennedy and the Cadillac Eldorado, icons of success in the immediate past, represented an America that was past and seemingly irrecoverable. Only a decade and a half earlier, every part of American culture - from its leaders to its cars and even its linoleum - seemed to promise expansiveness and progress. Americans had watched those television sets and seen the future, but nothing had turned out as advertised.\n\nBy 1975, the future had turned from a promise to a shock. Following the first Arab oil embargo of 1973, the Eldorado and the dream of freedom and luxury it embodied had come to appear grotesque, a true road to ruin. Overnight, Americans went from a world where abundance was assured to one in which scarcity was an ever-looming threat, and they didn't handle it well. Mysterious rumors of shortages of everything from toilet paper to raisins led to runs on supermarkets and hoarding as the everyday necessities of life seemed no longer to be guaranteed. What was, in essence, only a commodity shortage quickly became, for many, an intimation of apocalypse. In the early sixties, people brainstormed about when all human problems would be solved; in the seventies, the talk was about when and how civilization would end.\n\nJust days before \"Media Burn,\" the Vietnam War had come to an ignominious end, with diplomats escaping by helicopter from the roof of the embassy in Saigon. Earlier, Richard Nixon, too, had left in a helicopter, after resigning the presidency in the wake of a bungled burglary and a cover-up that revealed a personality even more diabolical and self-destructively insecure than even his many enemies had imagined. For nearly two years, Americans had seen the intellectually brilliant, sometimes visionary president they had reelected in a landslide ever so slowly revealed as a foul-mouthed conspirator, condemned by his own words on his own secret tapes. (\"NIXON BUGGED HIMSELF\" screamed the New York Post headline.) Spiro T. Agnew, Nixon's vice president, had resigned as well, in the wake of a tax-evasion scandal.\n\nAnd then there was the economy, producing very little actual growth, while prices were rising at a double-digit pace. This was something that elementary economics textbooks said could not happen, and yet it did. This so-called stagflation so traumatized politicians and policy makers that for the rest of the century, their central goal was to assure that it would not happen again. \"Things can't get any worse,\" was the expert consensus in 1970, after the booming economy of the sixties started to sputter in 1968 and inflation persisted the following year. The experts, it turned out, had no idea. You could get eight loaves of bread for a dollar at the supermarket in 1970. The next year, that dollar bought five; in 1973, four; and by the end of the decade, one and part of a second. In 1974, following the imposition of wage and price controls that had only made matters worse, President Ford was encouraging Americans to wear little buttons that said \"WIN - Whip Inflation Now,\" even as prices rose 13.9 percent in that one year. The seventies began with worries over home mortgage rates approaching 7 percent and ended with them at 13 percent, on the way to a high of 18 percent in 1981.\n\nMany more Americans were feeling like losers as the economy entered unfamiliar territory. Ever since World War II, Americans had come to expect ever higher living standards and greater economic opportunities. During the seventies, income equality decreased, and ladders of advancement disappeared. After dominating the world economy for more than three decades, the United States saw its balance of trade with the rest of the world begin to slip into the red during the early 1970s, and stay there permanently after 1976. Americans had turned from a nation of producers to one of consumers. American workers, who had long been able to ignore the rest of the world, had to worry about competition from overseas.\n\nNearly all American cities experienced a dramatic increase in crime during the decade, and some truly bizarre crimes made headlines. In 1973 and 1974 in San Francisco, a band of black supremacists known as the Death Angels killed fourteen and injured seven in what became known as the Zebra murders. The first of what became known as the Son of Sam murders took place in New York in the summer of 1976, and twelve more attacks, resulting in five more murders, happened during the next year. The killer claimed that he had been ordered to commit the crimes by his neighbor's Labrador retriever. In San Francisco in 1978, a member of the city's board of supervisors shot the city's mayor and another supervisor, then won clemency because, his lawyers argued, his judgment was impaired by eating too many Twinkies and other sugary foods. Call it the Decade of Poor Excuses.\n\nPerhaps the most horrible revelation was at Love Canal, near Niagara Falls, New York. There, a chemical company had buried barrels of extremely toxic chemicals atop which a public elementary school and more than one hundred houses were built. For more than twenty-five years, these chemicals leaked, causing such grotesqueries as babies born with two rows of teeth on their lower jaw and skulls that failed to fuse together, while adults had extremely high incidences of rare ailments. Its revelation, the result of an activist mother putting all the pieces together and demanding a school transfer for her child, was more than just a horrible litany of human suffering. It was like an outpouring of long-suppressed evil that had been denied during sunnier times but was now inescapable.\n\nOverseas, the revolution in Iran in 1979 led to yet another gasoline crisis in the United States. Following the revolutionary students' seizure of the embassy in Tehran in October, fifty-two Americans spent 444 days as hostages. An attempt to rescue them in April 1980 proved a disaster and contributed to President Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 elections.\n\nEven parts of the world that didn't suffer through America's traumas of Watergate and Vietnam suffered from the same economic stagnation, fear of scarcity, and trepidation about the future. In Europe, terrorism was becoming a fact of life. Terrorists disrupted the 1972 Olympics, killing eleven athletes and a dream of peaceful competition. In Britain and Ireland, street-corner bombings became routine, and in Italy a prime minister was kidnapped.\n\nIn space, an increase in solar radiation doomed Skylab, the first U.S. orbiting space station, which fell out of the sky on June 11, 1979, just about a decade after the first moon landing. The sky was falling, if only on Australia.\n\nThe contemporary consensus is clear. The seventies were awful. The important things were awful, and the trivial things were awful. The politicians were awful. The economy was awful. Those insipid harvest gold and avocado kitchens were awful. Those polyester clothes that looked like tailored sponges were awful. The gas lines were awful. The pudgy AMC Pacer automobile was awful. As for Earth shoes, whose raised toe and lowered heel turned every walk into an uphill climb, they were awful too. And don't even mention disco! Call it a slum of a decade, and people will smile and nod knowingly.

The gas lines were awful. The pudgy AMC Pacer automobile was awful. As for Earth shoes, whose raised toe and lowered heel turned every walk into an uphill climb, they were awful too. And don't even mention disco! Call it a slum of a decade, and people will smile and nod knowingly. Even in an era like ours that seems nostalgic for everything, seventies style sounds like an oxymoron, an aesthetic whose allure seems mysterious even, or especially, to those who once embraced it.\n\n(Continues...)\n\nExcerpted from The Great Funk by Thomas Hine Copyright © 2007 by Thomas Hine.

      "text": "Discriminating Tastes\n\nThe Reverend Jeremiah Wright, President Obama's former pastor, has often described his preaching style as prophetic, and, sure enough, his brief but spectacular turn in the campaign limelight last year has proved a harbinger of things to come. After months of criticism, Obama renounced Wright, whose fiery sermons had been widely excoriated as \"racist\"-that is, anti-white. Around the same time, Obama explained that when he described his grandmother as a \"typical white person,\" he hadn't meant to insult white people. Then, following the Inauguration, some protested that the Reverend Joseph Lowery's benediction, derived from an old blues song, was anti-white. And Newt Gingrich used his Twitter account to call Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Sonia Sotomayor-and her \"wise Latina\" remark-\"racist.\" (A few days later, he took it back.)\n\nOne imagines that Sergeant James Crowley, of the Cambridge Police Department, had not meant to contribute to this ongoing argument when, on July 16th, he responded to a 911 call from a woman who said that there had been \"two gentlemen trying to get in a house,\" and, after a dispute, ended up arresting Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the Harvard professor who lives there. One imagines the same of President Obama, who, when asked about the incident during a press conference the next week, said that racial profiling was a nationwide problem, and that, in this case, the police had \"acted stupidly.\" Critics claimed that Obama's comments reflected his own biases. Thaddeus McCotter, a Republican congressman from Michigan, drafted a resolution calling on him to apologize to Crowley. National Review Online accused him of \"racial self-aggrandizement.\" And the radio and television host Glenn Beck said that the President had revealed his \"deep-seated hatred for white people,\" adding, \"This guy is, I believe, a racist.\"\n\nHalf a century ago, when people talked about anti-white racism, it was often depicted as a symptom of a broader derangement. In \"The Hate That Hate Produced,\" an influential television documentary about Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, from 1959, Mike Wallace warned viewers about \"the rise of black racism\" and \"black supremacy.\" (Four years later, a cover story in Jet reported that Eartha Kitt considered herself a victim of \"reverse racism\"; the magazine said that \"black supremacists\" resented her marriage to a white man.) But, in the late nineteen-sixties and early seventies, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Act and the executive orders that followed, accusations of reverse racism grew less personal and more commonplace. Newspapers printed articles and letters about anti-white discrimination in the workplace. Later, protracted legal battles over affirmative action helped popularize a once novel character: the white civil-rights plaintiff.\n\nLink copied\n\nAffirmative action, it now seems clear, helped change white America's attitude about race, although not entirely in the way that its creators intended. In 1982, scarcely a decade after President Nixon mandated affirmative action for companies with government contracts, a study published in the American Sociological Review found that only twenty-seven per cent of whites thought that blacks had a worse than average chance of succeeding in America, while slightly more, about twenty-nine per cent, thought that blacks' opportunities were better than average. Sixty-three per cent thought that racial minorities enjoyed at least a little bit of \"unfair\" reverse discrimination.\n\nThere are plenty of people in America, especially in black America, who believe that reverse racism is a contradiction in terms. Racism, the argument goes, should not be thought of as a personal failing; it's a social system, with a specific history. Discrimination against whites, however unfair, isn't part of that system, and therefore is not analogous to discrimination against blacks. This history adds symbolic weight to stories that might otherwise inspire only passing curiosity-like, say, the one about the black Harvard professor who was suspected of breaking into his own house. Systemic racism doesn't require malice, or a specific perpetrator; everyone who benefits is guilty, even people who don't think that they benefit.\n\nIn the past few decades, though, reverse racism has undergone a similar redefinition, from symptom to system. Some who are skeptical of affirmative action, and of other programs designed to advance non-whites, consider reverse racism to be so pervasive, and so well entrenched, that it can only be described as systemic. (Think of Frank Ricci, the white firefighter who argued, successfully, that the city of New Haven had violated his civil rights.) And, despite Beck's diagnosis of Obama's \"hatred,\" many of the people who worry about Obama's view of race see him not as personally bigoted but as complicit with anti-white interests and policies.\n\nIn fact, the \"reverse\" has largely been dropped from \"reverse racism\"; in today's mainstream political discourse, \"racism\" regularly refers to anti-white racism. Meanwhile, many politicians and commentators concerned with the brutal legacy of old-fashioned racism have learned to speak about it in less abstract, less inflammatory terms: they talk about too-high incarceration rates, or the need for better communication between police officers and the communities they serve. Certainly, Obama is at his most effective when he sticks to concrete prescriptions (the means) and airy evocations of progress (the end). This, by and large, has been his strategy and his script, and even he may not know exactly why, on being asked about Gates, he strayed from it.\n\nThe Cambridge morality play culminated in a much bruited meeting at the White House between Obama, Gates, Crowley, and-a surprise addition-Vice-President Joe Biden. Because the press was kept at a distance, many stations ran surreal, near-silent footage of four men sipping beer, accompanied only by the soothing percussion of clicking cameras. Afterward, there were cheerful but vague reviews from the participants (Crowley, \"A cordial and productive discussion\"; Gates, \"We hit it off\"), and promises to keep the conversation going. Obama, for his part, seemed ready, maybe even eager, to change the subject. He had discovered, surely, that a black President can pay a price for talking about racism. And he was no doubt reminded that to some Americans \"racism\" doesn't mean what it used to. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "#FYF911: why conservative media thinks Black Lives Matter is planning 9/11 attacks on police\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nThis September 11, law enforcement officials are reportedly on high alert for attacks on white people and police officers - attacks that conservative media is warning will come from Black Lives Matter activists. But the threat is mostly imaginary. And there's no evidence that they come from Black Lives Matter.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the Daily Caller , a conservative site, from reporting that several law enforcement agencies were sending out \"BOLO\" (Be On the LookOut) alerts for \"Black Lives Matter attacks\" on police. Their evidence that activists were planning to attack police: an online video declaring \"open season on white people,\" recorded by one of the organizers of a group called \"F**k Yo Flag\" - which is encouraging people to hold rallies on September 11 to burn the US flag, in Stone Mountain, Georgia, and around the country.\n\nThe Daily Caller and other conservative sites like Breitbart portray \"F**k Yo Flag\" as an outcropping of the Black Lives Matter movement - and since \"Black Lives Matter\" is a lot more well-known, other outlets are running with the \"Black Lives Matter attacks\" narrative. But the evidence connecting the two is more or less nonexistent - and says a lot more about the willingness of some people to believe that protests against police brutality are inherently dangerous than about the actual state of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n#FuckYoFlag is what it sounds like: a rejection of America and its flag in the name of rejecting white supremacy. Essentially, the supporters of #FuckYoFlag are taking the sentiments many people feel toward the Confederate flag - that it's a symbol of racist oppression that doesn't deserve respect - and arguing that America is also a white supremacist nation and, thus, the same logic applies.\n\nThe hashtag appears to have started this spring, after college student Eric Sheppard was photographed stepping on an American flag at a protest, and was subsequently charged with carrying a firearm in his backpack while on campus.\n\n#fyf911 Much honor & respect to #EricSheppard pic.twitter.com/GCYM3wQkDt\n\nThe firearms charge appears to be justified, but some people believed Sheppard was being targeted because of his actions - which are, of course, protected under the First Amendment. So some people on social media took up the \"Eric Sheppard Challenge,\" which involved posting photos of themselves stepping on American flags. The #FuckYoFlag hashtag appears to have grown out of that challenge.\n\nIt's really hard to tell how many people are actually affiliated with \"Fuck Yo Flag\" (sometimes also spelled \"Fuk Yo Flag\"), or how many participated in the Eric Sheppard Challenge. But because some conservatives were riled up by the very idea of the Eric Sheppard Challenge - and by particularly provocative photos showing people using the American flag as toilet paper - the challenge got a certain amount of media play.\n\nThe FYF \"movement\" does exist; there is a website (that implausibly claims \"FUCK YO FLAG (#FYF911) is the most powerful movement in the world right now\"), and the online radio show 2 Raw 4 TV has adopted the movement as a cause. But it's difficult to tell how many of the people following the movement's organizers on social media are legitimately interested and how many are white conservatives looking for a fight.\n\nConservatives and conservative media have been tracking FYF for a while, and painting them as a violent splinter group of the Black Lives Matter movement. Over the summer, Breitbart News reported that a white military veteran who'd gotten on an FYF conference call was accused of being an infiltrator and that FYF members threatened to kill his pregnant wife; there doesn't appear to be evidence of this beyond the veteran's word, and the host of 2 Raw 4 TV released a video saying those were \"false rumors with no truth whatsoever.\"\n\nThis summer, the organizers of FYF started calling for people to hold protests on September 11 to burn \"the American flag, Confederate flag, British flag, KKK hood, police uniform and/or any other symbol of organized colonialism, racism or imperialism.\"\n\nWhy September 11? There's clearly a bit of 9/11 trutherism mixed in with the FYF movement; the website says, \"We recognize that these imperial powers attacked their own citizens on 9/11 in an attempt to gain more power from its people,\" and the host of 2 Raw 4 TV tweeted:\n\nIF YOU THINK 9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB HASHTAG #FYF911 NOW!\n\nOn August 30, King Noble, one of the leaders of FYF, posted a cellphone video to YouTube in which he talked about several recent shootings of police officers, and declared it \"open season\" on white people and police officers. The video doesn't actually tell viewers to do anything, and it doesn't explicitly tie the \"open season\" to the 9/11 protests (though in a subsequent video, King Noble \"announced the secret location\" of the Atlanta protest to be Stone Mountain).\n\nA conservative YouTuber posted an edited selection of the audio from King Noble's video as \"#blacklivesmatter #fyf911 Open season on killing whites and cops.\" The YouTuber (whose handle is Illwriteit.com) said the audio came from an online radio show affiliated with FYF hosted on blogtalk.com. That appears inaccurate: 2 Raw 4 TV is hosted on blogtalk.com, and King Noble is a frequent guest, but it doesn't appear to have posted an episode on the day Illwriteit claimed. In any event, the audio is identical to sections of King Noble's original YouTube video.\n\nIllwriteit's YouTube video, with the edited version of King Noble's remarks, is the one law enforcement officers picked up on, according to the Daily Caller. Law enforcement started sending out alerts this week to be on the lookout for black anti-police violence on September 11. The Daily Caller sees the story as evidence that Black Lives Matter is more dangerous than people think; when I read the story on their site, I got this overlaid on the story's text:\n\nScreenshot of the Daily Caller.\n\nNo hate crimes against police officers or white people have been reported as of this writing.\n\nThere is a big, big difference between \"some dude on the internet says it's open season on police\" and \"the Black Lives Matter movement is planning to attack police officers.\" Conservative media outlets vacillate between calling FYF a \"splinter group\" of Black Lives Matter, and portraying the two as the same (as the phrases \"Black Lives Matter attacks\" used by the Daily Caller and Raw Story , and \"Black Lives Matter 9/11 Anniversary Threat\" used by the International Business Times , imply). But they're insistent on establishing a connection.\n\nBecause Black Lives Matter is such an amorphous movement - even people extremely active within the movement have disagreed about who gets to \"represent\" it in meetings with presidential candidates - it's impossible, and foolish, to try to define what \"affiliated\" means. The YouTuber who posted King Noble's edited audio - and referred to it as \"#blacklivesmatter #fyf911 open season\" - based the association on a segment of King Noble's video that said this:\n\nthe Black Lives Matter movement wasn't enough. We tried to appeal to them, to let them know that this kind of thing would happen. They thought they were indestructible and invincible...and now they got black men out there who just can't. Take it. Any. More. And they're willing to act out.\n\nThe YouTuber claims this means \"#blacklivesmatter admits to being affiliated.\" And sure, the use of \"we\" could imply that King Noble considered himself a part of Black Lives Matter, but now thinks black people need to go further. But it's also possible to read it as a rejection of Black Lives Matter.\n\nWhat King Noble personally feels about Black Lives Matter, however, doesn't establish whether what he says can be attributed to the movement at all. And there just doesn't seem to be any attention paid to him, or to #FYF911, by known Black Lives Matter members. There has been some discussion on Twitter about what 9/11 should mean in the context of Black Lives Matter. Some people see the \"Never Forget\" attitude toward the attack and its victims as the type of respect Americans are all too willing to give to innocent people killed by nonwhites but all too unwilling to give to nonwhite people killed by white people; others point out that black people were killed in 9/11 too. But FYF, let alone \"open season,\" simply hasn't been a public topic of discussion among the people who have emerged as leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThis is far from the first time people have connected Black Lives Matter to violence in general and anti-police violence in particular. In August - after the shootings of police that King Noble was talking about - Fox News wondered aloud whether Black Lives Matter should be considered a \"hate group.\"\n\nSome of this is straightforward: Many Americans believe that police deserve respect by default, and that protesting them is unfair at best and dangerous at worst. Law enforcement officers are extremely eager to promote the idea that protests against police are threats to their safety. They claim that activists who call attention to police use of force are encouraging other people to hate the police - and might inspire some of them to react violently against them.\n\nIn New York, after the murder of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in 2014, one police union allegedly evoked the old high-crime era of the 1970s and 1980s in warning officers not to patrol unless they had to - resulting in a two-week-long \"slowdown\" over the last weeks of that year. Their implication: Police are the reason that crime is so much lower now than it was then, and if you turn on police, crime will shoot back up.\n\nThe man who killed Liu and Ramos did, in fact, invoke the names of black men killed by police on social media, implying that he was seeking revenge. Similarly, the man who killed two local television reporters during a live broadcast in August left a rambling note that alleged that whites wanted a \"race war\" and he would give them one (a reference to the alleged shooter in Charleston, South Carolina, who told police he hoped to instigate a race war). So these men were both using ideas that were in the public eye. But there's also substantial evidence to suggest that both of them were severely emotionally disturbed in other ways. It's very hard to say that something is the \"true motive\" for a violent act, as opposed to a convenient justification hit on by someone grasping for meaning.\n\nBut there's also a very big difference between saying an individual act perpetrated by a sole actor was inspired (in whole or in part) by a movement, and saying the movement in general encourages those acts - much less that it's looking to perpetrate them. The latter only makes sense if you see Black Lives Matter as inherently anti-white and anti-police. And that's more complicated.\n\nThe YouTuber who reposted the audio of King Noble's \"open season\" remarks prefaces it with a claim that he's not interested in attacking all African Americans - just people who are willing to practice violence on those who are different. While the narrator is saying this, the screen shows a series of social media posts and profiles from people who call themselves \"black supremacists\" and make comments about how you can't be pro-black without being anti-white. (Many of these are jokes about how the only thing that's both pro-black and pro-white is a zebra.)\n\nThose profiles aren't calling for violence. But they explain why the YouTuber (and the conservatives and police officers who treated his video as evidence of \"Black Lives Matter\"-coordinated attacks) are so willing to see King Noble as representative of Black Lives Matter. They think Black Lives Matter is an inherently anti-white slogan and movement, so other activists must agree with King Noble's goals - whether they agree with his tactics is just haggling over the details.\n\nThat's exactly why \"all lives matter\" has come up as a response to \"black lives matter,\" as well as a slogan among racists looking to share stories about how black Americans are the true threats. Many people have a great deal of difficulty understanding why anyone would say \"black lives matter\" if they didn't think white lives mattered less.\n\nThis is circular: The reason \"black lives matter\" became a slogan to begin with was that activists felt that some people needed to be reminded that black lives mattered as much as white lives, because no one needed to be reminded white lives mattered. They were reacting to a system that assigned different levels of value to lives based on race. But by making a difference explicit, they've been hit with the charge that they're the ones who created that difference to begin with.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

      "text": "#FYF911: why conservative media thinks Black Lives Matter is planning 9/11 attacks on police\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nThis September 11, law enforcement officials are reportedly on high alert for attacks on white people and police officers - attacks that conservative media is warning will come from Black Lives Matter activists. But the threat is mostly imaginary. And there's no evidence that they come from Black Lives Matter.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the Daily Caller , a conservative site, from reporting that several law enforcement agencies were sending out \"BOLO\" (Be On the LookOut) alerts for \"Black Lives Matter attacks\" on police. Their evidence that activists were planning to attack police: an online video declaring \"open season on white people,\" recorded by one of the organizers of a group called \"F**k Yo Flag\" - which is encouraging people to hold rallies on September 11 to burn the US flag, in Stone Mountain, Georgia, and around the country.\n\nThe Daily Caller and other conservative sites like Breitbart portray \"F**k Yo Flag\" as an outcropping of the Black Lives Matter movement - and since \"Black Lives Matter\" is a lot more well-known, other outlets are running with the \"Black Lives Matter attacks\" narrative. But the evidence connecting the two is more or less nonexistent - and says a lot more about the willingness of some people to believe that protests against police brutality are inherently dangerous than about the actual state of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n#FuckYoFlag is what it sounds like: a rejection of America and its flag in the name of rejecting white supremacy. Essentially, the supporters of #FuckYoFlag are taking the sentiments many people feel toward the Confederate flag - that it's a symbol of racist oppression that doesn't deserve respect - and arguing that America is also a white supremacist nation and, thus, the same logic applies.\n\nThe hashtag appears to have started this spring, after college student Eric Sheppard was photographed stepping on an American flag at a protest, and was subsequently charged with carrying a firearm in his backpack while on campus.\n\n#fyf911 Much honor & respect to #EricSheppard pic.twitter.com/GCYM3wQkDt\n\nThe firearms charge appears to be justified, but some people believed Sheppard was being targeted because of his actions - which are, of course, protected under the First Amendment. So some people on social media took up the \"Eric Sheppard Challenge,\" which involved posting photos of themselves stepping on American flags. The #FuckYoFlag hashtag appears to have grown out of that challenge.\n\nIt's really hard to tell how many people are actually affiliated with \"Fuck Yo Flag\" (sometimes also spelled \"Fuk Yo Flag\"), or how many participated in the Eric Sheppard Challenge. But because some conservatives were riled up by the very idea of the Eric Sheppard Challenge - and by particularly provocative photos showing people using the American flag as toilet paper - the challenge got a certain amount of media play.\n\nThe FYF \"movement\" does exist; there is a website (that implausibly claims \"FUCK YO FLAG (#FYF911) is the most powerful movement in the world right now\"), and the online radio show 2 Raw 4 TV has adopted the movement as a cause. But it's difficult to tell how many of the people following the movement's organizers on social media are legitimately interested and how many are white conservatives looking for a fight.\n\nConservatives and conservative media have been tracking FYF for a while, and painting them as a violent splinter group of the Black Lives Matter movement. Over the summer, Breitbart News reported that a white military veteran who'd gotten on an FYF conference call was accused of being an infiltrator and that FYF members threatened to kill his pregnant wife; there doesn't appear to be evidence of this beyond the veteran's word, and the host of 2 Raw 4 TV released a video saying those were \"false rumors with no truth whatsoever.\"\n\nThis summer, the organizers of FYF started calling for people to hold protests on September 11 to burn \"the American flag, Confederate flag, British flag, KKK hood, police uniform and/or any other symbol of organized colonialism, racism or imperialism.\"\n\nWhy September 11? There's clearly a bit of 9/11 trutherism mixed in with the FYF movement; the website says, \"We recognize that these imperial powers attacked their own citizens on 9/11 in an attempt to gain more power from its people,\" and the host of 2 Raw 4 TV tweeted:\n\nIF YOU THINK 9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB HASHTAG #FYF911 NOW!\n\nOn August 30, King Noble, one of the leaders of FYF, posted a cellphone video to YouTube in which he talked about several recent shootings of police officers, and declared it \"open season\" on white people and police officers. The video doesn't actually tell viewers to do anything, and it doesn't explicitly tie the \"open season\" to the 9/11 protests (though in a subsequent video, King Noble \"announced the secret location\" of the Atlanta protest to be Stone Mountain).\n\nA conservative YouTuber posted an edited selection of the audio from King Noble's video as \"#blacklivesmatter #fyf911 Open season on killing whites and cops.\" The YouTuber (whose handle is Illwriteit.com) said the audio came from an online radio show affiliated with FYF hosted on blogtalk.com. That appears inaccurate: 2 Raw 4 TV is hosted on blogtalk.com, and King Noble is a frequent guest, but it doesn't appear to have posted an episode on the day Illwriteit claimed. In any event, the audio is identical to sections of King Noble's original YouTube video.\n\nIllwriteit's YouTube video, with the edited version of King Noble's remarks, is the one law enforcement officers picked up on, according to the Daily Caller. Law enforcement started sending out alerts this week to be on the lookout for black anti-police violence on September 11. The Daily Caller sees the story as evidence that Black Lives Matter is more dangerous than people think; when I read the story on their site, I got this overlaid on the story's text:\n\nScreenshot of the Daily Caller.\n\nNo hate crimes against police officers or white people have been reported as of this writing.\n\nThere is a big, big difference between \"some dude on the internet says it's open season on police\" and \"the Black Lives Matter movement is planning to attack police officers.\" Conservative media outlets vacillate between calling FYF a \"splinter group\" of Black Lives Matter, and portraying the two as the same (as the phrases \"Black Lives Matter attacks\" used by the Daily Caller and Raw Story , and \"Black Lives Matter 9/11 Anniversary Threat\" used by the International Business Times , imply). But they're insistent on establishing a connection.\n\nBecause Black Lives Matter is such an amorphous movement - even people extremely active within the movement have disagreed about who gets to \"represent\" it in meetings with presidential candidates - it's impossible, and foolish, to try to define what \"affiliated\" means. The YouTuber who posted King Noble's edited audio - and referred to it as \"#blacklivesmatter #fyf911 open season\" - based the association on a segment of King Noble's video that said this:\n\nthe Black Lives Matter movement wasn't enough. We tried to appeal to them, to let them know that this kind of thing would happen. They thought they were indestructible and invincible...and now they got black men out there who just can't. Take it. Any. More. And they're willing to act out.\n\nThe YouTuber claims this means \"#blacklivesmatter admits to being affiliated.\" And sure, the use of \"we\" could imply that King Noble considered himself a part of Black Lives Matter, but now thinks black people need to go further. But it's also possible to read it as a rejection of Black Lives Matter.\n\nWhat King Noble personally feels about Black Lives Matter, however, doesn't establish whether what he says can be attributed to the movement at all. And there just doesn't seem to be any attention paid to him, or to #FYF911, by known Black Lives Matter members. There has been some discussion on Twitter about what 9/11 should mean in the context of Black Lives Matter. Some people see the \"Never Forget\" attitude toward the attack and its victims as the type of respect Americans are all too willing to give to innocent people killed by nonwhites but all too unwilling to give to nonwhite people killed by white people; others point out that black people were killed in 9/11 too. But FYF, let alone \"open season,\" simply hasn't been a public topic of discussion among the people who have emerged as leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThis is far from the first time people have connected Black Lives Matter to violence in general and anti-police violence in particular. In August - after the shootings of police that King Noble was talking about - Fox News wondered aloud whether Black Lives Matter should be considered a \"hate group.\"\n\nSome of this is straightforward: Many Americans believe that police deserve respect by default, and that protesting them is unfair at best and dangerous at worst. Law enforcement officers are extremely eager to promote the idea that protests against police are threats to their safety. They claim that activists who call attention to police use of force are encouraging other people to hate the police - and might inspire some of them to react violently against them.\n\nIn New York, after the murder of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in 2014, one police union allegedly evoked the old high-crime era of the 1970s and 1980s in warning officers not to patrol unless they had to - resulting in a two-week-long \"slowdown\" over the last weeks of that year. Their implication: Police are the reason that crime is so much lower now than it was then, and if you turn on police, crime will shoot back up.\n\nThe man who killed Liu and Ramos did, in fact, invoke the names of black men killed by police on social media, implying that he was seeking revenge. Similarly, the man who killed two local television reporters during a live broadcast in August left a rambling note that alleged that whites wanted a \"race war\" and he would give them one (a reference to the alleged shooter in Charleston, South Carolina, who told police he hoped to instigate a race war). So these men were both using ideas that were in the public eye. But there's also substantial evidence to suggest that both of them were severely emotionally disturbed in other ways. It's very hard to say that something is the \"true motive\" for a violent act, as opposed to a convenient justification hit on by someone grasping for meaning.\n\nBut there's also a very big difference between saying an individual act perpetrated by a sole actor was inspired (in whole or in part) by a movement, and saying the movement in general encourages those acts - much less that it's looking to perpetrate them. The latter only makes sense if you see Black Lives Matter as inherently anti-white and anti-police. And that's more complicated.\n\nThe YouTuber who reposted the audio of King Noble's \"open season\" remarks prefaces it with a claim that he's not interested in attacking all African Americans - just people who are willing to practice violence on those who are different. While the narrator is saying this, the screen shows a series of social media posts and profiles from people who call themselves \"black supremacists\" and make comments about how you can't be pro-black without being anti-white. (Many of these are jokes about how the only thing that's both pro-black and pro-white is a zebra.)\n\nThose profiles aren't calling for violence. But they explain why the YouTuber (and the conservatives and police officers who treated his video as evidence of \"Black Lives Matter\"-coordinated attacks) are so willing to see King Noble as representative of Black Lives Matter. They think Black Lives Matter is an inherently anti-white slogan and movement, so other activists must agree with King Noble's goals - whether they agree with his tactics is just haggling over the details.\n\nThat's exactly why \"all lives matter\" has come up as a response to \"black lives matter,\" as well as a slogan among racists looking to share stories about how black Americans are the true threats.

      "text": "Muhammad Ali: the glory and the struggle\n\nEditor's Note: Peniel E. Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in ethics and political values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of \" Stokely: A Life \" and \" The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. \" The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nWhen Muhammad Ali died in 2016 , he was accorded the equivalent of a state funeral, complete with a eulogy that featured President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. During the last three decades of his life, from lighting the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996 until his death, Ali became a virtually sanctified figure, embodying the movements for civil and human rights that he came to symbolize in America and around the world.\n\nAs \"Muhammad Ali,\" a new four-part documentary series made by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon explains, it didn't start out this way. The film's cumulative power, for both a historian familiar with the period and for people less familiar with this history, is its ability to unpeel hidden layers of a story that has become American folklore.\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" offers the most fulsome portrait of the iconic sports star to date, showing him to be a man full of paradoxes. A freedom fighter who abandoned one of his early mentors, Malcolm X, in favor of a group that would take advantage of him for over a decade. A Black nationalist and pan-Africanist who warmly shared the stage with the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, whose legendary corruption and record of human rights violations seemed antithetical to Ali's human rights advocacy. A family man whose multiple marriages were marked by infidelity.\n\nRelated video Why Ken Burns took on 'the greatest athlete of the 20th century'\n\nThe film successfully illuminates how the highs and lows of Muhammad Ali's life personify much of the political conflict and racial upheaval that marked American life - and the larger world - in the 1960s. The mythology of Ali that emerged in the 1990s onward tends to sanitize this legacy, making the icon a more comfortable exemplar of American exceptionalism by smoothing his rough edges (and America's, too). This documentary's greatness lies in how it reminds a new generation of audiences that Muhammad Ali's athletic excellence and political rebellion mutually defined not only his time but also our own era of racial and political reckoning.\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" expertly locates the roots of the age of Black Lives Matter in the political storms of the 1960s. The film's depictions of that era's racial segregation, police brutality and cultural antipathy for Black folk feel achingly familiar to contemporary audiences.\n\nAli's audacity - telling reporters (and many White Americans) in 1964 after becoming world heavyweight champion, \"I don't have to be what you want me to be, I'm free to be who I want\" - disrupted an unspoken racial compact for Black athletes and reimagined the boundaries of the possible in ways that anticipated our present moment.\n\nBorn and raised in the violently segregated city of Louisville , Kentucky, of the 1940s and 1950s, Cassius Marcellus Clay came of age in a historical milieu indelibly shaped by race. Clay was only six months younger than Emmett Till, whose 1955 lynching in Mississippi sent shockwaves throughout the nation, including Clay's hometown.\n\nThe young Clay found a safe haven in boxing, where he displayed keen observational abilities to go along with the fastest hands in the history of heavyweight boxing; by 1960, at the age of 18, he had won an Olympic gold medal in Rome. At first, reporters loved the handsome, brash and cocky young fighter whose quotable lines - like \"I'm so mean, I make medicine sick\" - made for good copy.\n\nUntil they didn't.\n\nOne of the many pleasures of Ali documentary is watching Clay's evolution into Muhammad Ali. Clay had purposefully stayed out of the civil rights struggles that were increasingly making headlines during the early 1960s - better to protect his sponsors, \"the Louisville Syndicate,\" the White power brokers bankrolling his early career. Yet he yearned for a personal dignity that he quickly realized could not be bought.\n\nClay found inspiration in the Nation of Islam; an encounter with a Nation of Islam member selling the newspaper, \"Muhammad Speaks,\" in Miami, where he trained for fights, piqued his curiosity about becoming a Muslim. Attending religious services at Miami's Temple No. 29 Mosque, where ministers preached that God was Black, showed Clay an alternate reality to the institutions of White supremacy normalized in his youth. Clay flourished, hearing a message of Black political and cultural self-determination that dovetailed with his own aspirations for enjoying a kind of personal dignity perpetually denied to African Americans.\n\nThe film provides a potent explanation to why Clay became so attracted to the Nation of Islam. Rather than abandon the Black world he grew up in for anticipated riches, Clay sought dignity for himself and others. As a budding NOI devotee, Clay met Malcolm X, the group's national representative, who would become one his most important friends and mentors. Clay and Malcolm grew attracted to each other's hidden depths, rarely visible to the general public.\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" slows down the story of the young champion boxer's rise enough for us to see the risks - some would say reckless - the young Clay took in shaping his personal and professional destiny. Drawn to a religious group characterized by some mainstream journalists as \"Black supremacists\" held the potential to destroy Clay's boxing career, but he refused to back down, maintaining his religious faith as a protective shield against racist insults and threats.\n\nThe film also explores Ali's eventual rejection of Malcolm X in detail, offering one example of the way in which the champ's charisma and bravado at times concealed a gift for self-preservation that could be ruthless.\n\nWhile guiding Ali's evolution in his identity as a Black Muslim, Malcolm X was falling out with the leader of the National of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm broke with Muhammad in early 1964, announcing his plans to form his own organization. In May 1964 Ali toured Africa on a trip initially orchestrated by Malcolm, with whom he briefly reunited with in Accra, Ghana. Malcolm tried to greet him; with harsh words, Ali turned away. Their friendship ended there, to Ali's later regret , especially since Malcolm was killed the following year in a political assassination while giving a speech in New York.\n\nAs the film shows, Ali became, by his trip to Africa, a global symbol of Black pride. He embraced the NOI's racial separatism not out of weakness but from a position of strength. He basked in his growing celebrity, meeting with African leaders, wading through tremendous crowds and deepening his ties to a global Islamic community.\n\nAli's personal belief in Islam dovetailed with political convictions about the need to confront White supremacy, no matter the cost. \"Muhammad Ali\" illustrates how even as his significance to Black communities in the United States and abroad grew, Ali's charisma, bravado and humor curdled in the eyes of millions of White Americans as he strayed further from their idea of what a Black male athlete should be. Ali's refusal to fight in, or approve of, the Vietnam War turned him into a despised figure in mainstream America and burnished his stature as a countercultural icon.\n\nDenied status as a conscientious objector, hounded by a boxing commission's refusal to let him fight domestically, Ali fought overseas throughout 1966 before being stripped of his boxing license and heavyweight championship the next year, for refusing to be drafted into the army.\n\nSentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for resisting the draft in 1967 , Ali became an itinerant Black Power spokesperson, with the NOI distancing themselves from the former champ as he faced stiff political headwinds. In so doing, Ali became a model for Black resistance to systemic racism domestically and American imperialism abroad.\n\nThe fighter once so quick he could evade the blows of all of his opponents now discovered that he could take a punch, figuratively and literally. In the 1970s Ali engaged in a series of brutal matches, fighting Joe Frazier three times , and regaining the heavyweight championship in an upset victory over George Foreman in the \" Rumble in the Jungle \" in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nAli's professional redemption paralleled the rise of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in America. His popularity within the Black community spread into the mainstream and he became a kind of Rorschach test for the nation. His professional rivalry with Joe Frazier re-captivated the imagination of the predominantly White sports world. The film documents how Ali vilified Frazier as \"ugly\" and \"dumb,\" a man whose only admirer was conservative President Richard Nixon.

Yet he yearned for a personal dignity that he quickly realized could not be bought.\n\nClay found inspiration in the Nation of Islam; an encounter with a Nation of Islam member selling the newspaper, \"Muhammad Speaks,\" in Miami, where he trained for fights, piqued his curiosity about becoming a Muslim. Attending religious services at Miami's Temple No. 29 Mosque, where ministers preached that God was Black, showed Clay an alternate reality to the institutions of White supremacy normalized in his youth. Clay flourished, hearing a message of Black political and cultural self-determination that dovetailed with his own aspirations for enjoying a kind of personal dignity perpetually denied to African Americans.\n\nThe film provides a potent explanation to why Clay became so attracted to the Nation of Islam. Rather than abandon the Black world he grew up in for anticipated riches, Clay sought dignity for himself and others. As a budding NOI devotee, Clay met Malcolm X, the group's national representative, who would become one his most important friends and mentors. Clay and Malcolm grew attracted to each other's hidden depths, rarely visible to the general public.\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" slows down the story of the young champion boxer's rise enough for us to see the risks - some would say reckless - the young Clay took in shaping his personal and professional destiny. Drawn to a religious group characterized by some mainstream journalists as \"Black supremacists\" held the potential to destroy Clay's boxing career, but he refused to back down, maintaining his religious faith as a protective shield against racist insults and threats.\n\nThe film also explores Ali's eventual rejection of Malcolm X in detail, offering one example of the way in which the champ's charisma and bravado at times concealed a gift for self-preservation that could be ruthless.\n\nWhile guiding Ali's evolution in his identity as a Black Muslim, Malcolm X was falling out with the leader of the National of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm broke with Muhammad in early 1964, announcing his plans to form his own organization. In May 1964 Ali toured Africa on a trip initially orchestrated by Malcolm, with whom he briefly reunited with in Accra, Ghana. Malcolm tried to greet him; with harsh words, Ali turned away. Their friendship ended there, to Ali's later regret , especially since Malcolm was killed the following year in a political assassination while giving a speech in New York.\n\nAs the film shows, Ali became, by his trip to Africa, a global symbol of Black pride. He embraced the NOI's racial separatism not out of weakness but from a position of strength. He basked in his growing celebrity, meeting with African leaders, wading through tremendous crowds and deepening his ties to a global Islamic community.\n\nAli's personal belief in Islam dovetailed with political convictions about the need to confront White supremacy, no matter the cost. \"Muhammad Ali\" illustrates how even as his significance to Black communities in the United States and abroad grew, Ali's charisma, bravado and humor curdled in the eyes of millions of White Americans as he strayed further from their idea of what a Black male athlete should be. Ali's refusal to fight in, or approve of, the Vietnam War turned him into a despised figure in mainstream America and burnished his stature as a countercultural icon.\n\nDenied status as a conscientious objector, hounded by a boxing commission's refusal to let him fight domestically, Ali fought overseas throughout 1966 before being stripped of his boxing license and heavyweight championship the next year, for refusing to be drafted into the army.\n\nSentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for resisting the draft in 1967 , Ali became an itinerant Black Power spokesperson, with the NOI distancing themselves from the former champ as he faced stiff political headwinds. In so doing, Ali became a model for Black resistance to systemic racism domestically and American imperialism abroad.\n\nThe fighter once so quick he could evade the blows of all of his opponents now discovered that he could take a punch, figuratively and literally. In the 1970s Ali engaged in a series of brutal matches, fighting Joe Frazier three times , and regaining the heavyweight championship in an upset victory over George Foreman in the \" Rumble in the Jungle \" in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nAli's professional redemption paralleled the rise of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in America. His popularity within the Black community spread into the mainstream and he became a kind of Rorschach test for the nation. His professional rivalry with Joe Frazier re-captivated the imagination of the predominantly White sports world. The film documents how Ali vilified Frazier as \"ugly\" and \"dumb,\" a man whose only admirer was conservative President Richard Nixon.

Yet he yearned for a personal dignity that he quickly realized could not be bought.\n\nClay found inspiration in the Nation of Islam; an encounter with a Nation of Islam member selling the newspaper, \"Muhammad Speaks,\" in Miami, where he trained for fights, piqued his curiosity about becoming a Muslim. Attending religious services at Miami's Temple No. 29 Mosque, where ministers preached that God was Black, showed Clay an alternate reality to the institutions of White supremacy normalized in his youth. Clay flourished, hearing a message of Black political and cultural self-determination that dovetailed with his own aspirations for enjoying a kind of personal dignity perpetually denied to African Americans.\n\nThe film provides a potent explanation to why Clay became so attracted to the Nation of Islam. Rather than abandon the Black world he grew up in for anticipated riches, Clay sought dignity for himself and others. As a budding NOI devotee, Clay met Malcolm X, the group's national representative, who would become one his most important friends and mentors. Clay and Malcolm grew attracted to each other's hidden depths, rarely visible to the general public.\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" slows down the story of the young champion boxer's rise enough for us to see the risks - some would say reckless - the young Clay took in shaping his personal and professional destiny. Drawn to a religious group characterized by some mainstream journalists as \"Black supremacists\" held the potential to destroy Clay's boxing career, but he refused to back down, maintaining his religious faith as a protective shield against racist insults and threats.\n\nThe film also explores Ali's eventual rejection of Malcolm X in detail, offering one example of the way in which the champ's charisma and bravado at times concealed a gift for self-preservation that could be ruthless.\n\nWhile guiding Ali's evolution in his identity as a Black Muslim, Malcolm X was falling out with the leader of the National of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm broke with Muhammad in early 1964, announcing his plans to form his own organization. In May 1964 Ali toured Africa on a trip initially orchestrated by Malcolm, with whom he briefly reunited with in Accra, Ghana. Malcolm tried to greet him; with harsh words, Ali turned away. Their friendship ended there, to Ali's later regret , especially since Malcolm was killed the following year in a political assassination while giving a speech in New York.\n\nAs the film shows, Ali became, by his trip to Africa, a global symbol of Black pride. He embraced the NOI's racial separatism not out of weakness but from a position of strength. He basked in his growing celebrity, meeting with African leaders, wading through tremendous crowds and deepening his ties to a global Islamic community.\n\nAli's personal belief in Islam dovetailed with political convictions about the need to confront White supremacy, no matter the cost. \"Muhammad Ali\" illustrates how even as his significance to Black communities in the United States and abroad grew, Ali's charisma, bravado and humor curdled in the eyes of millions of White Americans as he strayed further from their idea of what a Black male athlete should be. Ali's refusal to fight in, or approve of, the Vietnam War turned him into a despised figure in mainstream America and burnished his stature as a countercultural icon.\n\nDenied status as a conscientious objector, hounded by a boxing commission's refusal to let him fight domestically, Ali fought overseas throughout 1966 before being stripped of his boxing license and heavyweight championship the next year, for refusing to be drafted into the army.\n\nSentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for resisting the draft in 1967 , Ali became an itinerant Black Power spokesperson, with the NOI distancing themselves from the former champ as he faced stiff political headwinds. In so doing, Ali became a model for Black resistance to systemic racism domestically and American imperialism abroad.\n\nThe fighter once so quick he could evade the blows of all of his opponents now discovered that he could take a punch, figuratively and literally. In the 1970s Ali engaged in a series of brutal matches, fighting Joe Frazier three times , and regaining the heavyweight championship in an upset victory over George Foreman in the \" Rumble in the Jungle \" in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nAli's professional redemption paralleled the rise of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in America. His popularity within the Black community spread into the mainstream and he became a kind of Rorschach test for the nation. His professional rivalry with Joe Frazier re-captivated the imagination of the predominantly White sports world. The film documents how Ali vilified Frazier as \"ugly\" and \"dumb,\" a man whose only admirer was conservative President Richard Nixon.

Yet he yearned for a personal dignity that he quickly realized could not be bought.\n\nClay found inspiration in the Nation of Islam; an encounter with a Nation of Islam member selling the newspaper, \"Muhammad Speaks,\" in Miami, where he trained for fights, piqued his curiosity about becoming a Muslim. Attending religious services at Miami's Temple No. 29 Mosque, where ministers preached that God was Black, showed Clay an alternate reality to the institutions of White supremacy normalized in his youth. Clay flourished, hearing a message of Black political and cultural self-determination that dovetailed with his own aspirations for enjoying a kind of personal dignity perpetually denied to African Americans.\n\nThe film provides a potent explanation to why Clay became so attracted to the Nation of Islam. Rather than abandon the Black world he grew up in for anticipated riches, Clay sought dignity for himself and others. As a budding NOI devotee, Clay met Malcolm X, the group's national representative, who would become one his most important friends and mentors. Clay and Malcolm grew attracted to each other's hidden depths, rarely visible to the general public.\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" slows down the story of the young champion boxer's rise enough for us to see the risks - some would say reckless - the young Clay took in shaping his personal and professional destiny. Drawn to a religious group characterized by some mainstream journalists as \"Black supremacists\" held the potential to destroy Clay's boxing career, but he refused to back down, maintaining his religious faith as a protective shield against racist insults and threats.\n\nThe film also explores Ali's eventual rejection of Malcolm X in detail, offering one example of the way in which the champ's charisma and bravado at times concealed a gift for self-preservation that could be ruthless.\n\nWhile guiding Ali's evolution in his identity as a Black Muslim, Malcolm X was falling out with the leader of the National of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm broke with Muhammad in early 1964, announcing his plans to form his own organization. In May 1964 Ali toured Africa on a trip initially orchestrated by Malcolm, with whom he briefly reunited with in Accra, Ghana. Malcolm tried to greet him; with harsh words, Ali turned away. Their friendship ended there, to Ali's later regret , especially since Malcolm was killed the following year in a political assassination while giving a speech in New York.\n\nAs the film shows, Ali became, by his trip to Africa, a global symbol of Black pride. He embraced the NOI's racial separatism not out of weakness but from a position of strength. He basked in his growing celebrity, meeting with African leaders, wading through tremendous crowds and deepening his ties to a global Islamic community.\n\nAli's personal belief in Islam dovetailed with political convictions about the need to confront White supremacy, no matter the cost. \"Muhammad Ali\" illustrates how even as his significance to Black communities in the United States and abroad grew, Ali's charisma, bravado and humor curdled in the eyes of millions of White Americans as he strayed further from their idea of what a Black male athlete should be. Ali's refusal to fight in, or approve of, the Vietnam War turned him into a despised figure in mainstream America and burnished his stature as a countercultural icon.\n\nDenied status as a conscientious objector, hounded by a boxing commission's refusal to let him fight domestically, Ali fought overseas throughout 1966 before being stripped of his boxing license and heavyweight championship the next year, for refusing to be drafted into the army.\n\nSentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for resisting the draft in 1967 , Ali became an itinerant Black Power spokesperson, with the NOI distancing themselves from the former champ as he faced stiff political headwinds. In so doing, Ali became a model for Black resistance to systemic racism domestically and American imperialism abroad.\n\nThe fighter once so quick he could evade the blows of all of his opponents now discovered that he could take a punch, figuratively and literally. In the 1970s Ali engaged in a series of brutal matches, fighting Joe Frazier three times , and regaining the heavyweight championship in an upset victory over George Foreman in the \" Rumble in the Jungle \" in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nAli's professional redemption paralleled the rise of anti-Vietnam War sentiment in America. His popularity within the Black community spread into the mainstream and he became a kind of Rorschach test for the nation. His professional rivalry with Joe Frazier re-captivated the imagination of the predominantly White sports world. The film documents how Ali vilified Frazier as \"ugly\" and \"dumb,\" a man whose only admirer was conservative President Richard Nixon. In these and other instances the viewer gets detailed portraits of Ali's cruelty, casual at times, in service of his own ambition.\n\nIn defeat Ali became a figure who earned admiration and empathy. Losing to Frazier, as he did in front of millions on television and multiple celebrities in \"The Fight of the Century \" in 1971, humanized him in the eyes of White Americans and amplified the love Black folks held for him. He made disastrous financial decisions, supporting a gigantic entourage, giving money away to strangers and allowing the Nation of Islam to control his finances, as detailed in journalist Jonathan Eig's superb recent biography, \" Ali: A Life .\" The film also documents Ali's insatiable womanizing and the emotional trauma this inflicted on his wives and family\n\nPart of the heartbreak of Ali's story is his seemingly endless appetite for punishment and suffering. A promise to retire following his 1975 \"Thrilla in Manila\" - his final battle against Joe Frazier - faded until his last fight in 1981 , a sad beating at the hands of the unremarkable Trevor Berbick, which ended his boxing career for good. He emerged from his boxing career with a slower gait, halting speech and the symptoms of the Parkinson's diagnosis that would come in the 1980s.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\"Muhammad Ali\" restores so many of the beautiful and ugly parts of Ali's global legacy. For many Americans who came of age after Ali's boxing career was long over, the image they know of the icon is of a trembling man, lighting the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996. Now this film brings to life for those viewers the Ali who in his prime rejected an American Dream rooted in racial animus against Black people, who proudly adopted a Muslim name and projected an unapologetic pro-Blackness. His principled anti-war stance fulfilled Malcolm X's prediction that the young boxing champion from Louisville would become a symbol for millions of the world's dispossessed. Ali became an avatar of social and political change, not when he made it look easy in the ring, but when things got harder.\n\nAli's personal and political odyssey was an American epic, one that \"Muhammad Ali\" allows us all to experience.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

U.S. Supreme Court to consider Mississippi abortion ban designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. U.S. Supreme Court will also hear case involving Second Amendment rights this week. Supreme Court hears challenges to Texas abortion ban brought by providers and DOJ.\n\nARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: So, keep it right here, THE REIDOUT with Joy Reid starts now. Hi, Joy.\n\nJOY REID, MSNBC HOST: How are you doing, Ari. It's accurate. It is a moment, it is a movement and it's also a vibe. It's all accurate. Thank you very much. All right, have a great evening.\n\nMELBER: You too.\n\nREID: All right. Good evening, everyone. We have a lot to get to tonight, including stunning new details from a Washington Post investigation of the January 6th insurrection.\n\nPlus, we are just hours away from polls opening in Virginia, and Glenn Youngkin continues to fear-monger about critical race theory coming for your children.\n\nBut we begin THE REIDOUT tonight with the looming threat to abortion rights in America. Today was the first hit in what could ultimately be a one-two punch during this Supreme Court term, as the right-wing dominated high court heard challenges to the nation's most restrictive abortion law in Texas.\n\nThe justices heard two challenges to the Texas law known as SR-8, effectively banning abortion after six weeks. The plaintiffs argue the law has a chilling effect on abortion providers and putting it in the hands of private citizens and deputizing them as bounty hunters, the law allows the state to evade review by the course. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out the law seemed designed to do just that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, SUPREME COURT (voice over): The fact that after oh these many years, some geniuses came up with a way to evade the commands of that decision as well as the command that the broader -- the even broader principle states are not to nullify federal constitutional rights, and to say, oh, we've never seen this before so we can't do anything about it. I guess I just don't understand the argument.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: Justices heard arguments on behalf of Texas abortion providers and the Biden administration. And with respect to the abortion providers' arguments, the justices seemed skeptical about the way the law is written, including two of the court's most openly anti-abortion members, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT, SUPREME COURT (voice over): Even apart from these procedural requirements that you're talking about, I'm wondering if, in a defensive posture in state court, the constitutional defense can be fully aired.\n\nJUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT (voice over): Justice Kagan points out there is a loophole that's been exploited here, or used here, which is the private suits are enforced by state court clerks or judges. So, the question becomes should we extend the principal of Ex Parte Young to, in essence, close that loophole.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: But before you breathe any sighs of relief, consider two things. Number one, the court's right-wing majority allowed the Texas law to remain in effect while court considers these challenges. Meaning, Texas continues to be America's very own Gilead from The Handmaid's Tale. And number two, this is just a precursor to the second punch later this year, another abortion case coming down the road with even greater consequences.\n\nExactly one month from now on December 1st, the Supreme Court will hear arguments and challenge to Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. That case is designed to take direct aim at Roe v. Wade. Mississippi wants the court to overrule its 1992 decision in Casey that says that states cannot impose an undue burden on the right to abortion before viability. As of now, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 12 states have laws as 12 that would be triggered if the court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, immediately banning all or nearly all abortions.\n\nBut abortion rights is just one of the ways that this is shaping up to be a blockbuster term for the court. In two days, the justices will hear a challenge to a New York law imposing limits on carrying guns outside the home. It's the court's first Second Amendment case in more than a decade.\n\nAnd joining me now is Marc Hearron, Senior Counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights who represented Texas abortion clinics and providers who were challenging the Texas law at the Supreme Court today, Maya Wiley, MSNBC Legal Analyst, and Elie Mystal, Justice Correspondent for The Nation. Thank you all for being here.\n\nMr. Hearron, I want to go to you first. Surprisingly, it seems like there is a little bit agreement across the right to left isle on the court. Did you get the sense that the justices' unbalance, most of them were skeptical of the Texas law.\n\nMARC HEARRON, SENIOR COUNSEL, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: Well, Joy, thanks for having. I think, finally, we're getting some justices and is heartening to hear that we're getting the argument that we've been making all along, which although SB-8 is about abortion, it has stopped the provision of abortion here 62 days across the state of Texas right now.\n\nThis case is really when you take a step back and look at it from a broader standpoint, it's whether a state can just decide I'm going to ignore Supreme Court decision.\n\n[19:05:05]\n\nThe Supreme Court decision recognizes a constitutional right can be -- become a dead letter in my state and a state can just allow, you know, anybody and everybody to sue for $10,000, $1 million in Chief Justice Roberts' questions.\n\nAnd it's heartening to hear that finally some justices are recognizing that it's -- you know, abortions at stake but tomorrow it could be every other single right that's recognized in the bill of rights that's at stake if a state can simply decide, you know, Supreme Court decisions don't carry any weight in our state anymore.\n\nREID: Yes. You know, Maya, I mean, what good is having a right if you're too afraid to use it, right? I mean, the purpose of this law was to make people too afraid to assist anyone to attempt to get an abortion themselves and just to sort of frighten abortion away, right, and make it so that it was impossible to really use the right. Do you get the sense that the fact that the Supreme Court allowed the law to be implemented while they make the decision indicates anything about where you think they might go?\n\nMAYA WILEY, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's a big concern because, as you said, Joy, where there is no remedy, as we say as lawyers, there is no right. And so if you essentially say, we're going to allow a law to stand, that is patently and obviously and clearly and explicitly about making it too scary for providers to actually deliver the services that women are constitutionally allowed to get under existing law, that that -- but you can't come to court. You essentially can't come to the Supreme Court. You can't come and get it vindicated and we won't stop the case.\n\nAnd in order to make the decision about whether or not you can, that was a huge, huge concern to all of us. I think your point is right that, you know, it is important to see the two justices are changing their minds so that maybe that meant they truly were kind of tied up in these procedural arguments about what it meant and whether or not they can step in and who would you actually say no you can't do that.\n\nBut, you know, I think the problem with the entire argument from my standpoint was the fact that because it's controversial, because we're talking about whether Casey is going to remain the law of the land, the basis that the Supreme Court said, if you just make it too hard to get an abortion, you already violated the constitutional rights of women, that you've essentially said, well, okay, we've made it so hard, in fact, we know it's so hard because 85 percent of women now can't get one. It has worked and we're not having any conversation about that. And on December 1, we're going to decide whether Casey is still the law of the land.\n\nREID: You know, and, Elie, it seems like the court sort of treated this law like they treated death penalty. You know, like the person has got to die and the way they treated voting rights, like, I guess if we make it too hard for people to vote, oh, well, sorry for you, like that seems to be kind of the way that they're operating.\n\nBut there was this sort of argument. I'm not going to play it. But just Kavanaugh, good ol' Kavanaugh, suggesting that maybe one way they might turn against the law is that they fear the law might be retrofitted to be used against guns. That was kind of the argument he made. He's like maybe we better hold our horses before they come for the guns with the same kind of strategy. What did you make of the arguments today?\n\nELIE MYSTAL, JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, THE NATION: We got Kavanaugh, I believe, because he did not understand how the uterus works but he understands how guns work. And people were able to make the case to him, that the same thing that people are using against these uteruses, that he doesn't understand, they can use against the gun and made Kavanaugh stood up and say, wait a minute now, we can't have that.\n\nLook, I don't want to be the spit in the punch bowl. This was generally good. I do think Coney Barrett and Kavanaugh will eventually overturn SB-8 but that's because SB-8 is bonkers. Like SB-8 has always been this clown side show of a crazy rule that was never going to stand the test of time because, as we've expressed, you can't have a society if people can just overturn constitutional principles as they want by hiring bounty hunters. SB-8 was never the way that they were going to overturn abortion (INAUDIBLE) on women's health.\n\nThe December 1st case was always their preferred way of taking away rights and I've heard nothing today to suggest the people that Donald Trump appointed, that he promised would be anti-abortion. I heard nothing today to suggest that they have changed their minds in any significant way about the overall rights of a woman to choose.\n\nThis bonkers SB-8 argument, yes, I think that will eventually go down, although not today. Because let's not forget the other part of what happened today was a question about whether or not they will overturn SB-8 now or wait six months to do it and I don't know that there was a lot of movement in terms of stopping it right now.\n\n[19:10:03]\n\nBut, eventually, SB-8 will go away. It is the larger issue about a women's right to choose that it's still very much on the top of mind.\n\nREID: Right. I mean, Mr. Hearron, here are some of the greater reports that abortions fell by half in the first month of this abortion ban, 50 percent fewer. The law is already having the intended effect. So, it's hard to imagine that no matter how this goes, the ultimate ruling, that, you know, conservatives aren't just going to step on the gas and try another sort of similarly clever means of getting what they want.\n\nHEARRON: Yes. I mean, this year, this legislative year has been the worst year in history for abortion rights that state legislatures are emboldened passing restriction after restriction after restriction, making abortion access harder and harder to reach. And what's happening when you see happening right now in the state of Texas, it's not only that people are being denied their right to access abortion but now because there is such a rush to get access outside of the state of Texas, it's affecting patients outside of the state of Texas in Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nPeople are being delayed by weeks because of the Texas law. 10 percent of people of reproductive age live in Texas. And so this is a crisis and it's time. It is way past time. This law has been in effect for two months. People have been denied their constitutional rights for two months. It is past time we need this law to be blocked and it needs to be blocked immediately.\n\nAnd the other thing I want to point out, you know, I heard something I thought incredibly remarkable today. The state of Texas actually said to the Supreme Court that after Brown versus the Board of Education, if a state had just passed a law like SB-8 to say, you know, anybody can sue somebody who integrates a school and federal courts can do nothing about it.\n\nThat is not the kind of constitutional democracy that we live in. This is - - that is not our republic and that cannot be -- you know, that's not the rule of law. The federal courts have got to be able to weigh in here.\n\nREID: That's exactly -- you know, nightmare with me for a minute. Because -- right, once the right has found this technique, they could use it in almost anything, whether they want to go after voting rights or integrated schools. Pretty much, you'll be able to sue anybody but a police officer that killed a family member.\n\nWILEY: Well, that's exactly right and, you know, Justice Breyer made that point. He said, so if we were in 1957 Alabama, you know, we and we had a state that said, you know what, we the state won't stop little black children from integrating white schools, we'll just deputize our residents to sue anybody who walks through that door, isn't that what you're saying? And that just put the pin in it, I think, quite directly.\n\nEven if the Texas law gave people $1 million for suing people to block their constitutional rights even when they are not harmed in any way, let's be clear, anybody, any stranger off the street can say, oh, hey, I'd love to make $10,000 and I won't even have to pay any lawyers because I'll get my legal fees. I'm going to court. I mean, that is the kind of constitutional lawlessness that we fought a civil war over and I say that because what we were hearing from Texas today was state's rights (ph), plain and simple, there is a republic, there is no federal -- there is constitutional. No one can tell us what to do.\n\nREID: And it feels, Elie, like that's where this is going. The South Africa model feels like it's fully in effect. And regardless of how they rule in this particular law, I feel like this Supreme Court, the majority of them anyway, are down with that future.\n\nMYSTAL: I mean, let's -- again, let's look at, really, the full scope of what they were arguing today. There was an actual argument from Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito, arguing that the move to control women's bodies in this way was no different than the move to force masks on people during a pandemic, like they've actually made a one-to-one connection between mask mandates and taking away abortion rights. So, that's at least, you know, two or three justices on the court are all the way over to the right in terms of their crazy and nothing seems to be happening to pull them back to the center.\n\nThis is a generational problem that we have that has come about because we let Mitch McConnell steal a couple of Supreme Court seats and now we have to deal with this for a generation unless Democrats do something to reform the court.\n\nREID: And, once again, it brings us right back to the reform of the court argument because, you're right, it's the only way out of this nightmare.\n\n[19:15:00]\n\nMarc Hearron, Maya Wiley, Elie Mystal, thank you all very much.\n\nUp next on THE REIDOUT, the plot to overthrow democracy, new details on the warnings of violence leading up to January 6th and the pressure placed on Mike Pence to, quote, show courage and spine to keep Trump in office.\n\nAlso, down to the wire in Virginia, the test of whether the Republicans' racist lies about critical race theory, which is not taught in any Virginia school, is actually a winning message for the party of Trump.\n\nPlus, the widow of a slain pastor of Charleston's Mother Emanuel AME Church joins me on the landmark settlement with the Department of Justice.\n\nAnd tonight's absolute worst, the alarming lack of urgency as the world literally burns.\n\nTHE REIDOUT continues after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nREID: NBC News today reports that the select committee on January 6th is expected to subpoena John Eastman, the legal architect of Trump's attempted coup, by the middle of this week.\n\n[19:20:02]\n\nIt comes after \"The Washington Post\" reported that Eastman e-mailed Vice President Mike Pence's team during the insurrection, while Pence was hiding from the mob that was out to kill him. And, unbelievably, Eastman blamed the violence on Pence his refusal to overturn the election.\n\nHe wrote a top Pence aide, saying: \"This siege is because you and your boss did not do what was necessary.\"\n\nYesterday, \"The Washington Post\" also released a comprehensive investigative report on the genesis and aftermath of the insurrection, and uncovered a cascade of previously undisclosed warnings that preceded the attack, noting that Trump was the driving force at every turn.\n\nAmong other things, \"The Post\" points out that, as early as September 26 of last year, Trump was aware that Congress could play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the election.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want to go back to Congress either, even though we have an advantage if we go back to Congress. Does everyone understand that?\n\nI think it's 26 to 22 or something, because it's counted one vote per state.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: It was just three days later that Trump during a presidential debate ominously told the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by.\n\nBut it wasn't just right-wing militias that answered his call to arms. As \"The Post\" reports, researchers watched how Trump's election lies radicalized his supporters in real time. And when Trump turned his focus to the joint session of Congress on January 6, the volume of threatening messages expanded by the hour.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the nation's regional homeland security offices were blinking red. The hour, date and location of concern was the same, 1:00 p.m., the U.S. Capitol, January 6. One DHS official even called D.C.'s Health Department and urged them to prepare for a mass casualty event.\n\nTo sum it up, it's damning new evidence of the security failures that day. But, moreover, it highlights the undeniable fact that Trump was responsible for the violence that unfolded. And yet, for 187 minutes, as his followers laid siege to the Capitol, Trump did nothing.\n\nIn fact, he even -- he didn't even report to the Oval Office. He was holed up instead in his private dining room as the crisis played out.\n\nJoining me now is Olivia Troye, former senior aide to Vice President Pence and director of the Republican Accountability Project.\n\nAnd, Olivia, there was lots and lots in this very lengthy \"Washington Post\" report, including reports that Senator Lindsey Graham yelled at the sergeant of arms: \"What are you doing? Take back the Senate. You have got guns. Use them.\" He wanted them to start shooting at these insurrectionists.\n\nWhat do you take away from this sort of accumulation of information, the fact that there were all of these blinking red warnings that were just not listened to, quite frankly, all the way -- all the way through Donald Trump's absence, I guess, is another way to -- the only way to put it, sort of AWOL status that day?\n\nOLIVIA TROYE, FORMER U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIAL: I think it's incredulous, looking at the reporting, the in-depth-ness of this situation, and just contrasting that with the behavior of current Republican leaders today, where they continue to try to memory hole this.\n\nI mean, this is just so striking, right, 187 minutes, where the president of the United States at the time sat, watched the Capitol be attacked, watched lives, people get hurt, lives lost, watched leaders of our country fear for their lives and just sat there and did nothing.\n\nAnd this is a man who still holds the Republicans hostage today. They still bow down to him. They still kiss the ring. There are many candidates out there who refused to denounce him. There are candidates out there that are seeking his endorsement, as we go forward to elections.\n\nAnd so, when I look at this, I think that is what you're subscribing to, this type of individual who, on the darkest day of our country on that day, did absolutely nothing for our country, to protect it, to protect our democracy. And this is the person, this is the person that everyone's rallying around. This is the person that Youngkin still hasn't denounced him. We have an election tomorrow.\n\nAnd, by the way, some of these people who were organizing this rally, they're tweeting out today about the elections that are taking place tomorrow. They are already tweeting out conspiracies and lies about it. And we have seen what that leads to. We have seen the type of violence that that can lead to, when they push these lies.\n\nAnd that is what I have fear is, going forward, what this all means. We have seen all this play out. So we can't move on from this, because it matters so much. It matters so much for the future.\n\nAnd as I read this, that's all that kept going through my head and just -- it's just so astounding to think about this, the greater picture.\n\nREID: And, just as a contrast, I mean, you have Donald Trump trying to hide documents, trying to keep the select committee from finding out documents.\n\nAnd when you read through this piece in \"The Washington Post,\" you kind of understand why, because even before for the election happened, he was saying, hey, maybe we could use Congress as a way to -- regardless of how things go to keep me in office, all the way through watching it happen.\n\n[19:25:10]\n\nIt does feel that, at every turn, Donald Trump was the person who was goading, pushing, and inspiring people to commit violence, anything to stay in power. It's hard to get around that, no?\n\nTROYE: Absolutely.\n\nHe was the commander in chief of this entire insurrection. He incited it. And, look, when you're the president, words matter. When you're a leader, words matter. And seeing the reporting about the followers and supporters saying that he's -- it's a call to action, he's called them to action, he didn't tell them to bring the guns because he can't actually say it, but he's telling them to bring the guns, that's how they're interpreting this.\n\nThey're interpreting this message. And so a lot of these people use this as a double entendre when they speak. We were watching elected officials, when they speak with such violence, when they put violence in their -- in their -- the ads on social media right now. All of that matters because it's processed by and supported by the people that follow them.\n\nAnd they take that in. And from a national security standpoint, this is all remains just very concerning.\n\nREID: Let's play a tale of two Republicans here. This is Matt Gaetz yesterday, who we should remind folks is being investigated for potential trafficking of a 17-year-old girl, but is not embarrassed at all. He's still out there talking.\n\nHere he is saying that he thinks that he'd like to see the metal detectors at the Capitol blown up.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I said, man, is it Tannerite or C4 we want to put in those metal detectors when we blow them up?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: Tannerite is basically like C4.\n\nI mean, this feels like fifth column activity inside the Republican Party. You have something called the Republican Accountability Project. You're a former Republican that is now fighting what used to be your party. It does feel like they're all insurrection, race-scaremongering, and really gearing up to never accept the results of an election unless one of them wins it.\n\nTROYE: This is who they are. There's no room for the truth.\n\nThat's why you see people like Adam Kinzinger saying that he's going to continue to uphold the fight and fight from outside now. He's not a part of this anymore. There's no room for people like Liz Cheney right now. Look at the way they have treated her.\n\nSo this is the Republican Party. And anyone who is thinking otherwise is delusional. They're not living in reality. And so I am concerned about going forward what this means for our future as a country to have a party like this that continues to behave in this manner, because it's fundamentally just dangerous.\n\nAnd I think we have one functioning party right now. And I think we have to do everything we can to sort of support people who are rational, people who are actually trying to govern and push policies that make a difference in our country.\n\nREID: It's a scary time.\n\nWe say scaring is caring a lot on this show, but there's no way around it. It is pretty frightening to have that element inside of one of our formerly great Republican -- great political parties in America.\n\nOlivia Troye, thank you very much. Really appreciate you.\n\nAll right, still ahead: It is election eve, as you just heard, and candidates are making their final pitches to voters. In the Virginia governor's race, that means Republican Glenn Trumpkin is misquoting Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his bid to put racial division and culture wars front and center.\n\nThe latest next. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[19:32:53]\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGLENN YOUNGKIN (R), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: In the immortal words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we're called to judge one another based on the content of our character and not the color of our skin.\n\nAnd that's why there's no place for Critical Race Theory in our school system and why, on day one, I'm going to ban it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: Literally the only quote they know.\n\nGlenn Youngkin's closing argument to Virginia voters included the latest form of Republican gaslighting, pimping the one Martin Luther King Jr. quote that they can remember, while vowing to erase everything Dr. King stood for from the history books.\n\nJoining me now, Don Calloway, Democratic strategist and founder of the National Voter Protection Action Fund, and Charlie Sykes, editor at large of The Bulwark.\n\nThis is the closing argument. Obviously, this is the way they want to go.\n\nAnd, Don, the reason that this kind of works is that they don't really have to make an argument about what's actually in the schools. They can just get people to feel a certain way. And it's the feeling -- Republicans are really good at running on just feelings, not policy.\n\nDON CALLOWAY, FOUNDER, NATIONAL VOTER PROTECTION ACTION FUND: Yes.\n\nREID: But just: This feels weird to me. I don't like it. And therefore, I'm going to vote Republican.\n\nI want to play -- this is a thing called The Good Liars. They're like a comedy troupe, I guess a comedy sort of video kind of -- I don't know what they are, actually. They are like -- they do comedy, but they go out and they interview people, and they do sort of real-world interviews.\n\nHere they are interviewing someone in Virginia, one of them.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is Critical Race Theory?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm not going to get into the specifics of it, because I don't understand it that much. But it's something that I don't -- what little bit that I know, I don't care for.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what have you heard that you don't like?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm not going to -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't have that much knowledge on it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: And just for context, Don, the actual original question was, what's the most important issue in this race? And the gentleman said Critical Race Theory.\n\nSo, Republicans have managed to turn this thing that -- I call it Christopher Rufo theory. You can call whatever you want. They made up a thing that feel -- that makes people feel a certain way. And so far it's working for them in a certain level, right?\n\nCALLOWAY: It is. It is.\n\nWell, first of all, to Glenn Youngkin's despicable twisting of Dr. King's words, actually, he says them -- not twist them, but he says them out of context. As my brother the great Reverend Dr. Starsky Wilson says, we should never allow ourselves to be disavowed of the notion of a radically- justice-based Dr. King.\n\n[19:35:17]\n\nAnd that's ultimately who he was. That's ultimately why he was killed. We should never allow ourselves to forget that.\n\nBut Critical Race Theory is -- I mean, and we have seen it evolve into this discussion of parental rights or parents' rights in the school context. They're ultimately talking about Critical Race Theory as an avatar for white fragility and white rights, right, to not have to acknowledge systemic racism, to not have to even teach in schools on the history of white supremacy and how it's baked into the fabric of this country.\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, particularly unfortunately for Terry McAuliffe, he has allowed Glenn Youngkin, to grab onto this sliver, this minor shade of truth, and run it for the last 60 days of this campaign, because of a perhaps less-than-careful moment that Terry McAuliffe had in a primary and -- excuse me -- in the primary debates.\n\nAnd it's gotten this far, and we hope that he's not able to take advantage of low Democratic turnout and a sleepy electorate to run it this far.\n\nBut, to be clear, this discussion of parental rights, ultimately, this discussion of Critical Race Theory is not only a gross misunderstanding of what the academic definition and the academic discipline, Derrick Bell's academic discipline of Critical Race Theory is, but it is an intentional misconstruing, which has misled these fundamentally kind of white male rural voters into believing that angry Malcolmian black supremacists are going to take over public schools. And it's not.\n\nUnfortunately -- and I will end with this -- Republican strategists know that. But they know how to tap into that deep ethereal white fragility. And it's so sad that it's working five miles from where I live.\n\nREID: And, Charlie, I think that the twisting of Dr. King actually demonstrates how Republicans have done this so well.\n\nThey have taken somebody who was absolutely despised and thought of as a radical and dangerous communist when he was alive, and they have turned him into a greeting card that says, nobody's ever bad, nothing's ever bad, everything is fine. Everyone just -- we just need to all talk about how good everyone is.\n\nThey have taken his whole career and distilled it down to that one quote that they can remember, content of our character. And they don't understand anything about Dr. King, just like they don't under -- you know what I mean? You don't have to know anything about Dr. King.\n\nYou just have to memorize that one line. And then everything that makes you feel like anybody white is -- that you're saying that white people weren't like great all throughout history, ah, ah, ah, I will throw King at you.\n\nAnd I think they have done that really well with a lot of these issues. It's just a feelings-based kind of strategy. But I'm not sure that Democrats have ever figured out -- whether it was Reagan doing it with welfare, whether it's now, I'm not sure Democrats have figured out how to respond to it.\n\nCHARLIE SYKES, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: No, and we're going to find that out tomorrow in Virginia.\n\nYou mentioned the name Christopher Rufo. And I just kind of wanted to put a pin in all of that, because, of course, he is one of the theorists and the activists who's been pushing this.\n\nAnd then he's been very, very transparent about his agenda that he wants people to pay -- I think he actually tweeted out that he wants people to pick up the newspaper and see something that makes them uncomfortable and immediately think Critical Race Theory.\n\nREID: That's right.\n\nSYKES: So anything involving race that they do not understand or that they might find questionable, you have labeled a Critical Race Theory.\n\nAnd I'm glad you played that clip, because I was actually going to mention that clip. You could have that same interview with legislators all around the country who are voting to ban Critical Race Theory.\n\nREID: That's right.\n\nSYKES: What exactly is Critical Race Theory? Could you show me an example of Critical Race Theory in any public school in your state?\n\nIn Wisconsin, the Republican legislature has not only passed a ban on Critical Race Theory. They have actually come up with a list of words that are actually banned that you cannot use, terms like multiculturalism and social justice.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nSYKES: So, it would be interesting if somebody would have gone back at Mr. Youngkin and said, you're quoting Martin Luther King Jr., but you're going to ban what you call Critical Race Theory.\n\nUnder your ban, would you actually be able to teach about Martin Luther King?\n\nREID: You would not.\n\nSYKES: Would you be able to have a curriculum that would include his letters from the jail...\n\nREID: You could not.\n\nSYKES: ... or the entire speech, rather than just the excerpt?\n\nBecause I'm guessing that somebody is going to stand up and say, well, that makes me feel uncomfortable. This must be Critical Race Theory.\n\nREID: Exactly.\n\nAnd, I mean, the thing is, he gave speeches about America may go to hell. You -- probably, you cannot teach that, because so -- and I want to stay with it just for a moment, because I do think -- I want to stay with you for a second, Charlie.\n\nThe Tomahawk Chop, can we show this? Trump did it at the Major League Baseball game, at the World Series game. He and his wife did it. The governor of Georgia did it. They're all participating in this. It's the same kind of thing.\n\n[19:40:06]\n\nThere is this sense among some white Americans, not all, but some, that you don't -- that they aren't allowed to do or say what they want because some minority group is going to be offended. And it is that. That's what Critical Race Theory is to them, that I don't get to say the jokes I want to say, say the memes I want to say, do the Tomahawk Chop. People get mad? And I don't like that.\n\nThat is what they're legislating against, no?\n\nSYKES: Right.\n\nAnd they like that sort of transgressive behavior. We have to point that Major League Baseball...\n\nREID: They do. They like offending people.\n\nSYKES: Yes.\n\nRemember when Major League Baseball actually boycotted the state of Georgia because of its restrictive voting law? And, of course, Major League Baseball is there -- is back in a big way with the World Series, and they invite Donald Trump to come and do the Tomahawk Chop, so speaking of hypocrisy.\n\nBut you're absolutely right. I mean, what someone like Donald Trump does is, he gives permission to people to engage in behavior...\n\nREID: Yes, be your worst self.\n\nSYKES: ... that maybe we were at the point of questioning.\n\nREID: That's right.\n\nSYKES: And so I do think that you need to see this in the context of a new white backlash, the kind of thing that we saw, as you have pointed out on this show over and over again, of Reconstruction.\n\nREID: Yes. Yes.\n\nSYKES: And this is basically just the fill-in for the term that they use to provide them the context.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nREID: Absolutely. And they don't want to be reconstructed. They say, I want to be my worst self, and I want you to accept it, and I don't care. That's what they want. And that to them is what Critical Race Theory means.\n\nDon Calloway, Charlie Sykes, thank you all very much.\n\nUp next: a historic settlement in the 2015 massacre of the Mother -- at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[19:45:47]\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJENNIFER PINCKNEY, WIDOW OF REVEREND CLEMENTA PINCKNEY: I still relive and I still think about what happened being there.\n\nI will remember it until the day I die. And so I live with it every day. Yes, there is a settlement. And I don't think about that. I think about, if I had the opportunity to bring Clementa back, I'd switch. You can all take the settlement. Bring my husband back me. Bring their father back to them.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: It's been more than six years since nine people were shot and killed in the horrific massacre at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nAfter it was revealed that the FBI's background check system failed to catch a previous felony drug arrest that should have blocked the sale of the gun that was used by the 21-year-old white supremacist, the families of the victims sued.\n\nOn Thursday, the Justice Department announced an $88 million settlement with the families of the victims and survivors. One of the attorneys for the victims calls it one of the largest settlements in a collection of civil rights cases in the nation's history.\n\nAnd joining me now is Jennifer Pinckney, who survived the shooting and is the widow of the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, also the family's attorney, Gerald Malloy, who's a South Carolina state senator who served with Reverend Pinckney.\n\nThank you both for being here.\n\nPINCKNEY: Thank you.\n\nSo we just saw a clip of you saying you would throw the settlement aside and have your husband back.\n\nAnd I hate to take you back to this day. But you were there. You are not just widow of a victim. You, yourself, were a victim. You and your daughter were there.\n\nPINCKNEY: Yes.\n\nREID: So this is really big for you.\n\nPINCKNEY: It is. It is.\n\nWe were there. And it's something that I will always remember for the rest of my life, sitting in the office, and the bullets coming through, and trying to protect my daughter. It was something that I will always remember for the rest of my life.\n\nREID: She was a little girl. She was -- I think she was, what, 12, 11? She was 11 years old.\n\nPINCKNEY: She was 6.\n\nREID: She was 6 years old. She's 11 now.\n\nPINCKNEY: She's 12 now.\n\nREID: Does she talk about it at all?\n\nPINCKNEY: No, she doesn't. She doesn't.\n\nNow, with both of my girls, they will -- we will talk about their father and daddy this, daddy that, and just spring up different things he used to say and do and so forth. But as far as just her bringing up that particular day, no, she doesn't.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nAnd, Senator, you served with Clementa Pinckney. You talked about his last words...\n\nSTATE SEN. GERALD MALLOY (D-SC): Yes, well...\n\nREID: ... on the Senate floor.\n\nMALLOY: On the Senate floor, where Clementa had gave a wonderful speech on body cameras.\n\nAnd what he did was to say -- it was after the murder of Walter Scott. And then, in the end, he said: God teaches us to love all of it. And, in the end, justice will be done.\n\nAnd that's one of the best speeches you would ever hear from the Senate floor, and it was somewhat prophetic. Clementa was an absolute terrific person. He called himself an itinerant pastor. Any time that there was something going on with the church or a church member, and there was something in the Senate, he was a pastor first.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nAnd when you -- when I think about those, those final words, Mrs. Pinckney, I remember a pastor, not from South Carolina, saying to me black folks are always expected to have amazing grace. No matter what we suffer, no matter how much we're hurting, we're supposed to have grace.\n\nAnd I remember a lot of media people asking the victims of the Charleston nine, the family members, do you forgive?\n\nBut I want to ask you if you -- if you're still angry. I mean, the state of South Carolina obviously failed you. This court has now said they failed you. Are you still angry about that?\n\nPINCKNEY: You can't be angry.\n\nThat's something that, if you hold that in, you can't move forward.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nPINCKNEY: And so you have to be able to -- you never forget. You will always remember.\n\nAnd I will always be there to talk to my girls and tell them and other people what happened and so forth as from my standpoint. But that's something that you just never forget.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nAnd let's talk about this specific settlement, $88 million. That is significant, because, for those who are not familiar with white nationalists and white supremacists, they use 88 for heil Hitler. That is their symbol.\n\n[19:50:07]\n\nAnd so that -- that's a very significant settlement amount. Talk about what that means.\n\nMALLOY: Well, on the day of the -- reaching the settlement, it really didn't cross my mind. We were trying to do the best that we could for these families, because they have suffered so much and given so much.\n\nBut during the evaluation, what we have is that we have a civil case. We had been in mediation for the better part of two days jockeying back and forth. It wasn't easy. And so then, at the very end, when we got to a point and say, this is the number, then someone says, there's somebody else's hands that's touching. This is the hands of God.\n\nThere's something going on here, because, in the end, not to be cute about it, would you have taken 100 instead? Of course. But what happened was is that that was the number. And we had a discussion about it. And then the question was, he said, do we need to change it from $1 off or $1 less, $1 more or something?\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: And then someone said, you know what, let's take it back. Let's make that number mean something.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: When it meant something to someone else, when they use it as a racist symbol, let's take it back and make it a symbol of pride.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: This is something that -- where we were trying to right a wrong.\n\nAnd hats off to Attorney General Merrick Garland for his compassion, for his emphasis on civil rights, and all the work of all the lawyers that were involved on both sides. Vanita Gupta was tremendous in this work. We had Bakari Sellers that came in to help broker part of the deal. Had some wonderful lawyers like Alvin Hammer and Mullins McLeod others that worked really hard on this case.\n\nSo it was a come-togetherness at that time. So that number came in. And, right now, that number means something else to us...\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nMALLOY: ... than the number of bullets that Dylann Roof into the church, 88 bullets. He used 77 and seven magazines. The 88 that he inscribed on his shoe.\n\nAnd so it meant something to him. This will mean something else for others, is that this is a just result.\n\nREID: And, Mrs. Pinckney, you had a chance to meet with the attorney general. Would you share with us some of what he said to the families?\n\nPINCKNEY: He was just very compassionate.\n\nIt almost looked like he had tears in his eyes. I mean, he was like: I know this doesn't bring your family member back. But it was something that we had to do.\n\nREID: Yes.\n\nWell, I want to just say that we have deepest condolences to your family, you and your girls for your loss.\n\nAnd I want to congratulate you all, as the attorneys who made this settlement happen. This is justice, in a way. As you said, it's not going to bring back your loved ones.\n\nBut, Jennifer Pinckney, state Senator Gerald Malloy, thank you both very much.\n\nPINCKNEY: Thank you.\n\nREID: Really appreciate you both.\n\nMALLOY: Thank you.\n\nREID: All right, and don't go anywhere.\n\nTonight's \"Absolute Worst\" affects every single person on this planet. And we are quickly running out of time to do something about it.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[19:57:18]\n\nREID: While we are sitting here right now, the planet we live on is dying.\n\nThis year, the U.S. has seen 18 weather disasters that have killed more than 500 people, costing taxpayers more than a billion dollars. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which studies this stuff, nearly half the country has been subjected to a devastating climate event.\n\nThere have been forest fires in California and Nevada, extreme droughts in California, Oregon, Utah, Montana, and North Dakota, severe weather in Texas and Oklahoma, flooding in Louisiana, which gutted thousands of homes, devastating tornadoes in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, tropical storms up and down the Eastern Seaboard that left Florida homes bombarded and New York City subway stations submerged, which, needless to say, is not supposed to happen.\n\nAnd that's just what's happening here in the U.S. Around the world, the number of climate-related disasters has tripled in the last 50 years, tripled. Extraordinarily hot and cold temperatures are responsible for five million deaths every year. That's about how many people have died around the world from COVID.\n\nClimate collapse is taking the equivalent number of lives every single year. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that warned us that, if humans don't get their acts together and drastically -- and I mean drastically -- cut carbon emissions in the next 12 years, we will have irreversibly worse droughts, flooding, extreme heat and climate-induced poverty.\n\nThat was three years ago. And even with current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we're on track to see temperatures rise by nearly 3 degrees Celsius this century. In layman's terms, this Earth could eventually become unlivable.\n\nToday, world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP 26 climate summit, where delegates called for accelerated action.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: Enough of treating nature like a toilet. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.\n\nBORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The longer we fail to act, the worse it gets, and the higher the price when we are eventually forced by catastrophe to act.\n\nMIA MOTTLEY, PRIME MINISTER OF BARBADOS: We act in the interest of all of our people, who are dependent on us. And if we don't, we will allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: President Biden, who's trying to reverse the damage done by his predecessor and the Republican Party, made an appeal of his own.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases.\n\nGod bless you all, and may God save the planet.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREID: I'm glad he said that, because it's going to take a miracle to turn this planet around.\n\nSo, tonight, the lack of global outrage and action when it comes to the demise of the only planet we have got is the \"Absolute Worst.\"\n\nAnd that's tonight's REIDOUT.\n\n\"ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES\" starts now.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

But are federal agencies hampering anti-terrorism efforts by failing to report basic data?\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST: One year ago, the Biden administration launched the first national plan to counter domestic extremism. It aims to address what top national security officials say is one of the most significant threats to the country. That threat earned renewed focus only a few weeks ago, when a white gunman shot 10 Black people in a racist attack at a Buffalo grocery store. He has now been charged with a federal hate crime. But even with heightened federal attention on the issue, lawmakers and counterterrorism experts say they lack a critical component - data. NPR's Odette Yousef covers domestic extremism and joins us now. Good morning, Odette. ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: All right. So officials are saying they lack data. What exactly is missing? YOUSEF: Well, Rachel, before I can answer that, let me give you some context. Last week, at least two Senate committees held hearings focusing on domestic extremism and what can be done to prevent another tragic attack like what happened in Buffalo. But what emerged was a really deep partisan divide over how law enforcement should identify and go after threats. You know, Republicans were largely pushing back against focusing exclusively on white supremacist violence, suggesting that it's just as bad from actors on the far left. And it seems that this disagreement might be overcome if they could just agree on the numbers, you know, but lawmakers on both sides complained that they haven't been getting the numbers. They're supposed to get, you know, annual reports on domestic terrorism from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. Those reports have been delayed. And when I contacted those agencies, neither explained the delays or said when the latest report would come out. MARTIN: But haven't we heard both the FBI and Homeland Security point to the threat from white supremacists as a priority? YOUSEF: Yes. You know, DHS officials have said white supremacist extremists are the most persistent and lethal threat in the U.S. The FBI says most of their caseload when it comes to racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism involves white supremacy. But one of the issues is that the FBI has changed how they categorize the data. During the Trump era, the agency collapsed classifications of political or ideological motivators of domestic terrorism from roughly a dozen down to just five, and one of those is racially or ethnically motivated violence. But, Rachel, that means that you're now rolling together, you know, both white supremacists and violent Black supremacists into a single category. MARTIN: OK. So explain why that matters. YOUSEF: Well, counterterrorism experts like Michael German say that this leaves federal agencies with tremendous discretion over where they direct their resources. He's with the Brennan Center for Justice. And here's some of his congressional testimony from last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL GERMAN: I think Portland, Ore., is a good example, where the federal government charged almost a hundred people during the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd. But groups from outside of Oregon were traveling in far-right militant groups, like the Proud Boys, were coming into Oregon and instigating violence and committing violence on the street with very little law enforcement interference. YOUSEF: And German said that, in turn, allowed the Proud Boys to continue building their network and organization, Rachel, ultimately to lay the groundwork for their involvement in the January 6 attack at the Capitol. And even though violent white supremacists currently present the most lethal and persistent domestic terrorism threat, you know, that threat changes over time. And so having consistent and timely data can allow federal agencies to be more nimble and accountable when it comes to responding to the evolving threat. MARTIN: NPR's Odette Yousef.

They're supposed to get, you know, annual reports on domestic terrorism from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. Those reports have been delayed. And when I contacted those agencies, neither explained the delays or said when the latest report would come out. MARTIN: But haven't we heard both the FBI and Homeland Security point to the threat from white supremacists as a priority? YOUSEF: Yes. You know, DHS officials have said white supremacist extremists are the most persistent and lethal threat in the U.S. The FBI says most of their caseload when it comes to racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism involves white supremacy. But one of the issues is that the FBI has changed how they categorize the data. During the Trump era, the agency collapsed classifications of political or ideological motivators of domestic terrorism from roughly a dozen down to just five, and one of those is racially or ethnically motivated violence. But, Rachel, that means that you're now rolling together, you know, both white supremacists and violent Black supremacists into a single category. MARTIN: OK. So explain why that matters. YOUSEF: Well, counterterrorism experts like Michael German say that this leaves federal agencies with tremendous discretion over where they direct their resources. He's with the Brennan Center for Justice. And here's some of his congressional testimony from last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL GERMAN: I think Portland, Ore., is a good example, where the federal government charged almost a hundred people during the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd. But groups from outside of Oregon were traveling in far-right militant groups, like the Proud Boys, were coming into Oregon and instigating violence and committing violence on the street with very little law enforcement interference. YOUSEF: And German said that, in turn, allowed the Proud Boys to continue building their network and organization, Rachel, ultimately to lay the groundwork for their involvement in the January 6 attack at the Capitol. And even though violent white supremacists currently present the most lethal and persistent domestic terrorism threat, you know, that threat changes over time. And so having consistent and timely data can allow federal agencies to be more nimble and accountable when it comes to responding to the evolving threat. MARTIN: NPR's Odette Yousef.

It aims to address what top national security officials say is one of the most significant threats to the country. That threat earned renewed focus only a few weeks ago, when a white gunman shot 10 Black people in a racist attack at a Buffalo grocery store. He has now been charged with a federal hate crime. But even with heightened federal attention on the issue, lawmakers and counterterrorism experts say they lack a critical component - data. NPR's Odette Yousef covers domestic extremism and joins us now. Good morning, Odette. ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: All right. So officials are saying they lack data. What exactly is missing? YOUSEF: Well, Rachel, before I can answer that, let me give you some context. Last week, at least two Senate committees held hearings focusing on domestic extremism and what can be done to prevent another tragic attack like what happened in Buffalo. But what emerged was a really deep partisan divide over how law enforcement should identify and go after threats. You know, Republicans were largely pushing back against focusing exclusively on white supremacist violence, suggesting that it's just as bad from actors on the far left. And it seems that this disagreement might be overcome if they could just agree on the numbers, you know, but lawmakers on both sides complained that they haven't been getting the numbers.

YOUSEF: Well, counterterrorism experts like Michael German say that this leaves federal agencies with tremendous discretion over where they direct their resources. He's with the Brennan Center for Justice. And here's some of his congressional testimony from last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL GERMAN: I think Portland, Ore., is a good example, where the federal government charged almost a hundred people during the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd. But groups from outside of Oregon were traveling in far-right militant groups, like the Proud Boys, were coming into Oregon and instigating violence and committing violence on the street with very little law enforcement interference. YOUSEF: And German said that, in turn, allowed the Proud Boys to continue building their network and organization, Rachel, ultimately to lay the groundwork for their involvement in the January 6 attack at the Capitol. And even though violent white supremacists currently present the most lethal and persistent domestic terrorism threat, you know, that threat changes over time. And so having consistent and timely data can allow federal agencies to be more nimble and accountable when it comes to responding to the evolving threat. MARTIN: NPR's Odette Yousef.

      "text": "Free Speech Advocates, Publishers Wrestle With Questions Of Censorship\n\nLynn Neary\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster drew strong criticism after signing conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos - seen here holding a press conference about the Pulse nightclub shootings. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster drew strong criticism after signing conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos - seen here holding a press conference about the Pulse nightclub shootings.\n\nFree speech advocates see President-elect Trumps's testy relationship with the media and his middle-of-the-night tweets reacting to critics as evidence that he is - at best - insensitive to the First Amendment. And they say one recent controversy, the decision by Simon & Schuster to publish a book by social media provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, has grown out of an atmosphere that encourages hate speech.\n\nNow, PEN America - an organization dedicated to defending the right to free speech all over the world - is starting to pay more attention to what's happening on the home front. PEN is co-sponsoring a protest which will bring a host of well-known writers to the steps of the New York Public Library to protest threats to free expression.\n\n\"We need to be, as citizens, ready to come out,\" says PEN America executive director Suzanne Nossel, \"stand together for basic rights that six months ago we might have been able to take for granted, but that we no longer can.\"\n\nNossel sees these threats coming from several directions: The President-elect's attacks on the press and his critics, the proliferation of fake news and the pattern of trolling on social media.\n\n\"People feel more free to speak their mind,\" she says, \"even if it crosses what would have been considered boundaries of hatred or racism or misogyny, and so I think it then becomes incumbent on others to speak more loudly.\"\n\nBut the job of advocating for free speech has become ever more complicated in the age of social media - which Nossel says can be both an incredible tool for free expression and a threat to it.\n\n\"It has a dampening effect on the depth of discourse, it can lead to this online mobbing and trolling where someone who says something controversial is then targeted, ridiculed. So this is not about the government silencing speech, but it's about speech silencing other speech.\"\n\nPerhaps no one has crossed the line on social media more boldly than Milo Yiannopoulos, who was kicked off of Twitter after he spearheaded a nasty campaign against black actress Leslie Jones. Yiannopoulos likes to describe himself as a free speech fundamentalist:\n\nTrying to suppress hateful speech doesn't make it go away.\n\nJoan Bertin\n\n\"What the left wants to do is it wants to enable its extremists on its own side, the sexists and misandrists of feminism, the black supremacists of Black Lives Matter, they want to enable extremists on their own side, and silence the extremists on the other. Well, I don't like the extremists on either side.\"\n\nYiannopoulos, an editor at the ultra-conservative Breitbart News, seems to take delight in infuriating people with remarks that are viewed as racist, misogynistic and anti-immigrant. So it's not surprising that Simon & Schuster's decision to publish his book drew strong criticism and calls for a boycott of the company. Dennis Johnson is the head of Melville House, a small independent publisher\n\n\"Nobody in the protest is saying 'you have no right to be published,'\" he says. \"'You have no right, Simon & Schuster, to publish this guy, and this guy, you have no right to be published' - nobody's saying that. What they're saying is, 'we're shocked and we're outraged that you would stoop so low to make a buck as to publish this purveyor of vile hate speech.'\"\n\nThis is not about censoring right wing voices. This is about combating hate speech and its entry into the mainstream.\n\nDennis Johnson\n\nJohnson is highly critical of a statement issued by the National Coalition Against Censorship on behalf of a number of industry groups representing publishers, authors and booksellers. The NCAC says anyone has a right to call for a boycott of Simon & Schuster - but that such a protest will have a \"chilling effect\" on publishing. Joan Bertin, executive director of the NCAC, says similar protests have already led to censorship: \"We know of instances in which books that contain certain kinds of content have been shelved, deferred, redacted, edited deeply to remove content that people might object to.\"\n\nBoth the NCAC and PEN America say the best response to hate speech is not more censorship.\n\n\"Trying to suppress hateful speech doesn't make it go away,\" says Bertin. \"I mean, I think the whole idea of free speech requires us to be active participants, and when we hear ideas that we think are bad and harmful, it requires us to say 'why,' not just say 'shut up.'\"\n\nBut publisher Dennis Johnson says another equally important right is at stake here: The right to protest.\n\n\"This is not about censoring right wing voices,\" he says. \"This is about combating hate speech and its entry into the mainstream.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "RACES: The Black Supremacists\n\n\"Every white man knows his time is up,\" snapped the frail-looking Negro in the embroidered pillbox to 5,500 Negroes packed into Manhattan's St. Nicholas Arena one hot afternoon last week. \"I am here to teach you how to be free. Yes, free from the white man's yoke. We want unity of all darker peoples on the earth. Then we will be masters of the United States, and we are going to treat the white man the way he should be treated.\" Roared the crowd: \"That's right! More! More!\" For more than two hours, as shouts and applause rose in regular cadences, the scowling, incendiary speaker obliged by pouring out his scorn upon all \"white devils,\" \"satisfied black men,\" the \"poison\" Bible, Christianity's \"slave-master doctrine,\" and America's \"white for white\" justice.\n\nThe purveyor of this cold black hatred is known to some 70,000 Negro followers (he claims 250,000) in 29 U.S. cities as Elijah Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, head of a stern, demanding, disciplined black-supremacist religious sect called \"the Moslems.\"* Calmly feeding the rankling frustration of urban Negroes, the Moslems reach deep among the least-educated, lowest-paid Negroes jammed into big-city slums from Harlem to Los Angeles. Muhammad's virulent anti-Americanism and antiSemitism, plus his elite corps of dark-suited, shaven-polled young \"honor guards,\" has lifted him well beyond the run-of-the-street crackpot Negro nationalist groups. The Moslems are of rising concern to respectable Negro civic leaders, to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to police departments in half a dozen cities, and to the FBI.\n\nMen Named \"X.\" Elijah Muhammad was born Elijah Poole, son of a Baptist minister, in Sandersville, Ga. on Oct. 7, 1897, later moved with his family to Detroit. One momentous day, he tells the faithful, he met one Fard Muhammad, who revealed himself to be \"Allah on earth\"-on earth, that is, just long enough to pick the \"messenger\" for his black-supremacy doctrine. Messenger Elijah dropped his \"slave-master name\" of Poole, took up the spiritual surname Muhammad (lacking religious surnames, his ministers just use \"X\"). He founded Temple No. i in 1931, but soon ran into difficulties.\n\nDetroit police arrested him in April 1934 on charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (six months' probation), and in November some of his would-be followers got disgusted with his teaching, drove him out of town. He set up permanent headquarters in Chicago, preached against the white man's draft registration in World War II. When FBI agents tracked him to his mother's Chicago home in September 1942, they found him rolled up in a carpet under her bed. He was in federal prison at Milan, Mich, for draft dodging until 1946, later made a play for recruits among ex-convicts. His New York leader, Malcolm X, once Malcolm Little, is an ex-convict who has been arrested for larceny in two states.\n\nAn ascetic little man, Elijah sternly demands that his followers give up tobacco, dope and alcohol, bathe often, pray toward Mecca five times a day, even if it means falling upon their knees in the streets. Moslem women should dress modestly, use no lipstick, never allow themselves to be alone in a room with any man except their husbands. Attacking all forms of dependence upon whites, Elijah set up a Moslem restaurant, cleaning business, barbershop, butcher shop, grocery store and department store on Chicago's South Side, a cafe in Harlem, a cafe and a farm near Atlanta, also bought himself a luxurious, 18-room house near the University of Chicago. He founded \"Universities of Islam\" in Chicago and Detroit (the latter accredited by the local school board through the ninth grade) to teach his dogma to children and teenagers. Sample from his official temple creed: \"There is no good in white men. All are the children of the devil.\"\n\nMuhammad also trained muscle. Each congregation has its \"Fruit of Islam\" force of young men, who take judo training in their temples, are commanded by Muhammad's son-in-law, burly \"Supreme Captain\" Raymond Sharrieff. The F.O.I. protects its racist chief as if he were in constant danger of assassination. At each mass meeting, the F.O.I, frisks every male who attends, while \"Sisters\" in flowing white robes and headpieces stand inside a separate entrance (segregation by sexes also) to frisk each woman, put all potential weapons such as nail files in checking bags.\n\n\"Worse Every Day.\" Muhammad's doctrine of total hate found a ready medium in some Negro newspapers, which began to exploit Negro hopes and fears after the Emmett Till case. The Pittsburgh Courier, Negro national weekly, and the Los Angeles Herald-Dispatch, booming West Coast Negro paper, not only gained attention from his personal column, but also found their circulations boosted fast by Moslems who hawked the papers on street corners as a spiritual duty. Such leading Negro Harlem politicos as Congressman Adam Clayton Powell (pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church) and Manhattan Borough President Hulan Jack have curried Moslem favor, even though full-fledged Moslems are enjoined not to vote.*\n\nThus far the Moslems have been strictly law-abiding-a fact that worries some cops more than minor outbreaks of violence. \"It's getting worse every day,\" says a Los Angeles police official, \"and I only wish I knew what it's going to take to light the fuse.\" The Moslems themselves talk of 1970 as their DDay, expansively predict that before that time the big white nations will have eliminated each other with atomic warfare and Black Africa will stand unchallenged. Says Chicago Urban League's Negro Director Edwin C. Berry: \"A guy like this Moslem leader makes a lot more sense than I do to the man in the street who's getting his teeth kicked out. I have a sinking feeling that Elijah Muhammad is very significant.\"\n\n*Which outrages the U.S.'s 100,000 true Moslems, who back their centuries-old stand against racial discrimination with chapter and verse from the Koran. Chapter 49, verse 13: All mankind We created/ You are from a single pair / Of a male and a female/ And made you into/ Nations and Tribes/ Ye may know each other/ (Not that ye may despise/ Each other).\n\n*Among the top-ranking Xegro villains of the Moslems and African Nationalist fringe groups: U.N. Under Secretary Ralph Bunche, who won a Nobel Prize for making peace between Israel and the Arabs, hence is condemned as \"the George Washington of Israel.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

Messenger Elijah dropped his \"slave-master \nname\" of Poole, took up the spiritual surname Muhammad (lacking \nreligious surnames, his ministers just use \"X\"). He founded Temple No. \ni in 1931, but soon ran into difficulties.\n\nDetroit police arrested him in April 1934 on charges of contributing to \nthe delinquency of a minor (six months' probation), and in November \nsome of his would-be followers got disgusted with his teaching, drove \nhim out of town. He set up permanent headquarters in Chicago, preached \nagainst the white man's draft registration in World War II. When FBI \nagents tracked him to his mother's Chicago home in September 1942, they \nfound him rolled up in a carpet under her bed. He was in federal prison \nat Milan, Mich, for draft dodging until 1946, later made a play for \nrecruits among ex-convicts. His New York leader, Malcolm X, once \nMalcolm Little, is an ex-convict who has been arrested for larceny in \ntwo states."

      "text": "The FBI's New U.S. Terrorist Threat: 'Black Identity Extremists'\n\nManage your account\n\nAs white supremacists prepared to descend on Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, the FBI warned about a new movement that was violent, growing, and racially motivated. Only it wasn't white supremacists; it was \"black identity extremists.\"\n\nAmid a rancorous debate over whether the Trump administration has downplayed the threat posed by white supremacist groups, the FBI's counterterrorism division has declared that black identity extremists pose a growing threat of premeditated violence against law enforcement.\n\n\"The FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\" reads the report , marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy .\n\nThe August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for widespread anger and violence, the FBI report says, concluding that continued \"alleged\" police abuses have fueled more violence.\n\n\"The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\" the report states.\n\nSome 748 people have been shot and killed by police so far in 2017, including at least 168 African-Americans.\n\nThe report, dated Aug. 3 - just nine days before the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville turned deadly - appears to be the first known reference to \"black identity extremists\" as a movement. But former government officials and legal experts said no such movement exists, and some expressed concern that the term is part of a politically motivated effort to find an equivalent threat to white supremacists.\n\nA former senior counterterrorism and intelligence official from the Department of Homeland Security who reviewed the document at FP 's request expressed shock at the language.\n\n\"This is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,\" the former official said. \"There are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.\"\n\nThe concept of \"black identity extremists\" appears to be entirely new. FP found only five references to the term in a Google search; all were to law enforcement documents about domestic terrorism from the last two months. One of those online references is to law enforcement training on identifying \"domestic terror groups and criminally subversive subcultures which are encountered by law enforcement professionals on a daily basis.\"\n\nAmong the six acts of premeditated violence linked to black identity extremists - it excludes violence toward police carried out in the normal course of their duties - the reports cites the July 2016 shooting of 11 police officers in Dallas. The shooter, Micah Johnson, was reportedly angry at police violence.\n\n\"Based on Johnson's journal writings and statements to police, he appeared to have been influenced by BIE ideology,\" the FBI report states. The attack took place during a Black Lives Matter protest of police shootings, though the BLM movement is not mentioned by name in the report.\n\nYet those involved in the Black Lives Matter movement have voiced concerns about FBI surveillance.\n\nDeRay McKesson, an activist involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, told FP that the FBI visited his house in the run-up to the Republican National Convention. \"I spoke about the FBI visit to my house and the houses of other activists in our final meeting with [President Barack] Obama,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a long tradition of the FBI targeting black activists and this is not surprising,\" McKesson said.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the report itself and did not respond to specific questions, but in an emailed statement to FP , the bureau defended its tracking of \"black identity extremists,\" saying that \"the FBI cannot initiate an investigation based solely on an individual's race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of First Amendment rights.\"\n\nIn its August report, t he FBI said it expects further attacks by black identity extremists, driven by both the perception and the reality of unfair treatment at the hands of police officers.\n\n\"The FBI further assesses it is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement,\" the report says.\n\nSome experts and former government officials said the FBI seemed to be trying to paint disparate groups and individuals as sharing a radical, defined ideology. And in the phrase \"black identity extremist\" they hear echoes of the FBI's decades-long targeting of black activists as potential radicals, a legacy that only recently began to change.\n\n\"They are grouping together Black Panthers, black nationalists, and Washitaw Nation,\" said the former homeland security official. \"Imagine lumping together white nationals, white supremacists, militias, neo-Nazis, and calling it 'white identity extremists.'\"\n\nThe FBI is linking the people discussed in the report based only on them being black, rather than on any sort of larger ideological connection, the official said. \"The race card is being played here deliberately.\"\n\nMichael German, a former FBI agent and now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice's liberty and national security program, said manufacturing this type of threat was not new. He has criticized earlier FBI reports on \"black separatists,\" arguing that they conflated radical groups operating in the 1970s with attacks in 2010 and later, even though there was no obvious connection.\n\nThe use of terms like \"black identity extremists\" is part of a long-standing FBI attempt to define a movement where none exists. \"Basically, it's black people who scare them,\" German said.\n\nEven former officials who view the government's concerns about black separatists as legitimate balked at the term \"black identity extremist,\" and point out that the threat from individuals or groups who want to establish their own homeland is much less than from the far right.\n\nIn 2009, Daryl Johnson, then a Department of Homeland Security intelligence analyst, warned of the rise of right-wing extremism, setting off a firestorm among congressional critics. Johnson, who left the department in 2010, said he could think of no reason why the FBI would create a new category for so-called black identity extremists. \"I'm at a loss,\" he replied, when asked about the term.\n\n\"I have no idea of why they would come up with a new term.\"\n\nThere have been concerns about rising violence among black separatist groups in recent years, he said, but it does not approach the threat of right-wing extremism. \"When talking about white supremacists versus black supremacists, there are way more white supremacists,\" Johnson said.\n\nFor historians and academics who have looked at the history of FBI surveillance of black Americans, the report also smacks of the sort of blatant racism the bureau has worked hard to leave behind. From the time J. Edgar Hoover took over the anti-radical division in the FBI at the height of the first \"red scare\" in 1919, the bureau began systematically surveilling black activists.\n\nFBI and DHS Assessment Outlined Threat of Lone Offenders Targeting Las Vegas: The U.S. government warned of possible attacks on entertainment venues and mass gatherings.\n\nCalifornia Is Already Preparing for a North Korean Nuclear Attack: Beware of radioactive pets, and don't expect the feds to show up anytime soon.\n\nSenate Probe Gets 'Clearer Picture' of Possible Trump, Russia Collusion: Sen. Richard Burr said his committee's investigation has \"expanded slightly.\"\n\n\"Black protests get conflated for the bureau [with communism], and it begins there,\" said William Maxwell, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who has researched the FBI's monitoring of black writers in the 20 th century.\n\nWhat followed, according to Maxwell, was decades of FBI pursuit of black radicals in the belief, often mistaken, that they were part of a larger subversive movement. \"It's deep in the bureau's DNA,\" he said.\n\nLately, that seemed to be changing. As FBI director, James Comey famously kept a copy of the Martin Luther King Jr. wiretap order on his desk as a reminder of the bureau's past abuses and made new agents learn the history of the FBI's pursuit of the civil rights leader.\n\nThe FBI also appeared to be focusing more attention on the threat of white supremacists. In May, the FBI warned that white supremacist violence was growing, according to a report obtained and published by FP . That same report noted that white supremacists were responsible for more attacks in the United States than any other extremist group, including Islamic extremists.\n\nCritics, however, accuse President Donald Trump of shifting attention away from right-wing violence. This year, the Trump administration decided to focus the Department of Homeland Security's \"countering violent extremism\" program on Islamic terrorism and deprioritized funding to counter white supremacist groups .\n\n\"To hear there is a new initiative targeting black identity extremists is surprising given that shift,\" said Alvaro Bedoya, the executive director of the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law.\n\nMaxwell, the Washington University professor, had an even darker view. \"It's classic Hoover-style labeling with little bit of maliciousness and euphemism wrapped up together,\" he said. \"The language - black identity extremist - strikes me as weird and really a continuation of the worst of Hoover's past.\"\n\nIn a sense, the FBI's desire to identify a unifying ideological underpinning to what are often individual violent acts is not surprising, said David Garrow, a historian who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of MLK. \"Security agencies want to perceive a threat that is political, a threat that ideological,\" Garrow said, \"but what we're actually witnessing is men, almost entirely men, acting out in violent criminal ways and grasping at some chimera of political justification.\"\n\nBut the document itself smacks of incompetence more than conspiracy, according to Garrow, who reviewed a copy of the report provided by FP . \"The immediate instinct is to think [the FBI] are a threat,\" he said. \"My immediate instinct is to wonder whether they are minimally competent.\"\n\nGarrow, who has reviewed decades' worth of FBI documents for his work, warned against seeing this report as proof that the FBI is illegally targeting black Americans.\n\n\"They are often so clueless,\" he said of the FBI. \"I don't find them a threat.\"\n\nBut the former homeland security official said the report's tendency to lump together different groups that have no obvious connection will make it harder for law enforcement to identify real threats. \"It's so convoluted - it's compromising officer safety,\" the former official said.\n\nAnd even though the report mentions in a footnote that \"political activism\" and \"strong rhetoric\" by themselves don't amount to extremism and \"may be constitutionally protected,\" it identifies anger with police or \"anti-white rhetoric\" as indicators of a potential \"violent threat.\"\n\n\"Just the term 'black identity extremist' is protected,\" the former official said. \"You can identify all you want.\"\n\nThe FBI, however, defended the classification in its statement to FP .\n\n\"Domestic terrorism groups differ from traditional criminal groups in that they take action for a different purpose, to bring attention to a social or political cause,\" the FBI wrote. \"Therefore, their existence as a group has a legitimate purpose, at least in part. Their legitimate activity may include acts of protest, advocacy, and civil disobedience.\"\n\nThe FBI says there are \"nine persistent extremist movements\" in the United States at present. Those include \"white supremacy, black identities, militia, sovereign citizens, anarchists, abortion, animal rights, environmental rights, and Puerto Rican Nationalism.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images"

      "text": "What Ken Burns' Muhammad Ali Doc Misses About the Nation of Islam\n\nManage your account\n\nWatching Ken Burns' new four-part Muhammad Ali documentary stirred my recollections on what the three-time heavyweight champion and the Nation of Islam meant to youths growing up in East Elmhurst, a residential enclave for \"Black Muslims\" in Queens.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, East Elmhurst was home to an assortment of community leaders grappling with the dilemma of racial injustice. Among these were civil rights proponents like Bill Booth, a former judge and chairman of the New York City Human Rights Commission, and NOI figures like Malcolm X , Betty Shabazz and Louis Farrakhan .\n\nThe Burns film, Muhammad Ali , did a good job of chronicling the usual markers of Ali's life story but fell short in depicting why the NOI would appeal to ordinary Black youths at the time; instead, it spotlighted the group's \"separatist\" identity, the \"exotic\" faith and uniforms, the internal rivalries, and the intemperate statements of organization speakers.\n\nI imagine this is to be expected for a mainstream cultural creation that relies on footage from the national press. It's an approach that is prone to recycle old vantage points like the 1959 CBS documentary on Malcolm X and other \"Black supremacists,\" The Hate That Hate Produced . To us, though, the Muslims were little more than disaffected Baptists seeking alternative outlets.\n\nThe NOI was founded in Detroit in 1930 on the principles of freedom, justice, and equality for people of African descent. By the 1960s, when I became aware of the organization, it had grown to an estimated 70,000 members in the major cities thanks in part to the appeal of charismatic figures like Malcolm X, the national spokesman, and Muhammad Ali.\n\nWhat the documentary glosses over are the symbols of cultural pride and cooperative ventures that I recall as noteworthy to my peers. For example, the NOI members took steps to let us know that our lives mattered without the slogans and protest marches. It was common to see older men reach out to boys in the parks and on front steps to discuss history, current affairs, and personal goals. What did we want out of life? How do we conduct ourselves as young men? How will we contribute to the community and so forth?\n\nMike Tyson: Why I'm a Muslim for Donald Trump\n\nThey discussed respect for women and family and organized street games like sprints and stick ball. They formed neighborhood watch groups-and one time even retrieved a bicycle that had been stolen by a white passerby. Some narrated the lost history of African civilizations like ancient Sumer and Kush and the medieval empires of Ghana and the Moors. These were things we never heard about from teachers in primary school.\n\nMany of the NOI elders were of modest education. They sometimes got facts wrong or inflated historic achievements-but they tried within limitations to instill confidence in the next generation. Some of us made fun of them for wearing bowties, spouting mumbo-jumbo about the origins of white people, or carrying themselves with the strained dignity of men shunted aside by society. Others of us, though, quietly appreciated the attention of ordinary role models with all their flaws.\n\n\"Heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali (R) sits on the podium with Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad while attending the National Meeting of the Black Muslims. Ali drew a standing ovation when he addressed the crowd at the International Amphitheater in Chicago.\"\n\nMostly what they espoused were the teachings of the man born as Elijah Poole, a Georgia sharecropper who was an early member of the NOI and became its leader from the 1930s until his death in 1975. He changed his named to Elijah Muhammad and doled out a version of \"mother wit\" in \"Message to the Blackman in America.\" The Burns film showed Ali holding a copy of the 1973 work but neglected to explain either the message or its appeal to the ordinary person.\n\nWhat attracted us was not the message of Islam as much as the message of Black pride, self-improvement, and group cooperation. The NOI promoted survival strategies for marginal populations in the urban centers. It advocated common sense practices like living within your means, saving as much as possible, nurturing a supportive family life, spending your money among yourselves, supporting Black-owned businesses or businesses that hire your people, and seeking to improve health, education and community.\n\nSuch teachings gave us a blueprint to improve our chances in life. By contrast, the way of the civil rights programs required an over-reliance on factors outside of our control: protest marches, political coalitions, passage of laws, or begging white people to pay attention to our needs. While some of these things were necessary remedies, they relied so much on the positive responses of white institutions that it could foster a sense of dependency.\n\nThe NOI encouraged us to forge alliances across the sizable Black communities in the urban centers and across the Pan-African world. It was a model of communalism that offered a more affirming foundation than the strategy of unceasing rallies and marches-and the NOI practiced what it preached. In the 1960s, the organization instituted an economic program of cooperative development that included the purchase of farms, timberland, home construction, delivery trucks, and businesses owned by individual members and the organization.\n\nIn Chicago, for example, it opened 15 different businesses including a clothing factory, supermarket, meat packing company, bakery, restaurant, and barbershop. Across the country, it established grocery stores, dress shops, dry cleaners, bakeries, and restaurants that provided food, cooked meals, and clothing to the Black community at affordable prices. Moreover, it hired and trained people for jobs as managers, clerks, cooks, accountants, carpenters and the like.\n\nBasically, what Elijah Muhammad espoused were adaptations of the economic development program of Booker T. Washington and his National Negro Business League in 1900. Growing up in Georgia, Poole would have observed such initiatives at work in Atlanta and in the business districts of Black communities like Tulsa, Detroit, and Chicago.\n\nThe ideas were taken up in Harlem by the Pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914. Elijah Muhammad adapted the idea of cooperative ventures to the NOI, according to Claude Clegg in his 1997 biography, An Original Man . In addition, he witnessed the function of such programs during the Great Depression and of incarcerated Black men running prison services-if they could do it in the joint, he reasoned, why not in their own communities?\n\n\"Muhammad Ali enjoying a spontaneous encounter with his fans in Detroit, MI. Circa 1977.\"\n\nFinally, the film alluded to Ali being exploited by the NOI to finance mosques and other operations. As youths, we had no knowledge of such things, of course. However, the relationship to us seemed more on par with that of a wealthy benefactor to a favored church.\n\nTo return to 2021, the African American political class continues to grapple with the dire conditions of their people. For the most part, they have exhausted the prospects for meaningful change through protest-and can no longer stake a primary claim to the \"diversity\" jobs and programs in government, corporations, and institutions. For that reason, Black leaders should revisit the NOI strategy for economic development that inspired Muhammad Ali.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Having insulted black Rush Limbaugh fans in the past, Touré said Dr. Carson's \"un-serious\" ideas are tolerated on the right only because he can be held up as a token black friend.\n\nNow, a recent report by the Daily Caller suggests the television host has long seen the world through a racial lens.\n\n\"MSNBC host Touré founded a student newspaper dedicated to black liberation theology while he was a college student attending Emory University from 1989 to 1992,\" The Daily Caller claims. \"Touré's flagship publication, The Fire This Time, lavished praise on famous anti-Semites, black supremacists, and conspiracy theorists whom Touré helped bring to campus. Before he became an intense-but-sardonic TV personality, Touré also decried 'the suffocating white community' and defended a nationally famous fake hate crime.\"\n\nAccording to the 4-page report, Touré helped coordinate speakers his paper described as \"role models from the real world to speak about life.\"\n\nThe guests allegedly included Conrad Muhammad, the heir apparent at the time Louis Farrakhan with the virulently anti-white Nation of Islam (he has since defected), and H. Rap Brown, a.k.a. Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, who was once on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and was quoted as saying \"If America don't come around, we're gonna burn it down.\"\n\nHe now refers to his guests, including Brown, as \"some of the heroes of black nationalism of the 1960s,\" according to the Daily Caller.\n\nTouré also argued as a student that even though black freshman Sabrina Collins faked the racist graffiti on her dorm at Emory University, that was besides the point.\n\nWriting in The Fire This Time after Collins retracted her statement, Touré vented: \"In the aftermath THE POSSIBILITY THAT COLLINS HERSELF PERPETRATED THE CRIME HAS SEEMED TO MINIMIZE THE INCIDENT'S IMPORTANCE. IN ANALYZING THE EVENT'S IMPORTANCE TO EMORY, IT IS NOT AT ALL IMPORTANT IF COLLINS DID IT.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Caller, Touré holds approximately the same view some twenty years later. He told them in an interview: \"Just because this particular incident didn't happen doesn't mean we don't get to talk about racism in Emory or in society. Or that we forget the tragic things that happen to black people. The point there was, she may have done this to herself, but this in no way suggests that racism does not exist.\"\n\nHe also defended his paper as \"an important media voice in the ecology.\"\n\n-\n\nRelated:\n\nMusic Star John Legend Joins MSNBC Host in Mocking Black Rush Limbaugh Fan on Twitter\n\nHannity Panel of Black Conservatives Bashes the Left's Attempt to Have 'Power & Control' Over Them\n\nTwitter Explodes After Black Actress Endorses Romney as the 'Only Choice for Your Future'"

      "text": "Anti-Trumpers Only Embarrass Themselves\n\nManage your account\n\nW hen you are a jackhammer, everything looks like a broken sidewalk. This is why the Trump-hating media are demolishing themselves.\n\nThe Left's journalists and artists are so deeply consumed by vile, vicious, venomous rage towards President Donald J. Trump and his supporters that they have become incapable of clear thought.\n\nJust about daily, they soil themselves and stain beyond recognition the notion of a free press as a bulwark of American liberty. Instead, they humiliate themselves while aiming to \"get Trump\" and reverse the results of the 2016 election, which they remain too juvenile to accept, even halfway through Trump's first term.\n\nConsider these recent national embarrassments.\n\n• Leftist journalists and \"entertainers\" perpetrated an appalling rush to misjudgment regarding the MAGA-hat-wearing students from Kentucky's Covington Catholic High School. Responding instantly to an abbreviated video shot in front of the Lincoln Memorial, this media mob immediately bullied these teenage boys as white supremacists who had tormented Nathan Phillips, a Native American Indian activist.\n\n\"Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?\" former CNN host Reza Aslan asked via Twitter about Nick Sandmann, who stood in front of Phillips. \"If you know this little s***,\" musician Wheeler Walker Jr. wrote about Sandmann, \"punch him in the nuts and send me the video of it and I'll send you all my albums on vinyl, autographed.\"\n\n\"Fire on the maga c***s***ers,\" [no apostrophes in the original], insisted gay-baiting Los Angeles DJ Michael Buchanan, AKA Uncle Shoes. \"LOCK THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL AND BURN THAT BITCH TO THE GROUND.\"\n\nJack Morrissey, a co-producer of Walt Disney's 2017 live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast , was beastly indeed via Twitter: \"#MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper.\" CNN alumna and alleged comedian Kathy Griffin, who once proudly posed with a mock-up of President Trump's decapitated head, insisted: \"Name these kids. I want NAMES. Shame them. If you think these f***ers wouldn't dox you in a heartbeat, think again.\" [Again, no apostrophes in the original.]\n\nOnce their doxxed private information went public, these boys and their families began to receive death threats and demands that their parents get fired from their jobs. For safety's sake, Covington shut down this week.\n\nBut additional video told a 180-degree different story. The boys clapped along as Phillips banged his drum in Sandmann's face. The teen smiled silently. \" Go back to Europe where you came from,\" another Native American Indian taunted these children. As it happens, the only racist homophobes on the scene were . . . the Black Hebrew Israelites. These black supremacists called the teens \" crackers \" and \" a bunch of faggots made out of incest.\"\n\nOops.\n\nLast week, BuzzFeed unveiled a \"bombshell\": President Trump ordered his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a proposed Trump Organization real-estate project in Moscow. On January 18, MSNBC invoked impeachment 82 times, while CNN did so 97 times.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller's office then turned BuzzFeed 's \"bombshell\" into a sopping wet firecracker, calling it \"not accurate.\"\n\nDrat!\n\nAmerica's so-called \"Paper of Record\" reported on January 11 that the FBI had probed the president for allegedly advancing Russia's agenda . The left-wing media erupted into a war dance, convinced that Donald J. Trotsky must be a KGB deep-cover asset, perhaps transferred from Leningrad to Queens as a boy, via Soviet submarine.\n\nThe Trump haters skipped right past a detail buried in the story that confirms the pointlessness of the FBI's Trump-despising former leadership: The Bureau found no evidence that Trump works for Vladimir Putin.\n\nD'oh!\n\nThe media also make jackasses of themselves by complaining about small things that proved untrue.\n\n• No, there is no Pentagon restriction against Trump signing MAGA hats for U.S. GIs in Iraq who asked him to do so.\n\n• No, the Clemson athletes who devoured Trump's fast-food feast in the White House didn't hate it. They enjoyed it.\n\n• No, Trump did not evict the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, as Time Magazine's Zeke Miller reported on January 20, 2017, the very first day of Trump's presidency. The bust stayed exactly where it was, although temporarily blocked by a door. Miller apologized, but he should have checked before passing along such incendiary misinformation.\n\nThe leftist media's relentless acid throwing surely has damaged Trump. Imagine how much more popular and successful he would be if his major-network evening news coverage had not been 90 percent negative in 2018, according to the Media Research Center.\n\nBut this caisson of non-explosive \"bombshells\" has run right over the media's feet, turning them to mush.\n\nWhat explains the media's incessant self-mutilation?\n\n\"Because we're desperate to get Trump out of office ,\" said Joy Behar, co-host of ABC's The View . \"I think the press jumps the gun a lot because we just have so much circumstantial evidence against this guy that we are basically hoping Cohen's got the goods and what have you,\" she added. \"It's wishful thinking.\"\n\nObjective journalism is dead. Its replacement? Wall-to-wall, seething hatred of America's commander-in-chief and countless examples of assassination chic , left-wing celebrities who publicly fantasize about murdering the president of the United States. This likely has empowered Antifa and other far-leftists to beat Trump supporters in the streets until they bleed - even while calling their victims violent.\n\nThese epic fails should chasten media people, so they might calm down, rejuvenate objectivity, and check flimsy stories at least briefly before cartwheeling like circus clowns about the latest \"evidence\" of wrongdoing by Trump and his followers.\n\nMore likely, though, the Trump haters have learned nothing from all of this. As they labor to destroy the president, these ink-stained suicide bombers are destroying themselves.\n\nTrump Should Keep Calm and Sic His Surrogates on Comey\n\nA Twitter Fail Reveals That Media Narratives about Obama Still Trump the Truth\n\nTrump-Russia Conspiracy Theories Are Unlikely to Pan Out"

Who are the best targets? Off duty police, off duty soldiers, gang member, family members of soldiers, government agents, workers at ammunition factory, white supremacists or black supremacists.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is best if targeting soldiers or police that they are off duty and out of uniform simply because [their] investigations will look usually for 'robbery gone wrong' or 'revenge' [rather than] as act of terrorism [or] revolt.\"\n\nMr. Begolly was an active moderator on the English-language version of the militant Islamic web discussion forum, Ansar al-Mujahideen Forum.\n\nHe allegedly posted items on the forum under the names \"Asadullah al-Shishani,\" \"Abu Nancy,\" and \"Goatly.\"\n\nThe second count of Begolly's indictment charges that he posted and distributed on the Internet a 101-page explosives course written by a professor who was once Al-Qaeda's top chemical and biological weapons expert.\n\nBegolly warned anyone downloading the document to use \"anonymizing software.\" He also advised downloading it to a flash drive rather than an individual's computer hard drive.\n\n\"Begolly placed a number of postings ... encouraging attacks within the United States,\" the indictment says. \"He suggested the use of firearms, explosives, and propane tanks against targets such as police stations, post offices, synagogues, military facilities, train lines, bridges, cell phone towers, and water plants.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, he used the forum to express his approval of the 9/11 attacks, the 2004 killing of 334 hostages - including 186 children - in Beslan, Russia by Chechen fighters, the kidnapping and beheading of American businessman Nick Berg in Iraq in 2004, and the kidnapping and beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002.\n\nBegolly suggested militant Muslims in the US should attack civilian aircraft, banks, military installations, Jewish schools, and Jewish and daycare centers, according to the indictment.\n\n\"Peaceful protests do not work,\" he posted in July 2010. \"The [non-Muslim unbelievers] see war as [the] solution to their problems, so we must see war as the solution to our[s]. No peace. But bullets, bombs, and martyrdom operations.\"\n\nAfter posting the \"Explosives Course\" online in late December 2010, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation sought to question him. When two agents approached Begolly on Jan. 4, the encounter turned into a physical struggle.\n\nDuring a scuffle, Begolly allegedly bit both agents, drawing blood, as he attempted to retrieve a loaded 9 mm handgun from his jacket pocket.\n\nOfficials said his reaction to the agents was consistent with his advice to other Muslim militants on the forum. They said he had urged his readers to always carry a loaded firearm, to resist any law enforcement encounter - by biting if necessary, and to never be taken alive.\n\n\"Today's guilty plea underscores the need for continued vigilance against homegrown extremism and use of the Internet to incite violence,\" said Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco in a statement.\n\n\"Too often, prosecutions arise only after a perpetrator commits actions ending in tragedy,\" said David Hickton, US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \"On this occasion, I commend the FBI for taking proactive steps to protect the people of the United States before any such tragedy could occur.\"\n\nSenior US District Judge Maurice Cohill set sentencing for Nov. 29.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, founded in 1913, originally declared , \"The immediate object of the League is to stop, by appeals to reason and conscience, and if necessary, by appeals to law, the defamation of the Jewish people. Its ultimate purpose is to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike, and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens.\"\n\nIt was established, that is, to combat Jew-hatred. If and only if the Jewish community is secure, it would then be appropriate to extend organizational resources to helping others in need. Put another way, a Jewish rights organization, founded by Jews, should rightfully focus on the plight of...Jews.\n\nBut for several decades at least, what is now called the ADL does not prioritize Jews. Its new mission is \"To stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.\" The ADL has elevated efforts to serve what it perceives as marginalized communities to equal or higher priority than the Jewish community, as though it has already eradicated antisemitism.\n\nIt has not. Recent FBI statistics show Jews are subject to more hate crimes per capita than any other group of Americans; twice as likely to be targeted as Black Americans, more than twice as likely as Muslims, and 50% more likely than those who are targeted for their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThere are many organizations devoted to supporting marginalized communities; there is only one, in theory, dedicated to protecting Jews. By expanding its efforts beyond the Jewish community, the ADL dilutes its impact at a time of surging antisemitism.\n\nEven more egregious, some of the groups supported by the ADL are hostile to the Jewish community. In 2020, the ADL signed on to a statement, published in a full-page ad in The New York Times , endorsing the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Of course, Black lives do matter. But leaders of BLM and affiliated groups, under the umbrella of the Movement for Black Lives, have wholeheartedly embraced the antisemitic \"Boycott, Divest, and Sanction\" movement, slandering Israel as \"an apartheid state\" that commits \"genocide.\" Even in defending the ADL's support for this organization, CEO Jonathan Greenblatt admitted that \"some involved in the cause hold hateful ideas\" and have \"engaged in antisemitic rhetoric.\" Somehow, that wasn't a deal-breaker.\n\nLater that year, a BLM rally turned into a riot in an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Los Angeles, where many synagogues were graffitied with obscenities, Jewish businesses were looted and vandalized, and anti-Jewish epithets, including \"F* the Jews,\" were shouted. Yet the ADL downplayed the antisemitic nature of these events, laughably contending, \"There is no indication that Jewish businesses or institutions were broadly targeted for vandalism.\"\n\nIn Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in 1991, Al Sharpton led mobs of Black residents in days of rioting as they looted stores, screeched \"death to the Jews!,\" and attacked their visibly Jewish neighbors-even murdering a yeshiva student, Yankel Rosenbaum, following a car accident where a Hasidic Jew accidentally struck and killed a young Black boy. Sharpton's eulogy at the boy's funeral dripped with antisemitic tropes about Jewish money and power. In the three-plus decades since, Al Sharpton has never apologized for fomenting the infamous Crown Heights pogrom, but that didn't stop Greenblatt from mainstreaming him, appearing on his MSNBC television show multiple times .\n\nThe ADL should not be legitimizing Jew-haters, yet under Greenblatt the organization has created a technology initiative funded with $1.75 million from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's charitable foundation. Omidyar has also financed The Intercept , an Iran-apologist, radical left-wing news outlet that has at times defended Hamas and Hezbollah, antisemites in the British Labour Party, the Jew-hating leaders of the Women's March, and supporters of Louis Farrakhan. The Omidyar Network also funds anti-Israel professors like Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University, who has called American Jews \"diehard Fifth Column Zionists working against the best interests of Americans,\" and has tweeted that Israel is responsible for \"every dirty treacherous ugly and pernicious act happening in the world.\"\n\nExtremist imams in some mosques across the country can be found cursing Jews as \"the most devilish ones on the Earth,\" who \"specialize in the shedding of blood, in crime, and in killing.\" The ADL ignores this and actively works to increase immigration from Muslim-majority countries, which their very own studies show have the world's highest rates of Jew-hatred.\n\nIslamist extremists, Black supremacists, anarchists, and left-wing groups where Jew-hatred is on the rise get scant attention from the ADL, which fixates on traditional right-wing bigots. This isn't surprising, given that Greenblatt is an alumnus of the Clinton and Obama administrations.\n\nADL leaders have hijacked the one-time stalwart Jewish defense organization to serve a progressive ideological agenda. This is a scandal that cannot be ignored-nor should it be tolerated. The ADL must return to its one-time \"immediate object,\" which is to end Jew-hatred.\n\nSadly, other legacy Jewish organizations such the JCPA, as well as many Federations and Jewish Community Relations Councils, and even many of our synagogues, have also been commandeered to benefit the pet political causes of their leaders, rather than the people the institutions were formed to serve. Jewish donors, who anoint our American Jewish leaders, have permitted this \"long march through Jewish institutions.\"\n\nAmerican Jewish elites are betraying the American Jewish community, and must be held accountable for their failures. The rest of us need to insist that the leaders fulfill their responsibility to the Jewish community, and to demand they do their jobs-or find new ones.\n\nCharles Jacobs and Avi Goldwasser are the founders of The Jewish Leadership Project .\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writers' own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNo matter who ultimately wins the presidential election, the Jews in America are the big losers. As Professor Ruth Wisse of Harvard has long explained, Jews are the bellwether for the health of democracies. Hatred of Jews rises in societies whose democratic institutions and values are in crisis. Jew-hatred is generally low in healthy, working democracies.\n\nIf we learned nothing else from the election campaign and its aftermath, we learned American democracy is in crisis.\n\nThe media is the first force responsible for this crisis. For the past four years, all major U.S. television networks and national newspapers have dedicated themselves not to reporting news, but to defining the boundaries of acceptable public discourse. Big Tech firms-Facebook, Google and Twitter, in particular, having amassed powers the KGB could only have dreamed of-serve as the enforcers of those boundaries.\n\nThe goal of all media corporations has been the same: to overturn the results of the 2016 election. To advance this goal, the media have demonized President Donald Trump and his supporters for four straight years. The shared conviction has been that by subjecting the public to continuous indoctrination to hate Trump and his supporters, Trump would disappear from the White House, whether through a prolonged special counsel probe, impeachment or defeat at the polls.\n\nNearly all the stories about Trump and his supporters have been negative for the past four years. Consequently, while most Americans never heard that Trump conceived and implemented an entirely new foreign policy doctrine that has met more success than any adopted since the end of the Cold War, all Americans know that the media expect them to believe Trump is a racist. They know that the media expect right-thinking Americans to hate Trump and his supporters, and admire his opponents, from Nancy Pelosi to Black Lives Matter (BLM).\n\nBig Tech, for its part, has made clear that Trump supporters express their support for the Orange Man at their own risk. They may be subjected to doxxing or ostracism, and they may be de-platformed or even fired if they make their views-which deviate from the acceptable boundaries of public discourse, as dictated by the media-known online.\n\nThis massive multi-year indoctrination and enforcement campaign has had mixed results. On the one hand, the election results demonstrated that the media moguls and the social media bazillionaires have utterly failed to convince the public to hate Trump and his supporters. Trump won more votes last week than he won in 2016. He dramatically expanded his support among Hispanics and blacks.\n\nOn the other hand, the polls show how the media and Big Tech have changed American society. There are probably two reasons that the polls were even further off the mark in 2020 than they were in 2016. First, the pollsters themselves operate inside the media bubble. The likes of Nate Silver know that the likes of Jeff Zucker and Jeff Bezos aren't interested in what the public thinks. They are intent on telling the public what to think. The pollsters' questions and polling samples did just that by predicting the desired results.\n\nSecondly, Trump supporters know that the media not only do not want to know what they think. They will punish Trump supporters if they say what they think. So they lie. What Trafalgar Group President Robert Cahaly describes as the \"Shy Trump Voter Effect\" was clearly expressed in the disparity between the polls and the vote count. Why tell an anonymous person who calls you randomly that you intend to vote for Trump? You don't know who he is or what he will do with the information. So you hang up on him or tell him you're voting for Biden.\n\nSince election day, the situation has only grown worse. The progressive social media mobs are calling for boycotts of law firms that represent Donald Trump in his lawsuits alleging massive vote fraud in battleground states. The hope is that without adequate counsel, Trump will lose his legal fight. Politicians and political operatives, along with CNN's Jake Tapper and MSNBC's Jen Rubin, are openly threatening to destroy the livelihoods of Trump administration employees and of Trump supporters who dispute the media's coronation of Biden. Twitter censorship of Trump and his supporters grows more aggressive every day.\n\nThere is every reason to assume that whether or not Biden is inaugurated as anticipated on January 20, this vindictiveness, hatred and censorship will continue to metastasize in the coming months and years.\n\nThe consequences of this media and Big Tech tyranny are disastrous for the health of American democracy. Americans know they are expected to act like the citizens of the totalitarian regime in the Soviet Union. The media will tell them what they can say, and social media will enforce the media's dictates.\n\nAnd like the denizens of the USSR, Americans haven't stopped thinking as a result of this tyranny. They have just stopped telling people what they think.\n\nAs thinkers, Americans seek out explanations. And since Trump supporters cannot receive explanations in the media for what is becoming of their country, they are naturally drawn to alternative voices. Most of them find the explanations in conservative media outlets. But as the aggressiveness of the media and Big Tech increases, many will be drawn to conspiracy theories. The draw of conspiracy theories is that they claim to explain everything.\n\nThis is a problem for Jews.\n\nAnti-Semitism is the mother of all conspiracy theories. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories change over time, but their attraction has remained constant from the days of Pharaonic Egypt to the present. The Jews are a small, distinct group of people. They are relatively weak and non-aggressive, and have no automatic allies. Anti-Semites can attack them with relative impunity. Most importantly, you can develop an entire intellectual thought loop that explains all-natural and unnatural phenomena by saying the Jews are behind them.\n\nDuring Trump's four years in office, American Jews were subjected to a massacre and an attempted massacre carried out by white supremacists, who were indoctrinated by anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on the Internet. The more Trump voters are pushed out of the discourse and demonized, and the less they trust the news they see on TV and in the newspaper headlines, the more they will turn to conspiracy theorists. And as surely as night follows day, more Americans will become convinced that Jews are responsible for everything that is wrong in America.\n\nThis then brings us to the Biden camp. The Biden campaign announced that on Biden's first day in office, he will cancel Trump's executive order banning \"critical race theory\" (CRT)-based training in the federal government. Perhaps more than any single policy announcement, this should send shivers down the spines of American Jews. In 2019, Jews were subjected to a massacre and an attempted massacre carried out by black supremacists, who were steeped in anti-Semitism borne of critical race theory and like-minded claptrap.\n\nCRT ascribes a basic malevolence and inborn racism to all white people. In CRT training, through various indoctrination seminars and rules, whites are coerced to disavow their \"white privilege\" and thereby make the United States, birthed in the original sin of slavery, less sinful and evil.\n\nProgressives, for whom CRT is an article of faith, view politics as a zero-sum game. And that poses a problem. They know they will not be able to repress all white people. And most progressives are white, anyway. To advance their political goal of reorganizing American society around CRT, progressives need a stand-in for whites. By adopting programs against the avatar, they can advance their larger agenda without being noticed. Just as Obama demonized the \"one percenters\" to advance his socialist economic programs that harmed all wage earners and savers, progressives today need a white form of \"one percenters\" to advance their racial governing programs.\n\nEnter the Jews. Since progressives have already determined that Jews are \"white,\" Jews are the perfect nemesis for progressives. There aren't very many Jews. Jews are too weak in the Democratic Party to make progressives pay for their behavior. Many Jews want to be part of the progressive movement and can be depended on to serve as fig leaves. And Jews are fairly easy to identify and single out.\n\nBLM's singling out and vilification of Israel in its original charter, and BLM rioters' repeated targeting of Jewish businesses and synagogues for looting and vandalization, show precisely where the movement is headed.\n\nCRT dominates the discourse on campuses. And today, from Berkeley to Columbia and everywhere in between, the only acceptable form of discrimination is discrimination against Jewish students who dare to support, or fail to sufficiently condemn, the Jewish state of Israel. This too, shows where the movement is headed.\n\nThe media's abandonment of journalism and their hatred of half of American society, as well as the Democrats' embrace of a totalitarian theory of race and American secular sin as an organizing principle, are unmooring America from its democratic, pluralistic anchors. American society is moving into a post-democratic reality. And if action isn't taken to restore those anchors, American society as a whole will suffer. But American Jews will be the first to suffer.\n\nCaroline B.

      "text": "\"Anti-Semitic Propensities\" by Race, According to the Anti-Defamation League\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nCrime\n\nEugene Volokh | 12.11.2019 1:09 PM\n\nThe news about one of the suspects in the Jersey City shooting at a kosher supermarket apparently having been a \"Black Hebrew Israelite\" who apparently\"wrote anti-Semitic and anti-police posts,\" might surprise some who associate anti-Semitism with white nationalists and with extremist Islam or certain forms of Arab nationalism. But hostility to Jews seem to be materially more common among American blacks and American Hispanics than among American whites. (As one might gather, American Black Hebrew Israelites are blacks but not Hebrews or Israelites, at least under the conventional understandings of those terms; some are black supremacists .)\n\nAccording to an October 2016 Anti-Defamation League survey , \"anti-Semitic views\" among black respondents were materially more common than among whites, with 23% of black respondents scoring high on the ADL's scale, compared to only 10% of whites. The results remain largely the same when aggregating the ADL's 6 surveys from 2007 to 2016; between that and the oversample of blacks and Hispanics among the 1532 respondents in 2016, the comparison seems likely to be pretty reliable.\n\nLikewise, 31% of Hispanic immigrants score high on the ADL's scale, as do 19% of U.S.-born Hispanics, compared to 10% of whites. (\"White\" here presumably means \"non-Hispanic white.\")\n\nNow the ADL's \"anti-Semitic index\" may be faulted in some measure; it is based on how many of the following statements a responded agrees with, with a high score being defined as at least 6 out of 11 ( as the 2013 survey report indicates ):\n\nJews stick together more than other Americans. Jews always like to be at the head of things. Jews are more loyal to Israel than America. Jews have too much power in the U.S. today. Jews have too much control and influence on Wall Street. Jews have too much power in the business world. Jews have a lot of irritating faults. Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want. Jewish business people are so shrewd that others don't have a fair chance at competition. Jews don't care what happens to anyone but their own kind. Jews are (not) just as honest as other business people.\n\nSome of these sentiments might not necessarily reflect hostility to Jews; for instance, Jews may indeed in fact stick together more than other Americans-group solidarity is not uncommon among various ethnic groups and especially religious groups-and different people may view that negatively, positively, or neutrally. Likewise, while it's surely an exaggeration to say that Jews always \"like to be at the head of things,\" it may well be both true and good that Jewish culture promotes more ambition and outspokenness than average. Some of the other sentiments may be hostile to Jews (e.g., \"Jews are more loyal to Israel than America\") but still be legitimate subjects for inquiry: I don't think American Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, or that such loyalty to another nation is an exclusive trait of Jews, but many Jews do feel a strong emotional link to Israel, and one can legitimately argue that this link may sometimes mislead them, even to America's detriment. And don't get Jews started on our having a lot of irritating faults .... But on balance, despite its limitations, this list seems like a reasonable basis for comparing the general tenor of attitudes among American whites, blacks, and Hispanics.\n\nOf course, none of this can be generalized to all or even most blacks and Hispanics, any more than either the views of white anti-Semites can be generalized to all or most whites. For each group, those that the ADL labels as having especially high anti-Semitic propensities are a minority, and indeed (with the exception of among foreign-born Hispanics) a small minority. And of course even those who have anti-Semitic views will overwhelmingly not engage in crime against Jews.\n\nBut I think many people assume, both because of the high historical profile of the Nazis and the KKK, and because of the past images of WASP discrimination against Jews, that anti-Semitism in the U.S. is disproportionately a white phenomenon. Such an assumption, it appears, would be in error.\n\nCredit: My coblogger David Bernstein first alerted me to this, by blogging about an earlier survey on the subject in 2014.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Do We Now Have Social Classes of Hate Killers?\n\nOn Dec. 10, religious fanatics Francine Graham and David Anderson went on a bloody rampage in Jersey City, New Jersey. It began in a cemetery, where they opened fire on Detective Joseph Seals, a father of five who had been investigating the murder of an Uber driver the day before, to which Graham's and Anderson's stolen U-Haul had been linked.\n\nWhen Seals approached them, they shot him dead, then drove to the nearby JC Kosher Supermarket. There they began shooting with long assault rifles, with surveillance footage indicating a small yeshiva next door with about 50 children inside as the first target. The racket attracted two police officers in the neighborhood to the scene, and Graham and Anderson barricaded themselves in the store. A two-hour gun battle with police and SWAT teams ensued. Breaching the door with an armored car, the police found the killers dead along with three of their innocent victims.\n\nInside the U-Haul, police found a pipe bomb and a short, rambling manifesto. Both killers identified as members of the Black Hebrew Israelites, a 100-year-old movement the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated as hateful.\n\nBlack Hebrew Israelites believe they are the descendants of the biblical Hebrews. They see the Africans enslaved in the Americas as Israelites severed from their heritage. In their eyes, Jews are imposters, so their hatred for Jews is justified. Anderson kept a YouTube playlist of anti-Semitic material. In one video, a Black Hebrew Israelite preacher shouts \"Satan is in you\" at a Jewish man. \"You stole our history. You are pretending to be us. The messiah, who is a black man, is going to kill you.\"\n\nYet strangely, reaction to the crime from politicians and celebrities on the left ignored this elephant in the room. Indeed, \"ignored\" is a euphemism for the response of Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who wrote on Twitter, \"White Supremacy kills!\" (deleted after well-deserved mockery erupted). ABC talk show host Joy Behar blamed \"white nationalists\" and President Donald Trump, America's \"liar-in-chief,\" for the massacre without bothering to wait for confirmation of the killers' identities. She, too, was subjected to derisory scolding.\n\nIt is instructive, although deeply troubling, that these two highly public figures were so robotically inclined to blame a hate crime on whites that they didn't even wait to learn the facts before bruiting an allegation that might-and did-turn out to be false.\n\nBut most startlingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) issued a statement to his constituents about the massacre, without a word about the victims being targeted as Jews, or anti-Semitism as the motive. Was it because the perpetrators were black that Booker referred to the victims only as neighborhood \"residents\" and their deaths as \"tragedies\"? It is certainly fair to ask, because if the perpetrators had been neo-Nazis and the victims black, Booker would have been keen to tell it like it was: a hate crime-even an act of terrorism-by vicious white supremacist racists, and moreover proof that racism continues to run rampant in the United States.\n\nSome commentators were quick to see a parallel between this glaring omission and then-President Barack Obama's remarks following the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo journalists' massacre in Paris, referring to the jihadi terrorists who went on to murder Jews in a kosher supermarket as \"zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.\" \"Zealots,\" not Islamists? \"Randomly\" in a kosher supermarket? \"Folks,\" not Jews? His words demonstrated an instinct for deference to Muslims at the expense of truth about a recognizable hate pattern.\n\nThese reflexive impulses in the corridors of power to \"disappear\" black and Islamist Judeophobia are an insult to the intelligence of ordinary citizens, but a balm to the progressive mindset, which cannot comfortably process news of victimizing behavior in designated victim groups.\n\nThe left's collusion in the pretense that ethnic identity is a sidebar when hate crimes are committed by blacks cannot be indefinitely sustained. The Jersey City incident isn't an anomaly, but part of a disturbing trend. In a July article in Tablet Magazine titled \"Everybody Knows,\" Armin Rosen chronicles a \"typhoon of violence\" against religious Jews in New York boroughs by blacks and Hispanics.\n\nSo, much as progressives might wish it to be so, white nationalism is not the story here. Yet, rather than face the music, Tlaib, Behar, Booker, and others on the left have on one occasion or another effectively chosen to provide cover for black anti-Semitism, something nobody on the right of the political spectrum would ever dream of doing for actual white supremacists.\n\nFor example, when a white anti-Semite, Robert Gregory Bowers, massacred 11 members of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue in October 2018 and injured four police officers, the progressive media eagerly covered the incident, \"likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,\" in lavish detail, dwelling on Bowers's hatred of Jews. But so did the right-wing Fox News.\n\nOn the other hand, consider the brouhaha over January's \"Covington\" affair. In an out-of-context video clip, a student from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, who was visiting Washington with his peers for its annual March for Life, seemed to be baiting a chanting, drum-beating Native American protester. The entire left-wing mainstream media, meaning virtually all media apart from a handful of exceptions like The Epoch Times and Fox News-which waited until the facts were in-immediately came after the student for his presumed racism with the fervor of a torches-and-pitchforks medieval mob.\n\nOnly later, when the full video was released, was it made clear that the native activist was the aggressor. It also showed that the real bigots at the scene were Black Hebrew Israelites. They were captured on the full video insulting Native Americans as \"savages\" and hurling disgusting anti-Catholic, homophobic insults at the Covington boys such as \"faggots,\" \"crackers,\" and \"pedophiles\"-vile bait the boys maturely refused to take.\n\nYet even after the contextualized material vindicated the boys, many of their most virulent media accusers refused to apologize. Don Lemon of CNN even argued that the MAGA hats the boys were wearing carries a connotation that can provoke a \"conditioned reaction,\" especially from \"marginalized people.\"\n\nTodd Byrd, who teaches race and culture at UCLA, says many black people consider the Black Hebrew Israelites \"a harmless part of their communities.\" Tom Metzger, founder of the neo-Nazi organization White Aryan Resistance, calls them \"the black counterparts of us.\" Between them, which one is infantilizing black supremacists, and which is granting them moral agency?"

      "text": "Homeland Security Portrays White Conservatives as Radical Threats in Training Documents\n\nAmerica First Legal (AFL) has released documents obtained from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) showing that the agency has conducted programs that characterize white people and conservative values as tilting towards radicalism.\n\nThe main characters of four story branches are visually portrayed as white individuals who are presented as slowly slipping into violent radicalism on issues like abortion and government control, among others.\n\nThe exercise participants put themselves as a third party in these storylines to make decisions about how they will deal with the radicalization.\n\nStory Branch 1 is about a white high school student named Jamie who has a couple of conflicts with Asif, who is from an ethnic minority. In one incident, Jamie shoves Asif into a locker. In another incident, Jamie hurls racial epithets against Asif. In a third incident, Jamie is characterized as yelling at his girlfriend and flashing a gun.\n\nStory Branch 2 is about a white man in his late 30s who makes posts on \"radical sites with violent tendencies,\" yells at his wife, and then talks about heading to a political rally to mess with counter protesters.\n\nStory Branch 4 is about a white woman in her mid-40s who is a pro-life advocate. She becomes \"increasingly devout\" after the death of her mother. The woman also gets increasingly fervent about her pro-life stance to the extent that she asks a preacher whether the Bible justifies violence in defense of life. She then shares videos of violent protests with her hairdresser who notices the \"more militant language.\"\n\nStory Branch 5 is about a divorced white woman in her mid-30s who becomes \"fixated on conspiracy theories regarding government connections to child abuse and trafficking.\" In one instance, her boyfriend notices that she was searching through \"more bizarre and frightening conspiracies involving political figures.\"\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, WSEs were responsible for eight of the 16 lethal DVE attacks and caused 81 percent of the deaths from such attacks, the memo states.\n\n\"The most lethal of those attacks involved active shooter incidents in public locations or houses of worship using semiautomatic weapons,\" according to the memo.\n\n\"We expect WSEs to continue to target racial and religious minorities as well as other vulnerable communities.\"\n\nThe remaining half of the lethal attacks in 2018-2019 were attributed to black supremacists, anarchists, sovereign citizens, anti-government violent extremists, and other violent offenders who had multiple or unknown motives.\n\nThe documents reveal that the government is using taxpayer dollars to \"expand its capabilities to deem innocent people as 'extremists' or 'domestic terrorists,'\" according to a May 8 post by AFL.\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security's transformation into a domestic intelligence organization and a Stasi-like Deep State internal security apparatus is alarming,\" Reed Rubinstein, senior counselor for AFL, said in a statement.\n\nIn February 2022, the department received backlash for its decision to link domestic terrorism to misinformation.\n\nIn a Feb. 7 bulletin, the DHS warned that \"the United States remains in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, and other forms of mis- dis- and mal-information introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors.\"\n\nSome expressed concern that the effort to link alleged misinformation with terrorism was an attempt at censorship, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) accused the DHS of \"policing\" speech.\n\nIn July 2022, attorneys from The Heritage Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit against DHS, seeking to secure documents about the government's use of Babel X software to track the social media posts of millions of American citizens.\n\nAccording to the FOIA lawsuit, \"DHS has purchased and continues to purchase a large number of Babel X products.\"\n\nIn one of the documents, the DHS Office for Terrorism and Targeted Violence Prevention said that it \"works to prevent acts of targeted violence and terrorism before they occur by working with local stakeholders to establish local prevention frameworks.\"\n\n\"Over the past several years, the United States has experienced an increasing number of targeted attacks by angry and disaffected individuals motivated by a combination of extremist ideologies and personal grievances,\" the document says. \"This includes individuals motivated by racial or ethnic tensions, as well as those motivated by gender biases. DHS analysis indicates that targeted attacks are often inspired by extreme rhetoric, racist views, conspiracy theories, and other disinformation.\"\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out to the agency for comment.\n\nThe DHS Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships manages the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Grant Program, which purports to prevent extremist attacks from domestic radicals and funds left-leaning nonprofits using podcasts, video games, and drama programs for children.\n\n\"Lone offenders and small cells of individuals motivated by a range of violent extremist ideologies, of both domestic and foreign origin, represent the most persistent terrorism-related threat facing the United States,\" a DHS grant application invitation says. \"Amongst Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs), racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, including white supremacists, likely will remain the most lethal DVE threats.\"\n\nIn 2023, homeland security allocated $20 million of taxpayer money towards TVTP grant programs. Last year, it was $11 million for initiatives currently rolling out now in communities across the country."
