(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nAs it has with other government agencies, the Trump administration is moving swiftly to assert its vision at the Voice of America. As it does so, a question hangs in the air: Is the news organization's journalistic mission, which dates to World War II , in for some fundamental changes?\n\nWithin the past week, VOA placed veteran U.S.-based journalist Steve Herman on an extended absence to investigate his social media activities, and moved to reassign White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara, who had been disciplined during the first Trump administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's choice to lead VOA, unsuccessful Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, joined the organization as a special adviser while awaiting the approval necessary to take over.\n\nVoice of America beams audio and online news reports about the United States throughout the world, typically in the native languages of countries where it operates. At birth, Voice of America told stories about democracy to people in Nazi Germany.\n\nThe agency's charter requires that its journalists deliver independent news and information, and not be a government mouthpiece. Conservatives have often chafed at that; outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the agency employees in 2021 that they often sounded like \"Vice of America\" and shouldn't be afraid to extol the country's greatness.\n\nTrump has also been critical. He said on social media that Lake's appointment will help \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the world FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\"\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, leading Trump's government efficiency efforts, has no use for the organization. He posted on X on Feb. 9 to \"shut them down.\" Musk wrote that \"nobody listens to them anymore\" and that it's \"just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching\" taxpayer money.\n\nIn January, the president appointed L. Brent Bozell, founder of the conservative watchdog Media Research Center, to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and sister outlets like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. The appointment requires Senate approval.\n\nHerman ran afoul of VOA leadership in early February for what could be considered a typical journalist's act: tweeting a link to comments by an activist critical of the administration's efforts to dismantle USAID. A Trump administration official, Richard Grenell, labeled that \"treasonous\" and said Herman should be fired.\n\nLast Friday, Herman received a letter effectively suspending him with pay. The action is pending an investigation \"regarding whether your social media activity has undermined VOA's audiences' perception of the objectivity and/or credibility of VOA and its news operation,\" according to the letter, obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nVOA \"believes that your continued presence in the workplace may otherwise jeopardize legitimate U.S. government interests,\" said the letter, signed by John Featherly, acting deputy director, programming directorate.\n\nA representative for the U.S. Agency for Global Media said Tuesday that it does not discuss personnel matters.\n\nVOA managers told journalists there on Monday about Widakuswara's assignment, without making clear why it was being done or what she would be doing in the future. As a White House reporter in 2021, she was demoted for shouting questions at Pompeo following his appearance at the agency, including one referencing the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. That proved to be short-lived, however, as former President Joe Biden removed agency leadership the day after he was inaugurated.\n\nYet in the wake of her demotion four years ago, dozens of Widakuswara's colleagues signed a letter protesting her treatment, and there's some concern that the action could make them targets with Trump loyalists returning, according to an employee who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\nThere have also been instances of VOA stories being edited or watered down to minimize criticism of Trump, according to some journalists there who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSome holdovers at VOA appear to be trying to appease future leaders from the Trump team, said a former manager there who has heard of similar instances and spoke under condition of anonymity in fear that some people he still knows there could be punished.\n\nA story on VOA's website on Tuesday about the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs played it straight, with contributions from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters. But it included criticism of Trump's plan by leaders in Canada, Mexico and China.\n\nThe quick moves by the Trump administration to assert itself at VOA stands in contrast to the president's first term, where his choice to lead the agency, Michael Pack, didn't take office until three years into the presidency. Trump supporters have also taken a close look at news organizations that are supported in part by government funding, like PBS and NPR, and at government payments for news subscriptions.\n\nIn a memo announcing Lake's appointment as an adviser last week, VOA's chief financial officer Roman Napoli, said the former television anchor's experience in journalism and broadcasting \"will be invaluable as we continue our mission to clearly and effectively present the policies of the Trump administration around the world.\"\n\nThat caused some internal concern. \"If what they're going to create is an all-Trump, all the time outlet, we're going to lose our credibility and our resources,\" said the former manager at VOA.\n\nIn her own memo to staff later in the week, Lake cited comments made by former President John F. Kennedy upon the 20th anniversary of Voice of America that the task is to tell America's story around the world and do it in a way that is truthful. \"That remains our job today,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I am committed to quickly reforming and modernizing the agency into something the American people are willing to support,\" she wrote. \"I look forward to working with you.\"\n\nLake's appointment as leader of VOA is pending approval of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board, which works with the head of the agency that Bozell was chosen to lead. However, that board's membership was recently disbanded by Trump.\n\nJeffrey Trimble, a former deputy director of that advisory board's predecessor, said the new administration had every right to seek congressional approval to change Voice of America's mission. But he thought that would be unwise, since the message VOA sends to other countries about the free flow of ideas in a democracy has a power in its own.\n\n\"It represents a core value of our democracy, which is robust debate about the issues,\" Trimble said. \"They can change that if they want to. But at the moment, they are governed by law.\"\n\n___\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for the AP.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Kari Lake asked for a show of hands.\n\nWho's been canceled? Who's lost friends? Has strained relations with family? Been indicted? Sued for defamation?\n\n\"If your hand did not go up in any of that, then I do think you need to work a little harder. I really do,\" Lake told an adoring crowd of Michigan Republicans gathering last month on Mackinac Island.\n\nLake launched a U.S. Senate campaign for an Arizona seat in a splashy Scottsdale rally on Tuesday, having never conceded that she lost last year's race for Arizona governor. She is trying out new messages and courting the support of national Republicans she's insulted in the past. But the former television news host isn't backing down on the things that made her a star on the far right - her combativeness with perceived enemies, her fealty to Donald Trump and her willingness to defend his election lies.\n\nThat worries some Republicans who fear she will cost them a race that could decide control of the Senate .\n\n\"Kari Lake can win, but she's going to have to run a different campaign than she ran two years ago, and she's going to have to become a serious candidate who talks about serious issues that everyday Republican and independent voters care about,\" said Chris Baker, an Arizona-based Republican political consultant. \"And she hasn't done a lot of that this year.\"\n\nAt her rally Tuesday, Lake didn't concede she lost the last election, but didn't say it was stolen and made only a brief mention of it during a nearly 50-minute-long speech. She said she's \"never going to walk away from the fight to restore honest elections.\"\n\n\"We did everything right, and we saw the disaster of election day in Arizona,\" Lake said. \"Sometimes when things don't go the way we expect, we find ourselves questioning and asking why ... I think God has bigger plans for us.\"\n\nShe heaped praise on Trump, who recorded a video endorsement that was played at the rally, and repeatedly attacked the media, calling journalists covering her event \"fake news fools.\"\n\n\"When I'm back in the White House, I need strong fighters like Kari in the Senate,\" Trump said.\n\nLake also offered conciliatory words for voters who disagree with her, a sharp contrast with her last campaign, when she didn't want support from establishment Republicans, even after she defeated them in the GOP primary.\n\n\"I may disagree with Arizonans who voted for Joe Biden,\" Lake said. \"But I don't think you're a threat to democracy. You are a citizen just like me.\"\n\nAfter once calling Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell an \"old bat\" and saying he needed to be replaced as Republican leader, Lake now says she would support him if she's elected. Last year, she called abortion \"the ultimate sin\" and supported a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona. Now, she says she wouldn't endorse a federal abortion ban.\n\nNational Republican leaders think a GOP candidate could take advantage of what could be a three-way race if Sen. Kyrsten Sinema seeks reelection. Sinema, a former Democrat who became an independent last year, is preparing for a campaign but has not said whether she will seek a second term. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego is likely to have the Democratic nomination locked up.\n\nLake met recently with Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who leads the GOP's Senate campaign work as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and saw several other GOP senators during a trip to Washington. Daines has publicly urged Lake to focus on the future instead of relitigating past elections.\n\nA former television news anchor for nearly three decades in the Phoenix market, Lake was already known locally but had no national profile when she walked away from her career in 2021, declared \"journalism is dead,\" and took a sledgehammer to televisions showing cable newscasts.\n\nRight up to Election Day, she embraced Trump, appeared with right-wing figures like Steve Bannon and blasted establishment Republicans, including the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nShe lost the governor's race by less than 1 point. About four in 10 Arizona voters in the 2022 election said they were \"very concerned\" that Lake's views were too extreme, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of U.S. voters. She lost 11% of Republicans. About 63% of independents and 96% of Democrats backed the winner, Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nBut Lake became a national figure on the far right with her television appearances and her defense of Trump's election falsehoods.\n\nIn the months since, Lake has traveled extensively to speak to Republican groups around the country, her remarks focused largely on her fraudulent election claims. Her frequent trips to Iowa, the state where she was born but also the host of the leadoff presidential caucuses, have raised eyebrows in political circles. Some have floated her as a running mate for Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nShe sued Maricopa County, claiming election officials deliberately created printer malfunctions to cause her to lose. She lost, and her unsuccessful appeals have bounced through the court system , all the way up to the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nShe also was sued for defamation by Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican official who says he has faced death threats because she lied about how he conducted the election.\n\nLast month she was back in court for her third election-related case, where she watched as her lawyer argued that Arizona's public records law entitles her to see copies of signed vote-by-mail envelopes. She claims reviewing the signatures would allow her to prove that ballots were counted that should not have been, drawing parallels to an unprecedented partisan recount of ballots conducted by Trump supporters on behalf of state Senate Republicans following the 2020 election.\n\nHer fights over the 2020 and 2022 elections have only further endeared her to Arizona Republicans, who nominated a slate of Trump-backed candidates who spread election lies and went on to lose in the midterms. She enters the Senate race as an immediate front-runner in the GOP primary, where she'll face Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb .\n\nStung by unexpected Senate losses last year, Republicans in Washington have vowed to take an active role in primaries to help more electable candidates earn the GOP nomination. Lake so far has received a warm, if tentative, reception in the nation's capital, where influential officials who control the party's money and priorities are signaling that they're open to embracing her if she's willing to broaden her base of support.\n\n\"We have had productive conversations with Kari Lake and her team,\" Daines said in a statement. \"She is a talented campaigner with an impressive ability to fire up the grassroots. We have a clear path to victory with two Democrats on the ballot in Arizona.\"\n\nThe NRSC has not ruled out endorsing Lake in the primary, according to a person familiar with the organization's strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Support from the NRSC would potentially open up a lucrative funding stream and signal to donors that Lake has the support of key GOP senators.\n\nAfter harshly criticizing McConnell during her gubernatorial campaign, she now says she would support the Republican leader in Congress because he would be preferable to Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"If the choice is between McConnell and Schumer, who are you going to vote for? It's not going to be Schumer,\" Lake told the AP.\n\nThat's a change of tone from a year ago, when she called McConnell an \"old bat\" at a campaign rally and said it was time to replace him as the GOP leader with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Even as recently as August, she appeared to poke fun at McConnell freezing up during a press conference.\n\n\"I don't even think he can control what comes out of his mouth anymore,\" Lake said on Bannon's podcast. \"I mean there's something going on right now with him.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Kari Lake asked for a show of hands.\n\nWho's been canceled? Who's lost friends? Has strained relations with family? Been indicted? Sued for defamation?\n\n\"If your hand did not go up in any of that, then I do think you need to work a little harder. I really do,\" Lake told an adoring crowd of Michigan Republicans gathering last month on Mackinac Island.\n\nLake launched a U.S. Senate campaign for an Arizona seat in a splashy Scottsdale rally on Tuesday, having never conceded that she lost last year's race for Arizona governor. She is trying out new messages and courting the support of national Republicans she's insulted in the past. But the former television news host isn't backing down on the things that made her a star on the far right - her combativeness with perceived enemies, her fealty to Donald Trump and her willingness to defend his election lies.\n\nThat worries some Republicans who fear she will cost them a race that could decide control of the Senate .\n\n\"Kari Lake can win, but she's going to have to run a different campaign than she ran two years ago, and she's going to have to become a serious candidate who talks about serious issues that everyday Republican and independent voters care about,\" said Chris Baker, an Arizona-based Republican political consultant. \"And she hasn't done a lot of that this year.\"\n\nAt her rally Tuesday, Lake didn't concede she lost the last election, but didn't say it was stolen and made only a brief mention of it during a nearly 50-minute-long speech. She said she's \"never going to walk away from the fight to restore honest elections.\"\n\n\"We did everything right, and we saw the disaster of election day in Arizona,\" Lake said. \"Sometimes when things don't go the way we expect, we find ourselves questioning and asking why ... I think God has bigger plans for us.\"\n\nShe heaped praise on Trump, who recorded a video endorsement that was played at the rally, and repeatedly attacked the media, calling journalists covering her event \"fake news fools.\"\n\n\"When I'm back in the White House, I need strong fighters like Kari in the Senate,\" Trump said.\n\nLake also offered conciliatory words for voters who disagree with her, a sharp contrast with her last campaign, when she didn't want support from establishment Republicans, even after she defeated them in the GOP primary.\n\n\"I may disagree with Arizonans who voted for Joe Biden,\" Lake said. \"But I don't think you're a threat to democracy. You are a citizen just like me.\"\n\nAfter once calling Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell an \"old bat\" and saying he needed to be replaced as Republican leader, Lake now says she would support him if she's elected. Last year, she called abortion \"the ultimate sin\" and supported a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona. Now, she says she wouldn't endorse a federal abortion ban.\n\nNational Republican leaders think a GOP candidate could take advantage of what could be a three-way race if Sen. Kyrsten Sinema seeks reelection. Sinema, a former Democrat who became an independent last year, is preparing for a campaign but has not said whether she will seek a second term. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego is likely to have the Democratic nomination locked up.\n\nLake met recently with Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who leads the GOP's Senate campaign work as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and saw several other GOP senators during a trip to Washington. Daines has publicly urged Lake to focus on the future instead of relitigating past elections.\n\nA former television news anchor for nearly three decades in the Phoenix market, Lake was already known locally but had no national profile when she walked away from her career in 2021, declared \"journalism is dead,\" and took a sledgehammer to televisions showing cable newscasts.\n\nRight up to Election Day, she embraced Trump, appeared with right-wing figures like Steve Bannon and blasted establishment Republicans, including the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nShe lost the governor's race by less than 1 point. About four in 10 Arizona voters in the 2022 election said they were \"very concerned\" that Lake's views were too extreme, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of U.S. voters. She lost 11% of Republicans.

(AP Photo/Matt York)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Democrat Ruben Gallego has been elected Arizona's first Latino U.S. senator, defeating Republican Kari Lake and preventing Republicans from further padding their Senate majority.\n\nGallego's victory continues a string of Democratic successes for the Senate in a state that was reliably Republican until Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. Arizona voters had rejected Trump-endorsed candidates in every election since, but the president-elect won Arizona this year over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nRepublican candidate for U.S. Senate Kari Lake speaks to the media before voting, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in Phoenix, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York)\n\n\"Gracias, Arizona!\" Gallego wrote on the social platform X.\n\nWith Gallego's win, the GOP will have 53 seats in the 100-member Senate.\n\nLee esta historia en español.\n\nGallego is a five-term House member and an Iraq War veteran with an up-by-the-bootstraps life story that he featured prominently in his public appearances and ads. He will replace Kyrsten Sinema, whose 2018 victory as a Democrat created a formula that the party has successfully replicated ever since.\n\nSinema left the Democratic Party two years ago after she antagonized the party's left wing. She considered running for a second term as an independent but bowed out when it was clear she had no clear path to victory.\n\n\"Yes, he could!\" several Gallego supporters shouted in Spanish as he offered his first comments after the race was called.\n\n\"I will fight for Arizona in Washington,\" Gallego told the cheering supporters, saying that he would fight as much for the people who did not vote for him as the ones who did.\n\nIn his brief remarks, Gallego several times mentioned the single mother who raised him, crediting her with his success. He promised to work to fix what he said was the nation's broken immigration system, and would continue to fight for veterans and for women's reproductive rights.\n\nThe Associated Press left a voicemail and email message seeking comment from Lake's campaign Monday night.\n\nWith Gallego's win, there was only one more major race left uncalled in Arizona. The race between Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel for the 6th Congressional District remained too early to call.\n\nGallego ran ahead of Harris , suggesting a substantial number of voters supported Trump at the top of the ticket and the Democrat for Senate, a pattern seen in Sinema's victory and both of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly's wins in 2020 and 2022. Ticket-splitters also were decisive in the Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada Senate races this year, which Democrats won even as Trump won their states.\n\nAP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 4,000 voters in Arizona, shows Gallego did better than Harris with several key voting groups, while Lake did worse than Trump with those same groups.\n\nGallego won Hispanic men against Lake, even though Harris and Trump split them in Arizona, according to AP VoteCast. Young men were evenly divided between Gallego and Lake, even as they broke for Trump in the presidential race. And Gallego also captured a majority of non-white men with a college degree - a small share of the Arizona electorate - but they were about evenly split between Harris and Trump for president.\n\nMeanwhile, Gallego benefitted from the support of some Republicans and Trump supporters in the state, while Lake had less crossover support from Harris backers. AP VoteCast shows that about 1 in 10 Trump voters split their ticket to vote for Gallego, while very few Harris voters also chose Lake. Only about 8 in 10 Arizona Republicans voted for the combination of Trump and Lake, whereas about 9 in 10 Arizona Democrats voted for Harris and Gallego.\n\nLake was viewed more unfavorably than Gallego. About half of Arizona voters had a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion of her, while about 4 in 10 had an unfavorable view of Gallego.\n\nAnd while Arizona voters were about equally likely to say they were concerned that Trump and Harris' views were too extreme, voters were much less likely to say they were \"very concerned\" that Gallego's views were too extreme compared to Lake.\n\nThe son of immigrants from Mexico and Colombia, Gallego was raised in Chicago and eventually accepted to Harvard University. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and fought in Iraq in 2005 in a unit that sustained heavy casualties, including the death of his best friend.\n\nGallego maintained a significant fundraising advantage throughout the race. He relentlessly attacked Lake's support for a state law dating to the Civil War that outlawed abortions under nearly all circumstances. Lake tacked to the middle on the issue, infuriating some of her allies on the right by opposing a federal abortion ban.\n\nGallego portrayed Lake as a liar who will do and say anything to gain power. He downplayed his progressive voting record in Congress and leaned on his personal story and his military service to build an image as a pragmatic moderate.\n\nLake is a well-known former television news anchor who became a star on the populist right with her 2022 campaign for Arizona governor.\n\nShe has never acknowledged losing that race and called herself the \"lawful governor\" in her 2023 book. She continued her unsuccessful fight in court to overturn it even after beginning her Senate campaign.\n\nHer dogmatic commitment to the falsehood that consecutive elections were stolen from Trump and from her endeared her to the former president, who considered her for his vice presidential running mate. But it compounded her struggles with the moderate Republicans she alienated during her 2022 campaign, when she disparaged the late Sen. John McCain and then-Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nShe tried to moderate but struggled to keep a consistent message on thorny topics, including election fraud and abortion.\n\nLake focused instead on border security, a potent issue for Republicans in a border state that saw record border crossings during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. She promised a tough crackdown on illegal immigration and labeled Gallego a supporter of \"open borders.\" She also went after his personal life, pointing to his divorce from Kate Gallego shortly before she gave birth. His ex-wife, now the mayor of Phoenix, endorsed Gallego and has campaigned with him.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Linley Sanders contributed from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Swamp: Kari Lake in Angry Confrontation with Democrat at D.C. Elite Hang-Out\n\nIt's a Beast of a time in Washington. Donald Trump's D.C. reality show is full of new characters, plot twists, and cliffhangers, and the Daily Beast will navigate you through it. The 47th president won't need to drain The Swamp. It's all leaking here... Sign up for more of the secrets they don't want you to know. .\n\nWashington just isn't working out the way Kari Lake had planned-professionally or socially. The infamous bathroom-brawling election denier-and two-time loser for Arizona statewide office-thought she had landed the perfect gig in MAGAland.\n\nA former local news anchor, Lake was tapped by Trump in December to lead the Voice of America . At the time, she claimed she had no intention of turning it into a propaganda machine for the president. \"I'm not there to make it Trump TV and MAGA TV. That's not what this is about,\" she told CBS News in an interview at the time. \"That's not what Voice of America is.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLake, who lost both her 2022 Arizona gubernatorial race and 2024 Senate race, had won the perfect consolation prize: her own bullhorn. The possibilities were endless.\n\nThe VOA gig also provided Lake a fresh start in the nation's capital, a chance to rehabilitate her rabble-rousing reputation. (She has confronted her Senate Democratic rival, Sen. Ruben Gallego , outside an airport men's room; screamed in Bulwark journalist Tim Miller 's face, calling him a \"piece of s--t;\" and falsely accused the GOP Maricopa County, Arizona, recorder of \"intentionally sabotaging the election\" after she lost the governor's race.)\n\nBut now VOA isn't anything. At all. Trump eviscerated the nation's largest international broadcaster over the weekend, firing almost all employees and contractors, who were literally locked out of the building. Lake seemingly has nothing and no one to oversee.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, she seems to have been blackballed from Washington's toniest new private club, Ned's .\n\nLake has landed in hot water with members of the exclusive dining and meeting spot, whose clientele skews left but plays nice with the MAGAverse. Its owner, after all, is longtime Clintonista moneyman Ron Burkle .\n\nBut partisan tensions have risen to a steady Defcon 2, as Trump and Elon Musk demolish democracy, day by day, agency by agency, brick by brick. So what of the unsavory behavior on a recent evening at the club, which-gasp!-involved a certain phallic gesture? Well, we hear it has rendered the new Face of the Voice(less) of America persona non grata at Ned's. (Initiation, around $5,000, plus the same each year for membership.)\n\nThe Swamp sources say there was a tense exchange at Ned's between Lake and a companion who appeared to be her aide and someone else at the club who was thought to be a Democrat.\n\nLake's associate then let it fly: the middle finger. It was an awe-and-cringe moment that club insiders say violated decorum. To be fair to Lake and her bird-flipping associate, Ned's rules don't specify that giving anyone else the middle finger is forbidden.\n\nBut these things are bound to happen when MAGA mingles with lefty socialists...er, socialites. Worth noting: Ned's also doesn't allow firearms, another reason why Lake might not be the best guest to sneak in where she's not wanted. She told her supporters last year ahead of Election Day they'd better \" strap on a Glock .\"\n\nWhen contacted by The Swamp about the incident, Ms. Lake responded, \"I do not have an aide.\" Ned's Club has been contacted for comment.\n\nThis is just one of the brilliant exclusives from The Swamp.

      "text": "Kari Lake and Blake Masters Have 'Intense' Phone Call About Dueling Senate Intentions\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nAfter news broke in August that Blake Masters was considering another run for Senate in Arizona-potentially against his former ally Kari Lake -it seemed like a recipe for a MAGA mess.\n\nAs it turns out, even before either of them have actually jumped into the race, the mess is already here.\n\nOn Saturday night, around 11 p.m. EDT, Lake called Masters to have a conversation. Earlier in the day, The New York Times published a report revealing that former President Donald Trump had spoken to Masters about a week ago to discuss his Senate plans, and The Daily Beast had just published a story-only a few hours before the call-on how Masters may be having second thoughts about running.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSources familiar with the conversation said the call lasted about 10 minutes, describing the discussion as \"intense,\" \"paranoid,\" and \"erratic.\"\n\n(This account of the phone call is based on two sources who heard the conversation and two other sources who were briefed on the discussion.)\n\nThe call, which Lake initiated after speaking at a fundraiser in Florida, started with Lake pressing Masters on why he's been \"floating\" his name as a possible candidate for the Senate seat.\n\n\"Have your intentions changed?\" Lake asked Masters.\n\nMasters, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate last year, said he doesn't intend to run against Lake if she gets into the race. But he pressed Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in Arizona, on why she hadn't announced her Senate campaign yet.\n\nMasters said he thought Lake was \"wasting time\" by not announcing, according to one of the sources familiar with the call.\n\n\"You should have been in this race yesterday,\" Masters said, another one of the sources told The Daily Beast.\n\n(As The Daily Beast reported Saturday, Lake has been aiming to announce her Senate bid later this year.)\n\nThe phone call wasn't all advice. Among a number of spirited moments, there was plenty of score-settling. Lake said she and her campaign did as much as they could to help Masters in the 2022 race.\n\n\"And you ran and hid under the bed as soon as the election was over,\" Lake allegedly said, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe conversation quickly pivoted to who was the more viable Senate candidate. Lake allegedly asked Masters if he thought he could win the Senate seat. Masters said he thought he could, according to a source familiar with the call.\n\nLake then asked Masters if he thought she could win.\n\n\"No, I don't think so,\" Masters allegedly told Lake. \"Not based on what I've seen.\"\n\nPredictably, that set Lake off, according to the sources. Even though about 14,000 more people voted in the 2022 Senate election, Lake received more votes for governor than Masters did for Senate-1,270,774 to 1,196,308. Lake lost to now-Governor Katie Hobbs by less than 0.7 percent, while Masters lost to Sen. Mark Kelly by almost 5 percentage points, with the Libertarian candidate garnering 2 percent in the Senate race.\n\nWhile Masters' defeat was no doubt a major disappointment for the GOP, his Democratic opponent was recognized as one of the strongest incumbents in the country that year. A former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Kelly had already won a tough Senate race in 2020. And he raised nearly $90 million for his 2022 effort, more than every Senate candidate anywhere except for Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA).\n\nLake, meanwhile, was seen as the strong favorite to defeat Hobbs, who even some Democrats believed was running a weak campaign dogged by bad publicity. Since refusing to accept her 2022 defeat, Lake has only broadened her negative reputation, some Arizona insiders believe, perhaps making Masters the more favorable option for 2024.\n\nThat backdrop may explain why Masters was blunt about Lake's shortcomings Saturday night.\n\nMasters told Lake she needed to \"move to the center a little bit\" on \"tone, not policy,\" according to one of the sources. Masters also told Lake she needed to surround herself with people that \"have a little skepticism and don't just drink the Kool-Aid,\" this source added.\n\nHe also allegedly told Lake that he didn't think she'd been taking the Senate race \"seriously,\" noting that she's pursued other opportunities-like potentially being Trump's 2024 vice presidential nominee.\n\nSpokespeople for Lake and Masters didn't immediately return requests for comment, but according to these sources familiar with the call, Lake defended herself by saying she has never sought the VP nomination and that, contrary to news reports , she hasn't given much thought to the idea.\n\nBut Lake wasn't just on the defensive.\n\nThe former TV journalist turned far-right gubernatorial candidate claimed that Masters had turned to the GOP \"establishment\"-a dirty epithet for the MAGA faithful-and she rattled off the names of some mainstream GOP operatives who she believed were working for Masters.\n\nA source close to Masters claimed none of the names Lake tossed out were accurate.\n\nDuring the call, Masters reiterated that he wouldn't get into the race if Lake did.\n\n\"I'm not going to run against you,\" Masters reportedly said.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, Lake \"tried to be cool and suave\" about the call, but instead became \"rattled\" and \"defensive,\" while another source described Masters as \"angry\" and said the phone call was \"tense.\"\n\nBy the end of the conversation, neither side had much clarity on the intentions of the other, but the discussion ended in familiar territory.\n\nLake allegedly claimed she won in 2022, and pressed Masters on whether he agreed.\n\n\"Don't you think I won?\" Lake asked, according to one of the sources.\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

But he pressed Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in Arizona, on why she hadn't announced her Senate campaign yet.\n\nMasters said he thought Lake was \"wasting time\" by not announcing, according to one of the sources familiar with the call.\n\n\"You should have been in this race yesterday,\" Masters said, another one of the sources told The Daily Beast.\n\n(As The Daily Beast reported Saturday, Lake has been aiming to announce her Senate bid later this year.)\n\nThe phone call wasn't all advice. Among a number of spirited moments, there was plenty of score-settling. Lake said she and her campaign did as much as they could to help Masters in the 2022 race.\n\n\"And you ran and hid under the bed as soon as the election was over,\" Lake allegedly said, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe conversation quickly pivoted to who was the more viable Senate candidate. Lake allegedly asked Masters if he thought he could win the Senate seat. Masters said he thought he could, according to a source familiar with the call.\n\nLake then asked Masters if he thought she could win.\n\n\"No, I don't think so,\" Masters allegedly told Lake. \"Not based on what I've seen.\"\n\nPredictably, that set Lake off, according to the sources. Even though about 14,000 more people voted in the 2022 Senate election, Lake received more votes for governor than Masters did for Senate-1,270,774 to 1,196,308. Lake lost to now-Governor Katie Hobbs by less than 0.7 percent, while Masters lost to Sen. Mark Kelly by almost 5 percentage points, with the Libertarian candidate garnering 2 percent in the Senate race.\n\nWhile Masters' defeat was no doubt a major disappointment for the GOP, his Democratic opponent was recognized as one of the strongest incumbents in the country that year. A former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Kelly had already won a tough Senate race in 2020. And he raised nearly $90 million for his 2022 effort, more than every Senate candidate anywhere except for Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA).\n\nLake, meanwhile, was seen as the strong favorite to defeat Hobbs, who even some Democrats believed was running a weak campaign dogged by bad publicity. Since refusing to accept her 2022 defeat, Lake has only broadened her negative reputation, some Arizona insiders believe, perhaps making Masters the more favorable option for 2024.\n\nThat backdrop may explain why Masters was blunt about Lake's shortcomings Saturday night.\n\nMasters told Lake she needed to \"move to the center a little bit\" on \"tone, not policy,\" according to one of the sources. Masters also told Lake she needed to surround herself with people that \"have a little skepticism and don't just drink the Kool-Aid,\" this source added.\n\nHe also allegedly told Lake that he didn't think she'd been taking the Senate race \"seriously,\" noting that she's pursued other opportunities-like potentially being Trump's 2024 vice presidential nominee.\n\nSpokespeople for Lake and Masters didn't immediately return requests for comment, but according to these sources familiar with the call, Lake defended herself by saying she has never sought the VP nomination and that, contrary to news reports , she hasn't given much thought to the idea.\n\nBut Lake wasn't just on the defensive.\n\nThe former TV journalist turned far-right gubernatorial candidate claimed that Masters had turned to the GOP \"establishment\"-a dirty epithet for the MAGA faithful-and she rattled off the names of some mainstream GOP operatives who she believed were working for Masters.\n\nA source close to Masters claimed none of the names Lake tossed out were accurate.\n\nDuring the call, Masters reiterated that he wouldn't get into the race if Lake did.\n\n\"I'm not going to run against you,\" Masters reportedly said.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, Lake \"tried to be cool and suave\" about the call, but instead became \"rattled\" and \"defensive,\" while another source described Masters as \"angry\" and said the phone call was \"tense.\"\n\nBy the end of the conversation, neither side had much clarity on the intentions of the other, but the discussion ended in familiar territory.\n\nLake allegedly claimed she won in 2022, and pressed Masters on whether he agreed.\n\n\"Don't you think I won?\" Lake asked, according to one of the sources.\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

According to The New York Times , Gallego, with tears in his eyes, said at a press conference in Phoenix, \"For the kids sleeping on the floor, dreaming about a better, better America and a better, better future, this victory is for you.\"\n\nGracias, Arizona! pic.twitter.com/fWQ3AetOsy\n\nGallego, a Marine veteran who has served in the House since 2015, will become the first Latino senator to represent Arizona.\n\nThe loss marks back-to-back election defeats for Lake, who had not publicly conceded the race Monday night, though she did say she would accept the results while talking to reporters on Election Day.\n\n\"I have had a few concerns but we've done a lot of legwork to prevent any problems,\" Lake said.\n\nDespite losing her gubernatorial race in 2022, Lake never conceded and multiple attempts to overturn the results failed in court.\n\nNight Editor\n\nmatt.young@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump favorite Kari Lake wins Arizona's Republican Senate primary\n\nFar-right firebrand to face off against Democrat Ruben Gallego for US Senate seat vacated by Kyrsten Sinema\n\nKari Lake, the far-right firebrand and favorite of Donald Trump, has won Arizona's Republican Senate primary.\n\nThe Associated Press projected the race at 8.44pm Arizona time on Tuesday night. Lake rose to prominence as a gubernatorial candidate in 2022, when she r efused to concede the race to her Democratic challenger, Katie Hobbs.\n\nHaving secured a primary victory, she will face off against the Democratic US representative Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat vacated by the centrist independent senator Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nLake, endorsed by Trump, was widely favored to win the primary against Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county. Lamb, who has far less name recognition and campaign funding than Lake, pulled in about 40% of the vote as of Tuesday night - a potential sign of general election trouble for Lake, who has alienated the more moderate voters required to win statewide in Arizona.\n\nHer contest, along with several key down-ballot races, is considered a gauge for the relative strength of the Maga movement in a key swing state that has been racked with election chaos brought on by a far-right flank pushing false claims about election fraud.\n\nLake, a former news anchor who rocked on to the national stage by becoming one of the most ardent and telegenic faces of election denialism, once carried a sledgehammer on stage and told supporters she would use it on electronic voting machines.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quickly launched an ad against Lake, where she talks about how abortion pills should be illegal and brands her as a \"power-hungry liar who only cares about herself\". Gallego tweeted : \"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake. Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.\"\n\nElection prognosticators Sabato's Crystal Ball and the Cook Political Report rank the race as leaning Democratic, citing Lake's election denialism and belief in abortion restrictions as factors moving the race toward Democrats. Polling on the matchup between Gallego and Lake has generally shown Gallego up a few points over Lake.\n\nThe race is key nationally for the balance of power in the US Senate - Democrats need to keep it in their control to maintain their 51-49 majority in the chamber. It is one of few close races around the country expected to see massive funding and attention as November nears.\n\nFar-right election deniers starred in several other key Republican primary races. Abe Hamadeh, who repeatedly tried to have his loss in the 2022 attorney general election overturned and has spread conspiracy theories about election security, is leading in a crowded Republican primary in the state's deep-red eighth congressional district, where Trump made the rare move to endorse two candidates, including Hamadeh.\n\nHis Republican rivals included the venture capitalist Blake Masters, who Trump endorsed last-minute, as well as state senator and fake elector Anthony Kern, Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and political newcomer Pat Briody.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Finchem, who has still not accepted that he lost his bid for secretary of state in 2022 has the lead in a race against the relatively moderate Republican Ken Bennett for a state senate seat.\n\nIn Arizona's Maricopa county - which includes Phoenix - election deniers vied for positions that could give them oversight in future elections. Early results show a mixed bag for election-defending county officials.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, was behind in his race for re-election as of Tuesday night. He is falling behind Justin Heap, a state representative who will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughingstock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access and is in third.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nDebbie Lesko, an outgoing Republican congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January 2021, has a strong lead in the primary to join the county board of supervisors over another election denier, Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and recorder played a crucial role in 2020 standing up to pressure from Trump and his allies in their scheme to overturn the results of that year's presidential election.\n\nThe recorder and many board members have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. The pressure has remained intense in the lead-up to this year's elections, with errors such as printing problems in the 2022 election adding fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nAmid the threats and harassment, two supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election.\n\nFor Gates's seat, the moderate former state lawmaker Kate Brophy McGee is far ahead in the primary against Tabatha LaVoie, who said on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because: \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is trailing far behind Mark Stewart, a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart will not say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, is fending off a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\".\n\nOn the Democratic side, the former state senator Raquel Terán is trailing in her primary for Arizona's third district, for the seat that will be vacated by Gallego. A longtime organiser against anti-immigrant laws in the state, Téran focused her campaign on protecting abortion rights. Her main rival former city council member in Phoenix, Yassamin Ansari, had raised more funds and secured several key labour endorsements, and has the lead as of Tuesday night.\n\nAnd in what is probably his last unsuccessful bid for office, the former Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, notorious for his harsh immigration regime, was trounced in a local mayoral race to lead the Phoenix suburb of Fountain Hills. Arpaio, 92, was recently kissed on the cheek by Trump at a rally in Arizona. In his run for mayor, one of his main ideas was to make the town's eponymous fountain go higher ."

She did not seek re-election .\n\nWhile the presidential race polled neck and neck throughout the election , Gallego polled ahead of Lake by several points the entire campaign, an unlikely position for a progressive congressman trying to win a battleground state. Gallego also outperformed Lake in fundraising, giving him more local airtime and mailbox presence.\n\nIn the end, he edged out Lake with 50% of the vote to her 48%, while Trump easily beat Harris in the state.\n\n\"Gracias, Arizona!\" Gallego wrote on the social platform X. He planned to speak to his supporters during a news conference on Monday night. After Gallego's win, Democrats will have 47 seats in the 100-member Senate, versus the Republicans' 53, erasing Democrats' previous majority in the chamber.\n\nRepublicans flipped Democratic-controlled Senate seats in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Montana. In the latter three cases, defeated senators Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey and Jon Tester all polled ahead of Harris but could not overcome their states' shifts toward the Republicans.\n\nLake ran into trouble winning over moderate Republicans and independent voters, both needed to deliver a victory. Attacks she had made against the late US senator John McCain reverberated, and the so-called McCain Republicans split on supporting her.\n\nLake ran for governor in 2022 , losing to the Democrat Katie Hobbs. Lake has yet to accept the results of that election.\n\nRepublican efforts focused more on Trump's bid to swing the state back red after he lost there in the narrowest victory nationwide in 2020. Billboards financed by the Arizona Republican party that boasted of \" team unity \" did not include Lake. Instead, Trump was pictured alongside out-of-staters like JD Vance , Elon Musk , Robert F Kennedy Jr , Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard .\n\nSign up to Fighting Back\n\nBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Republicans there have run to the right of the electorate, creating an opening for Democrats to make a case to new residents and suburbanites who are shifting to the left.\n\nGallego was able to tell his personal story frequently in his campaign. He is the son of Mexican and Colombian immigrants, who was raised by his mother and worked odd jobs at meatpacking plants and pizza shops to earn extra money for his family. He then graduated from Harvard and joined the Marine Corps, deploying to Iraq as part of a unit that saw some of the heaviest casualties of the war.\n\nLake delivered the news as an anchor on the local Fox affiliate in Phoenix for decades, putting her in Arizonans' homes daily.

But according to a new book, Trump has regularly mocked Lake over how fervently she advances his election fraud lie .\n\n\"Lake's commitment to talking about fraud in the 2020 election would make even Trump laugh at times,\" Meridith McGraw of Politico writes in Trump in Exile , an account of the former president turned presidential nominee's years since leaving power. The book is due out in the US next week; the Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nAccording to McGraw, Trump told other Republicans seeking his endorsement they should be more like Lake.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what you ask Kari Lake about,\" McGraw quotes Trump as saying. \"'How's your family?' And she's like, 'The family's fine but they're never going to be great until we have free and fair elections.'\"\n\nCiting Trump \"friends and donors\", McGraw writes: \"One said, 'He was like, 'You could ask her, how's the weather?, and she'll turn it into the election. 'Oh, the weather in Phoenix is OK, but you can never have great weather unless the election is fair.'\"\n\nMcGraw also quotes a 2022 conversation between Trump and Blake Masters - now a US House candidate but then running for US Senate - that was recorded by a documentary crew.\n\n\"I heard you did great on the debate,\" Trump said, \"but had bad election answers, you've got a lot of support and you have to stay with those people.\n\n\"If you want to get across the line, you've got to go stronger on that one thing, lot of complaints about it. Look at Kari. Kari is winning with very little money, and if they say, 'How is your family?' she says, 'The election was rigged and stolen.' You'll lose if you go soft. You'll lose that base.\"\n\nTrump claims Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election because of electoral fraud. He did not.\n\nTrump's lie fueled the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021, but nearly four years on, Trump and candidates throughout Republican ranks still repeat it, and polls show majorities of Republican voters believe it .\n\nIn McGraw's words, Lake has long been \"one of the loudest standard-bearers for the election denialism movement\".\n\nA former TV anchor, Lake ran for Arizona governor in 2022, in a campaign heavily reliant on repeating Trump's claims of voter fraud in the sun belt state two years before, when a controversial Republican \"audit\" only increased Biden's margin of victory.\n\nBeaten by Katie Hobbs, Lake refused to accept defeat. She maintains the Democratic governor won through fraud.\n\nHaving switched to a run for US Senate, Lake - a former Barack Obama donor and campaigner - will face the Democrat Ruben Gallego in November, a contest that could decide control of the chamber.\n\nAssessing Lake's successful courtship of Trump, a man who nonetheless ruthlessly mocked her, McGraw writes: \"Believing - or at least peddling - Trump's falsehoods about the election would ... become a litmus test for Trump endorsement.\n\n\"And Lake, like many of those Trump supported, went on to be one of the loudest standard-bearers for the election denialism movement.\"\n\nWith Trump in Exile, McGraw offers a wide-ranging portrait of the former president's political moves since leaving power in January 2021, from surviving a second impeachment over the January 6 Capitol attack, to capturing the Republican nomination for a third successive election despite facing 88 criminal charges (34 resulting in conviction) and multimillion-dollar fines in multiple civil lawsuits.\n\nMcGraw therefore considers the brief rises and humiliating falls of a series of would-be Trump rivals.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn describing how Trump dealt with Ron DeSantis, the hard-right Florida governor who was for some time his strongest challenger, McGraw revisits a famous campaign ad in which DeSantis was depicted eating chocolate pudding with his fingers.\n\nThe ad was based on an anecdote about a flight with a donor on which there were no utensils. McGraw writes: \"The incident - gross and funny and strange - was gossiped about after the flight and quickly became part of Tallahassee lore.\"\n\nDeSantis dismissed the anecdote, saying: \"They're talking about pudding, and I'm like, 'Is that really the best you've got? OK, bring it on!\"\n\nBut the pro-Trump ad - which began: \"Ron DeSantis loves sticking his fingers where they don't belong\" - became a viral hit.\n\nFewer than 100 days from the 2024 election, McGraw's account of the sticky little episode seems surprisingly timely.\n\nAs Trump and his running mate, the Ohio senator JD Vance, face ridicule from Democrats and supporters of Kamala Harris for being \"weird\" in their beliefs and policies, particularly about gender and women's rights, some in Trumpworld have complained, saying such attacks distract from a proper contest of political ideas.\n\nBut McGraw reports that staffers from Trump's campaign and Super Pac deliberately set out to \"deploy humiliating psychological warfare\" against DeSantis and his campaign, leading to the pudding commercial.\n\n\"When discussing their strategy,\" McGraw writes, \"one Trump adviser referred to Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals\", a 1971 book influential on the political left.\n\nTrump's staffers, McGraw writes, homed in on \"Rule number five: Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. There is no defense. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.\"\n\nThe pudding ad, McGraw says, was both \"disgusting and clever\", its goal \"to get under DeSantis's skin and start signaling to the public that he was, well, strange \".\n\nAs Trump and Vance are now finding out, such tactics often work."

      "text": "Republicans with history of election denial battle in Arizona primaries\n\nKari Lake, who refused to accept her gubernatorial race loss in 2022, is now vying for US Senate - and other key races\n\nRepublican primaries across Arizona on Tuesday will test whether the far-right cadre focused on election denial still can win among their base, despite major losses in the 2022 primaries.\n\nThe state has been gripped with fights over elections for years, with candidates like Donald Trump and Kari Lake refusing to concede their respective races. These general election losses in 2020 and 2022 ended decades-long Republican dominance, delivering the governor's office and other top spots to Democrats.\n\nThe results could foretell whether Arizonans, particularly Arizona Republicans , are ready to move on from election denialism and the far-right flank that controls the state party. And that lesson could carry into November in the swing state, which Biden narrowly won in 2020 in an upset.\n\nLake, who lost the governor's race in 2022, is now running for US Senate. She faces Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county, but she is expected to win the Republican contest on Tuesday. The winner will face the Democratic representative Ruben Gallego. The seat is open after senator Kyrsten Sinema left the Democratic party and decided not to run for re-election, making it a top race to watch nationally for control of the chamber.\n\nGallego's run for Senate leaves a race for his House seat in a strong Democratic district, where the former state lawmaker Raquel Terán is facing the former Phoenix vice-mayor Yassamin Ansari.\n\nOther prominent Republicans who embraced election lies and lost their 2022 races are back in the mix now, too.\n\nAbe Hamadeh, who narrowly lost the attorney general election in 2022, is now in a crowded primary to fill the seat of Debbie Lesko, the Republican representative who will vacate congressional district 8.\n\nHamadeh has Trump and Lake's endorsements in the crowded field, though Trump made the late decision to also endorse Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel acolyte who lost in the US Senate race in 2022. Trump called Hamadeh and Masters \"two spectacular America First Candidates\". \"Blake Masters is a very successful businessman, and an incredibly strong supporter of our Movement to Make America Great Again - He is smart and tough! Likewise, Abe Hamadeh, a Veteran, former prosecutor, and fearless fighter for Election Integrity, has been with me all the way!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.\n\nThe primary field also includes Anthony Kern, senator and fake elector ; Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and Pat Briody.\n\nMark Finchem, who lost his bid for secretary of state and still has not agreed he lost, is trying to return to the statehouse, running against a more moderate Republican, Ken Bennett, for a state senate seat.\n\nSeveral Maricopa county offices with primary elections include people who either say the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen or will not say whether they believe the elections were valid.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, faces primary challengers who have questioned election results. Justin Heap, state representative, will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughingstock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and the recorder, which both play roles overseeing elections, stood up to intense pressure campaigns from Trump and his allies in 2020 and have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. Errors like printing problems in the 2022 election have added fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nThe county primaries could land election deniers or skeptics into roles overseeing elections. Two of the supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election, in part because of the threats and harassment. This assures that the board will not have the same makeup next year.\n\nLesko, the congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January, is vying for Hickman's seat. She faces Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University, who has spread false claims about elections, including the one where he lost a state superintendent race in 2018.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nFor Gates's seat, Kate Brophy McGee, a Republican former state lawmaker who, at times, voted against her party in the legislature, faces Tabatha LaVoie, who says on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nThe two other Republican supervisors face primary challengers who are farther right, especially on election issues.\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is facing a challenge from Mark Stewart, currently a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart won't say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, will need to beat back a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\". Ugenti-Rita faced accusations of sexual harassment from a female lobbyist after Ugenti-Rita claimed she was harassed by a state lawmaker who was ousted from the chamber over a pattern of harassment.\n\nIn the politically fraught state, some other races could also have widespread impact.\n\nDavid Schweikert, a longtime representative, has Republican challengers and a crowded Democratic primary in congressional district 1 because recent elections showed Schweikert to be vulnerable to a Democratic ouster.\n\nOn the right, Robert Backie and Kim George want to beat Schweikert, though he is expected to win the nomination. And on the left, contenders include Andrei Cherny, Marlene Galan-Woods, Andrew Horne, Kurt Kroemer, Conor O'Callaghan and Amish Shah.\n\nShawnna Bolick, a state senator who voted to repeal a territorial-era abortion ban and the wife of a state supreme court justice, will have to fend off a challenge from the right in what could be seen as a test for how Republican voters view abortion bans.\n\nAnother outspoken election denier, Wendy Rogers, is being challenged for her senate seat by David Cook, a relative moderate."

      "text": "The Dangers of Democrats Boosting MAGA Republicans\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe midterm strategy to fund Republican extremists in the primaries worked. Some fear it will strengthen the far right in the long term.\n\nIn July, just weeks before Arizona's gubernatorial primaries, the state Democratic Party sent an unusual press release. The message addressed a Republican primary, criticizing the outgoing GOP governor's handpicked successor, Karrin Taylor Robson, a real estate developer, in favor of her opponent, Kari Lake, a former TV news anchor backed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic release dryly thanked Robson \"for her longtime financial support to help elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot\" and described her past attacks against Lake for giving to Democrats as \"hypocrisy.\" Arizona Democrats insisted they were not spending on the race, but the email was widely interpreted by mainstream media and conservative outlets as an attempt to interfere in the Republican primary to boost Lake. Two weeks later, Lake pulled further ahead in polls and by early August won the Republican gubernatorial primary.\n\nLast week's election for governor was so close that it took almost a week to count enough ballots to call it. On Monday, Lake lost the general election to the Democratic candidate, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nThe Arizona race was one of several key primaries in which national Democrats boosted Republicans they deemed more or less unelectable - candidates like Lake who denied the results of the 2020 presidential election. In what was anticipated to be a brutal midterm cycle, boosting extreme candidates could, the theory went , help Democrats fare better in general elections.\n\nThe strategy ended up working in Arizona. Yet even in defeat, Lake and some of the other extremist Republican candidates still out-performed expectations. For some political observers who work with Democrats, the Arizona race shows how dangerous the strategy could be in emboldening anti-democratic sentiment and fueling polarization.\n\n\"The Democratic Party leadership should treat the rise of the authoritarian right as a real threat, not a talking point,\" Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party, said in a statement to The Intercept. \"Helping MAGA Republicans to win their primaries was reckless and irresponsible. I hope it doesn't come back to bite us all.\"\n\nNot every election where Democrats employed the strategy ended up as close as Arizona. The party scored resounding wins in governors' races in Maryland, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, as well as a crucial Senate election in New Hampshire.\n\nKen Snyder, a national Democratic campaign consultant with experience in Pennsylvania, who saw \"smashing success\" in Pennsylvania and Illinois, said, \"This time the tactic worked more often than it didn't.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn races where the gambit clearly worked, Democrats spent millions boosting Republican candidates. Though Democrats didn't spend to back Lake in the Arizona race, they did pour more than $53 million to back Republican primary candidates in races in California, Colorado , Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Nevada.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association spent $2 million to boost the primary campaign of Maryland Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Cox in a race that Democratic candidate Wes Moore won handily.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro's campaign raised eyebrows when it spent $840,000 on ads highlighting Republican Doug Mastriano's extremism during the primary; Mastriano told a local news outlet he'd have to send Shapiro a thank-you card for the ad. Shapiro won the general election by 800,000 votes. In total, Pennsylvania Democrats spent at least $1.2 million boosting Mastriano.\n\nSenate Majority PAC, a group aligned with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spent more than $3 million boosting the campaign of Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc in New Hampshire. Following a tight race, Bolduc, another 2020 election denier , lost the race to Democratic incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan.\n\nAnd in Illinois, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker used tens of millions from both his campaign and the Democratic Governors Association's coffers to help elevate far-right candidate Darren Bailey to the Republican nomination. Again, voters rejected Bailey and went heavily for Pritzker.\n\nConcerns over the high-dollar amounts were twofold. First, the extraordinary financial cost of backing extremist Republicans came as other struggling Democratic candidates have said they were spurned after requesting support from the party.\n\nIn addition, some Democrats worried that the push to boost far-right Republicans might alienate the party's donors. \"Historically, this has been a well-known tactic with minimal repercussions,\" said Lauren Tsuboyama, a Democratic strategist at the consultancy Blue State. Today, donors might not want to see their money going to extremist Republicans: \"Now, more than ever, voters - especially Democratic voters - are paying closer attention to where their hard-earned donations are being spent.\"\n\nAnother potential downside for Democrats could have been their chosen MAGA Republican candidates being defeated in their primaries. \"It looks like you're running against the person you feared the most,\" said Snyder, the Democratic consultant, noting that the more moderate GOP member would have a baked-in centrist narrative. That's not how it played out, though.\n\nIn Colorado, Democrats put just under $6 million into more extreme Republican candidates who lost primary races for governor , Senate , and Congress . Democrats nonetheless beat the more moderate Republicans in all three races.\n\nIn Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party fundraising organ, spent half a million dollars on ads boosting a Trump-backed candidate. The incumbent Republican, who had voted to impeach Trump last year, lost the August primary by 3 points, but Democratic candidate Hillary Scholten went on to win the race by 13 points anyway.\n\nFor a party that's had trouble crafting a coherent message around its achievements under President Joe Biden, Republican candidates touting election denials seem to have worked as an effective foil.\n\n\"While there is cognitive dissonance in this strategy,\" said Alyssa Cass, a Democratic strategist who worked on Democratic candidate Pat Ryan's competitive race in New York's 18th District , \"I'm not someone that shared the hand-wringing over it initially.\"\n\nConventional wisdom leading up to the election - including polling, guidance, and general advice for Democratic strategists - was that messaging to voters that democracy was under threat wasn't effective, Cass said. \"This election shows that that was really wrong,\" she said. \"Foregrounding Republican extremism wins Democrats elections. When you're devising campaigns, a really risky way to do that is by playing in those Republican primaries.\"\n\nA few hundred or a thousand votes the other way could have delivered a different outcome, Cass said, but the particularly grim political stakes this cycle played in Democrats' favor.\n\nMoreover, the dangers of stoking extremism and polarization, Snyder said, should be the responsibility of Republicans: \"Whose fault is it when a radical extremist wins a Republican primary?\" he asked. \"I think national Republican leaders need to look in the mirror for having created this dynamic in which candidates with extreme radical views can win their primaries to begin with.\"\n\nWAIT!

Devotees of digital currencies had cause to celebrate: An ally in Donald Trump had taken the White House and a slew of pro-crypto congressional candidates won races that included at least two Senate seats.\n\nOnly two years after the spectacular collapse of frauds like Sam Bankman-Fried ushered in a \"crypto winter\" in Washington , the industry wielded a $200 million campaign bankroll to buy itself back into D.C.'s good graces.\n\nCrypto-backed candidates were close to running the table in Senate races after the election of Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio and Democrat Elissa Slotkin in Michigan. The election of Trump, who has promised to make America the world's \"crypto capital,\" sent bitcoin prices soaring.\n\nOnly the undecided Arizona Senate race between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake left in doubt a total sweep in top-level races for favorites of the digital currency industry. The crypto candidate in that race, Gallego, was ahead in the count as Arizona continued to process the ballot on Wednesday.\n\nThe near-total victory put members of Congress and potential candidates on notice that if you don't take positions favored by the industry, crypto will come after you with millions, said Rick Claypool, research director at the progressive consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\n\"Now, the message that Congress receives,\" Claypool said, \"is very much that how you vote on crypto-related policy, those decisions are going to have consequences in terms of big crypto spending money for or against you.\"\n\nCrypto skeptics like Claypool warned that the results of the spending could soon be felt and that ordinary Americans would need to hang onto their wallets.\n\n\"In all likelihood, crypto deregulation is coming,\" said Claypool. \"People are going to have to be really careful about what they're doing with their money. It looks like a tragedy waiting to happen.\"\n\nThe results capped an extraordinary election that marked a new era for campaign finance with Citizens United, the 2011 Supreme Court decision, coming to full fruition.\n\nSince Citizens United, business interests have often funneled their money through \"dark money\" nonprofits. This year, however, the crypto industry was straightforward about its massive spending to boost supporters and blast opponents.\n\nThe industry raised more than $197 million and spent at least $133 million on federal races, according to campaign finance reports compiled by technology researcher and writer Molly White.\n\nThe money was split between Republican and Democratic candidates at the congressional level in the primaries, but heavy spending on Moreno in the race's final weeks tipped the overall balance toward the GOP.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown's defeat was a stinging loss for consumer advocates who had long found a vocal leader in the Senate Banking Committee chair. Moreno was a car dealer with little statewide profile but an enthusiastic blockchain booster, when the industry adopted him as its candidate.\n\nBrian Armstrong, the CEO of leading cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, celebrated the industry's wins on social media.\n\n\"Welcome to the new members of America's most pro-crypto Congress ever... 219+ pro-crypto candidates and counting have now been elected to the House & Senate.

The tens of millions of dollars the leading industry lobbying group, the Fairshake PAC, spent on Moreno and other candidates never mentioned crypto, instead seizing on issues like inflation and immigration.\n\n\"I don't think it's an endorsement by the voters of cryptocurrencies at all, because the millions they presented in ads to advance the crypto sector's interest didn't say a word about crypto,\" Claypool said.\n\nCrypto already scored a major victory in the House of Representatives this year when it won bipartisan support for its top priority, a bill to shift oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission to a regulator that is perceived as more industry-friendly, the understaffed Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe industry's victories in Senate races give it clear momentum when the new Congress takes office in January.\n\nEven without immediate action in Congress, crypto could see its most aggressive regulator defanged. Trump could replace crypto foe Gary Gensler as the SEC chair, although he could not fire him from the commission outright.\n\nCrypto investor Cameron Winklevoss celebrated the impending changeover on X.\n\n\"Imagine how much we are going to accomplish in the next 4 years,\" he wrote , \"now that the crypto industry won't be hemorrhaging $ billions on legal fees fighting the SEC and instead investing this money into building the future of money.

      "text": "Shock Poll Shows Independent Nebraska Union Leader Beating Republican Senator\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWith Senate control hanging in the balance, Nebraska Democrats are considering backing Dan Osborn in his challenge against Republican Sen. Deb Fischer.\n\nA Nebraska labor leader running for the U.S. Senate as an independent could best the Republican incumbent, according to a recent poll of voters in the Cornhusker State.\n\nDan Osborn, a 48-year-old military veteran who helped lead the 2021 strikes against food giant Kellogg's, launched a challenge against 72-year-old Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer in October. A poll conducted by Change Research, a liberal research firm, shows Osborn leading Fischer by a margin of 2 points. Nebraska has voted for a Republican president every year since 1964, and the survey, conducted in November, shows that respondents favor former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden by a margin of 16.\n\nOsborn's slight edge in the poll - 40 percent to Fischer's 38 percent - comes despite 59 percent of respondents saying they had never heard of him before. Fischer, meanwhile, has represented Nebraska in the Senate for a decade and sits on the influential Armed Services and Agricultural committees. In response to a question that described both Osborn's and Fischer's backgrounds, 50 percent of respondents said they'd vote for Osborn, while only 32 percent said they'd vote for Fischer.\n\n\"Nebraskans have had it with Washington. We've been starving for honest government that isn't bought and paid for,\" Osborn told The Intercept. \"This poll shows that Nebraska's independent streak is alive and well.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nDemocrats have so far not fielded a candidate in the Senate race. In October, shortly after Osborn's announcement, Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said state Democrats were considering supporting his bid. Kleeb told The Intercept that the state party would make an endorsement decision in February and that Osborn could win if \"the money is there.\"\n\nHe could appeal to populists and progressives, Kleeb said, with many Nebraska voters tired of one-party control in the state. \"Makes politicians lazy when you have only one party in control and more beholden to corporate interests since they don't have to answer to voters,\" she wrote.\n\nOsborn's candidacy comes as Democrats face a challenging battle next year to retain their razor-thin Senate majority. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., has announced that he will not run for reelection, all but guaranteeing a Republican pickup in West Virginia, while Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, are vying to defend seats in states Trump won in 2020.\n\nDemocrats are also defending seats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Arizona (where Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego seeks to beat Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation from Democrat to independent, and Republican Kari Lake in a three-way race), while Republicans are playing in defense in Florida and Texas, where they have had strong showings in recent statewide elections.\n\nOsborn has focused his campaign on labor and economic issues and the cross-partisan coalition he aims to build. \"I will bring together workers, farmers, ranchers, and small business owners across Nebraska around bread-and-butter issues that appeal across party lines,\" he pledged when he announced his candidacy.\n\nHis platform spans from raising pay for servicemembers and taking on agricultural consolidation to legalizing medical marijuana and pledging to \"never supporting handing huge pharmaceuticals a blank check.\" The independent also calls to reform railroad safety, with measures like requiring two-person crews and increasing fines for violating rail safety laws - mirroring some of the reforms that were floated after the disastrous Norfolk Southern derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, earlier this year.\n\nOsborn's platform appears to be popular among would-be voters in Nebraska. Pollsters asked a series of questions regarding his policy platform, after which 53 percent of respondents said they'd vote for him, compared to 30 percent for Fisher. Thirty-three percent of poll respondents were Democrats, 14 percent independent, and 53 percent Republican; 53 percent said they voted for Trump in 2020, while 35 percent said they voted for Biden.\n\nOsborn has served as the president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union Local 50G and garnered national attention two years ago when he helped lead workers in a strike against Kellogg's that lasted more than two months and also included factories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.\n\n\"It's exciting to be a part of something bigger than yourself, knowing that we're not alone,\" the 18-year Kellogg's veteran said at the time.\n\nIn his campaign launch video, Osborn spoke about the strike. \"Two years ago, I successfully led the strike to preserve 500 middle-class jobs here in Nebraska,\" he said. \"It didn't matter what party you belonged to. We came together to find solutions and move forward.\"\n\nDuring the strike, the company had threatened to replace all 1,400 workers. At its conclusion, workers won an agreement that included a $1.10 per hour raise, a new cost-of-living pay increase, and a pathway for lower-tier workers to \"graduate\" into a higher tier of pay.\n\nAs an independent, Osborn has no party structure to tap into for campaigning or fundraising. As of September 30, Fischer had $2.6 million on hand; Osborn announced raising $100,000 in two months as of November 16.\n\nCorrection: December 5, 2023 This article previously stated that Change Research commissioned the poll. Change Research conducted the poll but did not commission it.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Dmitri Mehlhorn: The Man Financing a Political Counterrevolution\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRyan Grim discusses political strategy with super PAC operative Dmitri Mehlhorn.\n\nThis week on Deconstructed, Ryan Grim is joined by Dmitri Mehlhorn, a tech executive who has emerged as one of the most powerful financiers in the Democratic Party and a strategist who often takes direct aim, with millions of dollars, at the party's left flank. He was in the news this week for helping finance E. Jean Carroll's defamation suit against Donald Trump. Mehlhorn and Grim discuss their competing views on political strategy, the best way to challenge Republicans, and the way forward for the party.\n\n[Deconstructed theme music.]\n\nRyan Grim: I'm Ryan Grim. Welcome back to Deconstructed.\n\nFirst, a big thank you to everybody who gave last week during our little pledge drive; very much appreciated. Today we're going to be talking about the future of the Democratic Party and competing ideas about how it ought to pitch itself to the country, what it should stand for, and how it can best stand up to Trump and the MAGA movement around him.\n\nNow, for that conversation, we're going to be joined by Dmitri Mehlhorn, who is a tech executive and an advisor to LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman, but is also his own man in democratic politics, and is one of those people in Washington that is influential enough that, when he gets talked about, it's just by one name: Dmitri.\n\nDmitri Mehlhorn: [Laughs.]\n\nRG: Dmitri thinks this, or Dmitri is funding that, and, very often what Dmitri is funding, is aimed at undermining the party's left flank, in order to - in his belief - make the party a more viable challenger to Republicans. And so, I wanted to have Dmitri himself on, so we could hear straight from him what he thinks the party's approach should be in 2024.\n\nDmitri, welcome to Deconstructed.\n\nDM: Ryan, it's a pleasure. And just to make sure that nobody misses this: My sainted mother, who is in her eighties, loves Ryan Grim. And if given the opportunity to choose who's right, she will always choose Ryan Grim over her own son.\n\nRG: Well, anybody with a mother that is that wonderful can't be all bad, so I'm very glad to have you on. And I'll be sure to send this out in my newsletter to her, so she'll be getting a copy of it, no doubt.\n\nDM: Excellent.\n\nRG: And so, before we get into it, can you tell us a little bit about your background, and how you wound up at the center of democratic politics?\n\nDM: [Laughs.] I'm not sure I'm at the center of it. My background: my parents met at U.C. Berkeley. My mom was a great-granddaughter of Jewish immigrants who had come to New York to flee the pogroms of late-1800s Russia and Ukraine. And she shows up in Los Angeles at UCLA., gets her graduate degree at UC Berkeley, and meets my father, who is a non-Jewish German war refugee who was bombed out of his home before he turned two, who eventually made his way out to California. And even though his aunts and uncles were members of the Nazi party, and thus had some culpability in slaughtering the other half of my family, when they met in Berkeley, they fell in love, and they had a child: me.\n\nAnd because of that history and because of the way it was shared with me, I've been very alert my whole life to the potential threat of somebody like Trump. I believe his example is a very common phenomenon in human history. And so, when he came along in 2015, I became quite alarmed. At the time, I was an early-stage angel investor, investing in a variety of small technology and data startups. And I began working, to the extent that I could, to get others to share my fear about Mr. Trump. And when he actually won the election, I realized that I could not do anything else other than try to get him to not win another election. And when I say could not do anything else, I meant, literally, I've tried to concentrate on something else, I couldn't concentrate, because I had so much fear about what a second Trump term would do.\n\nSo, I became active in that, and through social networks was reengaged with my former college classmate, who I'd known lightly over the years - Reid Hoffman - who shared my views of Mr. Trump, but had a great deal - a great deal - more money to fight. And so, he and I partnered up, and we have been active in anti-fascist politics ever since.\n\nRG: I characterized your politics very briefly at the top of the show, but how would you, in your own words, describe the strategy that you are trying to get the Democratic Party to emulate?\n\nDM: Ah, so, as a strategic - The only thing that I am focused on is making sure that Mr. Trump does not get another term of office. I believe that would be a catastrophic event. And if there's anything else that gets in the way of that, I'm opposed to that other thing. So that's the broad background.\n\nIn terms of how I believe that Mr. Trump should be defeated, I believe that the extremism that he represents needs to be the center of the conversation. And the Democratic Party needs to organize and focus on the ways in which his vision differ[s] from what 90 percent of Americans want.\n\nRG: And to you, is this a momentary strategy to deal with an immediate threat? Or would you see this as kind of the basis for a political party to organize itself around?\n\nDM: The former. There are a lot of people who believe - and you see it a lot - that Trump is a symptom, and that if we over focus on him, we will ignore the underlying disease. We are strongly in disagreement with that perspective. He is the disease.\n\nRG: And so, how do you think about the role of center-left parties in other developed countries? If you look at Europe and elsewhere, you've seen the kind of Clintonian type of center-left coalition basically collapse. You know, the bottom has fallen out of the center-left, and a lot of the center-right in a lot of places around the world. What makes you confident that the center-left here in the United States would be strong enough to stand up to a fascist movement?\n\nDM: So, on its own, it's not; the organizing principle should not be center-left, although that happens to be a fairly good characterization of my personal politics. But, by the way, it's probably worthwhile - since politics is all personal - it's probably worthwhile taking a step back. It is not merely that I am anti-fascist. I am currently professionally anti-fascist, but that is not the only thing I care about politically. I also am an extreme libertarian.\n\nSo, for example, on the issue of abortion, I believe that the government's ability to tell you what to do, ends at your body. And so, if some government official has some point of view about what some cells are doing inside your body, there's nothing they can do about it until those cells leave your body, at which point, maybe they have some rights. So, for example, substantively on that issue, I'm pretty strongly libertarian.\n\nThe thing that got me most upset about Mr. Trump was his assault on truth, but it was also his racism, and his assault on immigrants. Personally, in my point of view, I would probably be as quote-unquote \"left\" as many of your listeners on issues such as immigration, and criminal justice reform, and abortion rights. My view is also that none of that really matters if there's a chance that someone like Trump can get a second term in office. Because, the difference is between, say, my more-strong view on that versus someone who's maybe more moderate on that pales in comparison to the position that Mr. Trump would take.\n\nSo, when we're talking about the center-left, the center-left is one of many, many groups that need to be united to prevent fascists from taking power.\n\nRG: OK. So then, are you concerned that the kind of war the center-left has been waging - somewhat successfully, I would say, against the left flank of the party - is then going to undermine the ability of the coalition to come together at election time? Or are you concerned about what that does to turnout or enthusiasm? And if not, why not?\n\nDM: Great questions. So, there's so much about - When you use the analogy of a war, so much ends up getting - and I'm not saying it's the wrong analogy - but there's so much that ends up getting lumped into that. So, for example, you start asking, \"Well, who started the war? Who's fighting? On what grounds are they fighting?\" And so, the thing that I believe is that everybody, from AOC to Liz Cheney, needs to be a part of the coalition to prevent Mr. Trump from taking office again. And so, if AOC is spending all of her time energy attacking Mr. Trump, then she's on my team.\n\nThe reason we invested in groups like the Mainstream Democrats, who elevated Shontel Brown over Nina Turner, is we believe that Nina Turner was actually training her fire on somebody other than Mr. Trump; specifically, Mr. Biden, who was actually the center of our team. So, our decision to start investing in groups like Mainstream Democrats is a relatively recent phenomenon, and it came up after the exposure of working with these groups.\n\nSo, beginning in 2017 and 2018, when we were experimenting with different approaches to defeating the Trumpist movement, we actually put considerable investments behind fairly aggressive leftist groups. We supported open Socialists, for example, in the 2017 Virginia House of Delegates races, and some of them won. And in the 2018 midterm, we supported Richard Ojeda and Krystal Ball and the People's House Project. We supported the Progressive Campaign Change Committee. We were major early backers of Indivisible. We put a lot of money into these groups that anchored what is now seen as the left because we didn't know, and frankly didn't care, so long as they were on the same side.\n\nWhat we observed through the evidence of watching different races and monitoring them is that the more extreme leftist position did worse in the elections. You know, going hard-left cost us about one or two percentage points, which is decisive in a lot of these races, number one. And number two, people on the left were extremely enthusiastic about taking the fight in terms of salience and issues, in a way that we found to be helpful to Mr. Trump and hurtful to Trump's enemies. So, that's why we have moved the way that we have.\n\nRG: What do you mean by \"taking the fight?\" Like, what were they doing? You mean, taking the fight to the Democratic Party establishment?\n\nDM: So, first of all, a huge movement occurred in 2020 around George Floyd, right? Oh, actually, I'll give you three examples and you can pick them apart. Defund the police, as a movement out of the George Floyd protests was one example. The term Latinx was a second example. And Medicare For All was a third example.\n\nIn our view, the evidence was very clear that these three things were politically toxic in a general election, and, the less said, the better. And there were significant parts of the Democratic Party that were urging those issues to be central, important, salient issues in the election, and the entirety of the Republican Party was enthusiastic about that as well. So, you have the left wing of the Democratic Party and the entirety of the Republican Party elevating these issues, because these are issues that will help Republicans defeat Democrats.\n\nAnd so, we realized that, since no one in the Democratic coalition was willing to stand up to our own side and say, \"Guys, this is not working,\" we had to play that role.\n\nRG: I think you would probably find broad agreement on the Latinx point, from kind of left to center at this point.\n\nDM: OK.\n\nRG: And I think - other than a handful of folks who brought the phrase \"defund the police\" into electoral politics - you'd probably find agreement across the democratic political spectrum on that, too. What would you say to the criticism that it was actually the party's center that said \"defund the police\" a hundred times more than the party's left flank? And I think that was particularly true in the 2022 New York elections, where you'd constantly have people like Sean Patrick Maloney or others attacking fellow Democrats for using the phrase \"defund the police\" back in 2020, long after that phrase itself had lost salience among activists.\n\nDM: Yeah. So, I'm glad you're asking the question that way. It's the right way to ask the question, and it creates a complicated answer. The basic answer is that elections are decided by swing voters and what they hear. And what swing voters hear: paid media, what politicians pay to say, and what activists say, and what politicians themselves say has some impact on that, but it's very light. Maybe one unit out of 20, somewhere between one unit out of 20 and one unit out of a hundred. So, something like 1 to 5 percent of what a swing voter hears comes actually from the activists.\n\nThe rest of it comes from this viral ecosystem, this earned media ecosystem, this free media ecosystem. Like, how does our national consciousness move? And it's shaped by a lot of actors, good and bad, and you cannot fully predict it. However, you can draw patterns about things that are likely to be issues. And it is a fair assumption that the republican salient issues in '20 and '22 and '24, the top five issues that they will be trying to make top of mind for swing voters, one of them will be crime. One of the top five, maybe even one of the top three.\n\nAnd on crime, what are they going to say? And what they're going to say is that there is a currently sitting member of the Democratic Party in the United States Congress, who openly and expressly advocates for the end of funding to police forces. And there are quite a number of other Democrats who are in power now - in administration positions and in Congress - who don't agree with that extreme position of, there should be no funding of the police, but when asked if they believe in defund the police, will give a complicated answer other than, \"No, we should fund the police.\"\n\nNow, my friend, Anat Shenker-Osorio, who's another person that we have funded in the past, will tell you that if we say the words \"fund the police,\" that's bad, because it's increasing the salience of an issue. And if you run a poll, real-time, and you ask people, \"Hey, nothing else is going on in the world, it's more than a year away from the next election. I'd like you to take a poll,\" and you drop in the phrase \"fund the police\" out of nowhere that will probably raise the salience of crime in that survey. And you'll read the poll and you'll say, \"Ah, saying the words 'fund the police' or attacking the defund the police movement from the center-left - attacking the left - those things actually reduce the poll results that you get in this survey, a year and a half away from election day.\"\n\nWhat we believe is that the three months leading up to Election Day, and Election Day, is a particularly salient moment where people think about things differently. And so, what you really need to know is, in the three months before an election, and especially on election day, would they ordinarily be thinking about crime, and will they be alert to the possibility that members of the Democratic Party wish to remove funding from the police? If you believe those things are inevitable, then once a significant critical mass of the Democratic Party starts saying \"defund the police,\" you actually have to inoculate yourself, and you have to make sure that you're on record saying, \"fund the police.\"\n\nAnd yes, there will be some short-term irritation around that - just like a vaccine will give you some symptoms - but, once you have those symptoms, when people are cued to understand that you wish to fund the police in normal context - and especially if they remember it, because it's an unusual story, because it's a man bites dog,  a Democrat going away from their own party - once you do that inoculation, you are less vulnerable than you would be if you just let that thing spread like wildfire.\n\nAnd you may be right that, today, most Democratic Party activists agree that defund the police is not worth promoting. Both during 2020, and even throughout 2021, into December of 2021, when you made the argument that Democrats should not do that, you would still get a lot of pushback, with a lot of good arguments, but it was not a consensus then.\n\nDoes that sort of answer it, Ryan?\n\nRG: Yeah. You think you hadn't beaten it back enough yet, so it was still worth fighting, is what you're trying to say.\n\nDM: What I would say is, we still haven't. Yeah, what I would say is that, in an ideal world, Joe Biden would've said the words \"fund the police\" more slowly, more loudly, more often. And had he done so, we would've done even better in '22 and '20. But the democratic left was - Immediately after he said those words in his State of the Union, for example, Anat Shenkar-Osorio - who's widely respected, for good reason, as a messaging expert - sharply criticized him for having done so. And again, her basic argument was, if you pull people outside of an election context, that kind of language doesn't help the way they talk about Democrats in the polls. And that's just, in our view, a deeply flawed way of understanding how politics works.\n\nRG: Well, it feels a little unfalsifiable, in the sense that the place where the strategy was tried the hardest was New York, where you had New York, Cuomo, ex-Cuomo Democrats really going after the left and DSA, and constantly saying that we're not going to be as bad as these other bad Democrats are on crime. You know, we're not going to defund the police, we're going to fund the police.\n\nAnd New York was the most underperforming state, it feels like, anywhere. And so, it feels unfalsifiable, in the sense that your argument seems to be, if we'd have just done it harder, you know, like, more \"defund cowbell\" would have gotten us there. And who knows? Like, I can't say yes or no to that, but I can say that it was tried there, didn't seem to work in New York.\n\nDM: Yeah. You're making a couple of points that are really important. The first point, which is really, really frustrating for Democrats, and it's because Democrats, broadly speaking, are the party of facts and science, and so we want to measure everything. And so, one of the reasons why Democrats lose elections is because we try to only operate in areas that can be falsified. We only look for our keys where the light is. And each election is a sui generis thing, and there's some things you can just know - like this many mail pieces is better than that many mail pieces - but big lane-changing stuff, each election is its own cycle, and you don't know.\n\nAnd in particular, defund the police as a national call, and how that worked nationally, it's hard to know how that played down in New York, etc. What I would say is that candidates that took an aggressive fund the police position in 2020 tended to win their races, like Vicente Gonzalez, Abby Spanberger, etc. Pretty much every one of those frontline members of Congress said, \"I was getting hit at every town hall with defund the police, I was getting slammed with defund the police all over the place. I was only able to eke out a victory by aggressively articulating a fund the police position.\" And that's what they say. And it could be wrong. It doesn't show up in, you know, Anat's polls, but that's what they say.\n\nIt's also like, if you're looking at New York as an example - you know, that's a multi-party primary with ranked choice voting - the fund the police answer won. I mean, Eric Adams is mayor.\n\nRG: Well, that may be the case that he won there. There were some bizarre scandals that knocked out his opponent.\n\n[Crosstalk.]\n\nDM: A hundred percent. Yeah, New York state in general...\n\nRG: And Brandon Johnson just won in Chicago. And Helen Gym might win in Philadelphia.\n\nDM: Yeah. But Chicago is not a ranked choice voting state, is it?\n\nRG: No, it is a runoff. Yeah.\n\nDM: And it was a Democratic primary, right? Or no?\n\nRG: Well, It's top two.\n\nDM: Oh, it's just top two.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nDM: OK. So that's fair enough. So that is an example where the fund the police versus the defund the police was tested. And yeah, the fund the police, in the Paul Vallas case, the fund the police position lost to Brandon Johnson. So you're right about that.\n\nRG: Let's go back to the abortion politics that you mentioned.\n\nDM: Yes.\n\nRG: You and I were emailing about this, and I was surprised to hear your position on how to run on Dobbs and Roe. And so, rather than me articulating it for you, how do you think Democrats ought to approach politics of abortion in 2024?\n\nDM: The same way that I think they should approach every salient issue, which is to point out that the Republican Party is absolutely controlled by a fringe that represents a position that is anathema to 90 percent of the country. The Republican Party cannot distance themselves from that position, they're deeply interlinked with that position. And therefore, those people should not be given the power to put that position into law.\n\nSpecifically in the case of reproductive health, politically, I would say, in general, you can just map out the country who agrees with what. There's about a third that's broadly pro-life, there's about a third that's broadly pro-choice, there's about a third that's kind of in the uncomfortable European middle, of like, some but not others, and that's kind of where we are as a country.\n\nAnd while Roe was law, the Republicans could basically run to gather the pro-life votes, and they could also appeal to that uncomfortable center. And they could even appeal to the pro-choice folks, because the pro-choice folks would know that Roe was a backstop. And so, if the pro-choice folks happened to agree with Republicans on some other issue, like economics, they could swallow the abortion thing because it wasn't real. That's what happened until Dobbs.\n\nOnce Dobbs happens, you have the ability to make the debate. Like, what is the part of the debate that the Republican Party cannot disavow? And in the Wisconsin race, what the Wisconsin Democrats did, and what Governor Evers did, and Ben Wikler did, is they focused, they locked in on - I think his name was Michels? Was that the Republican nominee?\n\nRG: Mm-hmm. Michels. Yeah.\n\nDM: Yeah. They locked into the Republican nominee, they got a mic in his face right after he won the nomination, and they made sure that they understood his point of view about the Wisconsin snapback law, which did not have exceptions for that sort of thing. And so, once Michels was immediately on record suggesting that minors should be forced to carry their rapist pregnancy to term, all of the ads were about that.\n\nDid you see the ad that won those awards in Wisconsin?\n\nRG: This is the Ben Wikler ad?\n\nDM: Well, I don't know if it's \"the Ben Wikler ad,\" because he obviously touches all of this Wisconsin stuff, but he was very active in making sure this ad happened, as did others, and we were active in making sure it got financial support. But the idea was, it was just a series of young girls, age 12, having fun, and then the voiceover changes and the atmospherics change when the discussion is, some of them will be raped, some of them will be impregnant, and Michels wants to force them to actually bear their rapists' children.\n\nAdvertisement voice over: A 12-year old girl can't legally drive a car. At 12, she can't even vote. But if this little girl were tragically raped or a victim of incest and became pregnant, radical Tim Michels would force her to deliver the baby.\n\nHe said, it's, \"Not unreasonable for the state government to mandate rape victims to give birth.\" Would it be unreasonable if he were forcing this on you? Let him know on election day.\n\nDM: That is the winning play. Because the thing about the Republicans now, we have some trouble standing up to our left. You know, I fund Shontel Brown, and a bunch of the left is like, \"Oh, how horrible.\" But we are able to have debates between the center and the left. On the right, that's not available. There is no one on the right that can disavow the pro-life extremists, which is why you get someone like Tudor Dixon in Michigan.\n\nI met. Governor Whitmer for the first time in 2019, and we all thought she had a good chance of losing. She cruised, and part of it was that she was running against someone who said that forcing a 14-year-old to bear her rapist child was a gift from God, and she couldn't disavow that. Abortion is a super salient issue. On average, one of these swing voters who might change their mind is going to be thinking about abortion as one of their top issues, and one of the two candidates is openly saying that they're going to force this young girl to bear her rapist child.\n\nThat's ballgame, and that's what we should be replicating. As long as the Republicans are harboring that kind of insanity, we should make sure they pay for it.\n\nRG: And to me, if you have an opponent who is saying something that is that insane, it only makes perfect sense to highlight the fact that they are saying that completely insane and extreme thing. I guess the question then is, what does that mean for what the Democrats are going to say that they're going to do when they get into office?\n\nBecause what's really struck me about the post-Dobbs moment is that you saw, almost for the first time, people surging into politics who had been disaffected in the past.That's kind of like the Bernie fever dream of politics that he, you know, he ran his campaigns on the idea that, by exciting disaffected voters with an agenda that is populist and popular, and is going to take on the elites, that you're going to bring people into politics that weren't involved in politics before.\n\nNow, that didn't really pan out for him, so that kind of theory collapsed. He actually did better in caucuses and other states where turnout was lower. AOC, you know, upset Joe Crowley in a race where, like, 25,000 people, or something, came out and voted, so it ended up being something of the opposite. But then, when you had the case of Dobbs, and people felt that participating in politics could materially improve their lives, could defend a right that was taken away - Which, in some ways, is what Sanders was trying to get them to do. It's to say, look, if you participate in politics, you will be able to materially improve your lives.\n\nI think he was not able to convince anybody. He was not able to convince enough people that their participation would actually improve their lives. But people seem to get it on their own after Dobbs. You know, with Democrats kind of flat on their back, you had the White House, even with six weeks heads up that the Supreme Court was going to overturn Roe, was still caught flatfooted when they finally did it. Yet voters in Kansas kind of surged to the polls. You saw voter registration among young people, among women, even among men, increasing at substantial rates. You saw huge turnout in Kansas, and a blowout victory for abortion rights advocates, in a race that people thought they might win, or might lose, thought it was going to be very close. Instead, it's a landslide.\n\nAnd then, in every other state where there was a chance that people's participation in politics would actually do something good when it came to abortion rights, you saw turnout surge, and you saw that position sweep, even if it was in Montana. You know, forget Kentucky, as you mentioned, Michigan.\n\nIn states where people didn't feel like abortion rights were under threat - say, like, New York - you didn't see the same surge in voter registration and voter turnout. So, should Democrats still say, we are going to codify Roe v. Wade, but they just should be quiet about it and focus on the extremism of Republicans? Because, if that's your position, maybe I'm comfortable with that. But, do you think that Democrats running on codifying Roe is a bad idea?\n\nDM: So, I think running on codifying Roe is a bad idea, and I think that the words you just said, when taken together, explain why.\n\nBasically, you said Bernie believed that you could turn a bunch of people out by getting them to believe that being involved in politics could make their life better, and that didn't really pan out for him. And you talked about other examples, and there are many, many others. And by the way, I was open to that idea, as I said. It turns out it's not true. You cannot get people to vote by getting them to believe that voting and participating will materially improve their lives. It does not work, ever. Ever.\n\nThere are occasions when the right kind of candidate can catalyze a social movement that then leads to turnout - like a Barack Obama case or maybe a Bill Clinton case - but, fundamentally, these guys are centrists. What you can get people to get really excited about is: if you participate in politics, you might be able to prevent something really bad from happening to you.\n\nSo, imagine you're the average voter, and you're saying, OK, there are three things you can choose to believe about politics, and adjust your behavior accordingly. One, politics can do nothing for you. Two, politics can make your life better. Three, politics can make your life worse. People will believe the third. They normally default to the first, but they will believe the third. Within a rounding error, for electorally viable purposes, nobody believed the second, other than Bernie and his staffers and, you know, some other folks. It doesn't work that way. I wish it did. It doesn't.\n\nThe conversation about, for example, immediately after Dobbs, if I had been the Senate majority leader, I would have put a series of votes on the floor forcing the Republicans to confront their own extremes. The very first one would've been, \"no minor should be forced by the state to carry her rapist pregnancy to term.\" The second would be, \"no adult should be penalized for helping a minor exercise their reproductive rights.\" The third could be, \"no woman of any age should be forced to carry her rapist's. And just keep on going.\"\n\nAnd this puts the Republicans in a terrible position, because you would not- Even the one about banning, just saying, nationally, \"no one in this country who's been raped, who's a minor, should be forced to carry her rapist pregnancy to term,\" even that one would not get a hundred votes. There would be a good solid 10, 15 votes on the far, far right of the caucus who would vote for that. Maybe more. And then they would have to explain that, and that would be the news.\n\nAnd the reason this is important, Ryan, is because politics does affect salience, and does affect news coverage. The specific issue of minors being impregnated, that happens in this country, in every state, all the time. Right now, every single state in this country has a woman, a girl, under 17, a minor, who is carrying a pregnancy that was put there by a rapist. Every state in this country. And the news doesn't cover it, normally, because it's background noise. It happens all the time, has happened for centuries, forever. The news will start covering it only if it becomes a salient issue, which it became after Dobbs. And once that becomes an issue, you have all of these Republican figures in media and politics explaining, \"Oh, that didn't really happen, that couldn't happen.\" And then, actually, yeah, it does happen. So, do you defend it or not?\n\nAnd when the Democrats were considering whether to do this kind of work on the Senate floor to expose the extremism in the Republican Party, they chose not to, because Democrats were concerned that Republicans would simply use this to de-extremize themselves. They would stand up and, you know, Adam Laxalt might say, \"Oh, I would vote for that Schumer bill,\" and therefore, Cortez Masto would not be able to use Dobbs against him. That was the theory.\n\nAnd what I think that misunderstands is, it just doesn't understand the way that politics has turned in the last few years. It is impossible, in my view, for Adam Laxalt, or any Republican, to disavow their extremists, because the extremists have become the critical part of their coalition. They control the state and local party, they cannot be disavowed. And so, if you go extreme, it's not that, suddenly, they're going to use your symbolic vote as a way to position themselves as moderates. They're going to be screwed, unless we decline to take the option, which we did.\n\nSo, instead, the bill that we put up for discussion was a bill that literally united every single Republican Senator in opposition - which was to codify Roe, with some other stuff - and they also got Joe Manchin. So, rather than a bill that would've been a 90 to 10 debacle that would have forced them to explain their extremists, it's like, oh yeah, both sides, the Democrats have a bunch of extreme positions on abortion as well. It's the worst possible choice.\n\nSo, to win elections, you don't codify Roe, you codify not-extreme. You force the vote the way that the Kansas ballot initiative was, force the vote on the extreme Republican position, and Democrats will win - like in Kansas - by substantial margins, and you'll have things like the Democratic Governor of Kansas winning reelection, because she made it about the Republican extremists.\n\nRG: But you had Warnock and Fetterman, both proud champions of abortion rights, of saying that they would codify Roe - or even beyond codify Roe, actually - if they got into the Senate. So, why do you think that that didn't hurt them? Or maybe my question is: Are you against them actually codifying Roe, if they take power and can eliminate the filibuster? Like, do you think that would be a political mistake, and that they're better off being able to kind of beat up Republicans with the issue?\n\nDM: Well, I want to really separate out two issues. One is, what should Democrats or anyone do in governance to make the country better and serve their constituents? Versus what is the way to win an election? Those are different things in my view.\n\nIf Democrats have a governing majority that allows them to do whatever they want on abortion, I still think you can get to codifying Roe, just get there in a series of steps. I guess I would put it this way, Ryan: when you're thinking about the aggregate epistemology of the country, and where we are going as a country- There's a new book out called \"Gradual\" that's very good. There's a book that came out not that long ago by David Graeber, who's now passed, \"The Dawn of Everything.\" And what you see is that human societies move very much in opposition to each other, people separate themselves from each other. And in a time of great uncertainty like this where the boundaries are all over the map, the way that you legislate effectively is you start by saying, \"OK, can we at least all agree on 'X' as a starting point?\" You start that way.\n\nAnd in the case of abortion, like, \"OK, can we at least agree that minors should not be forced to carry their rapist pregnancy to term? Good? We're all good with that. OK. How about this?\" And you just keep going. And where you end up might look a little bit like Roe, might be better than Roe. Might be a little worse, might be better in some ways, worse in others, but that's what you're trying to go to.\n\nRG: But, because Warnock and Fetterman won on as strong champions of abortion rights, the Senate now is controlled by a majority that is pro-codifying Roe. I guess I'm trying to figure out -\n\nDM: Step one is: Make it clear that, under federal law, any minor who has been impregnated - and therefore, truistically [sic], definitionally, is a rape survivor - any minor who is pregnant as a result of that rape should be given all the healthcare she needs to end that pregnancy if she needs and wants to, needs or wants to. And no adult should be prevented from helping her, or punished in any way for helping her do that.\n\nYou could start there, that doesn't preclude you from doing anything else. But why wouldn't you start there? Why wouldn't you just get the 90 votes, bank that, and then, how about, what's the next thing? This kind of steady approach of marginalizing the extremes will likely get you to the same place, legislatively. But in terms of the governing majority, remember, under the current rules, you need 60 votes. This is not going to go in through reconciliation.\n\nAnd you're not going to get 60 votes to just codify Roe. You know, it's just too complicated of a decision, it was too cumbersome and too mixed in its popularity. You're not going to get there. So, why not get what you can, protect the people you can, protect all those girls, every single state, rather than going for it all, and risking it all?\n\nAnd by the way, again, going for the first step of marginalizing and excluding the extremes, in my view, does not preclude then doing more. In fact, it makes it more likely.\n\nRG: So, to you, does the victory by Fetterman, and the victory by Warnock, and Ossoff, previously, who ran on pretty progressive platforms - Now, they didn't use the phrases \"Medicare For All,\" they didn't use the phrase, \"Green New Deal.\" Fetterman had previously supported Medicare For All, never denounced Medicare For All, but, if you looked at his new campaign site for 2022, Medicare for All wasn't on there. But the language was very similar.\n\nBut, up and down, these were not your 2012 or 2006 democratic Senate candidates - Blue Dogs, new Democrats - who were picking some Republican issues and picking some democratic issues, and portraying themselves as centrists. They were pretty unapologetic progressive candidates, and they won. Does that change how you think about what's possible in a winning coalition? Because there could be some type of compromise there, between the left and the center-left, that if Warnock and Fetterman are going to be the party-type candidates in purple States, the left wouldn't have a whole lot to complain about.\n\nDM: All right, well, there's a bunch bundled in there that's worth talking about, and I'll try to limit myself to the things that might be of greatest interest to you and your audience. First of all, issues themselves play a very, very small role in determining elections. If you are focused on winning an election, and you just want to win an election, for the purposes of math, you basically ignore the people who are going to vote anyway, on the Republican side and the Democratic side, and you focus yourself on the people who might vote either way.\n\nThese are the legendary swing voters. A more accurate way of describing them that's more precise is that they're partisan bystanders. So, negative partisanship is not so dominant in their thinking that it prevents them from switching between one major partner and the other. That's about 10 percent of the electorate. And then there's people who are marginal in their decision whether to vote or not. Whether it's the sort of rural non-college whites who were brought out by Karl Rove's 2004 anti-gay initiatives or college students who were brought out by enthusiasm for Barack Obama or whatever.\n\nYou know, those are the only issues. Those are the only groups that you care about winning elections. And frankly, if you care about Trump, you only care about those groups in swing states. Those groups don't care about political issues or policy issues. The random marginal voter who's making a decision about whether to vote for Mehmet Oz or John Fetterman - Like, if we were to take everybody whose votes were conditional, like people who voted who were thinking about maybe not doing, people who didn't vote - who thought about it, but decided not to - and people who decided their votes at the last minute, I would venture to guess that zero of them made the decision because of what Fetterman said on his website about abortion.\n\nIt was much more identitarian, much more, \"Do I basically trust this guy? Do I trust him enough to overcome my prior that all Democrats are evil? Do I trust...\" you know, etc., etc. In the Fetterman case, we seriously considered putting a lot of support behind Conor Lamb because we thought he'd be a stronger candidate against Mehmet Oz.\n\nRG: He was begging for it, publicly.\n\nDM: Oh yeah.\n\nRG: Begging for a super PAC intervention. Yeah.\n\nDM: Oh yeah. And basically, we decided that Fetterman's attributes outweighed his downsides, in our view. So, his attributes in this identitarian fight were that: He was tall, he had tattoos, he wore baggy shorts. He was a very physical candidate. If he hadn't had that stroke, I think he would have crushed Oz, because his physicality really impressed people.\n\nAnd if you looked at focus groups of swing voters in Pennsylvania and asked them about - including Republicans - and asked them about Fetterman versus Oz, Oz was from New Jersey, he was effete, he was college-educated, he was rich, he was Turkish. Fetterman was active, had tattoos, was relatable, was strong. That's what they cared about. Now, if Fetterman had instead taken the abortion position that I'd recommended, rather than the more aggressive one that he'd taken, would that have cost him any votes? In my view, probably not. Because there was no way that that was going to be the central issue for those voters.\n\nIn a race where you've got Oz, and Shapiro, and all these other folks going on, in Pennsylvania, the gift to Democrats in Pennsylvania was that the Republicans nominated Doug Mastriano. And in Michigan, it was that they nominated Tudor Dixon. And those people - by virtue of their extremism on many issues, including abortion - made the debate about abortion where it needed to be.\n\nRG: The risk, to me, about this kind of politics - I'm curious for your take on this - is that it then winds up electing a Democratic Party that doesn't do anything. Because, I mean, that's ultimately what I care about. Maybe I'm - well, I think polls show I clearly am in the minority - but what are we in this for, if we're not in it to make the country a better place?\n\nAnd so, if the issues don't matter one way or the other, why not at least have a robust agenda that you plan to accomplish? And then go ahead and beat up your opponent for being an extremist nut job who wants forced birth for 12-year-olds, but then, when in power, actually do things that people like.\n\nDM: So, a couple of things. There's two broad things about this. Well, actually, let me start with the more important point for the purposes of this conversation, which is winning elections. If the debate is fundamentally about, Mastriano is crazy and Oz is a carpetbagger, then, yeah, it doesn't really matter what your issues are. But If you add them up, it can be a lot, right?\n\nSo, maybe you get a little bit more progressive? It's not enough to break through. But the further and further you go down the progressive route, the greater the risk is that you open yourself up to an attack that actually loses you the election.\n\nSo, for example, one of the groups that we pay close attention to is the group of folks on the democratic side who monitor the efficacy of television advertisements, right? And they monitor it in the way that I was dismissing earlier, which is that you insert the television ad into an otherwise banal set of online engagement, and then you test whether the ad effectively changed people's views. So, you do an in-survey placement, you ask people at the beginning of the survey, you ask people at the end of the survey. In the best designed versions of this, you then follow those same people and ask them again a week later. And you do all that, and you try to say, like, OK, did this content move people? It's not perfect, because the salience is so different from the election, but it's one of the least bad things we have, so we do that.\n\nBased on that, the Republicans did something in 2022 that previously Democrats did. So, Democrats in 2016 ran a bunch of ads that made Democrats feel good, made democratic donors feel good. These were ads about how Trump was a dangerous jerk. And in retrospect, it appears pretty likely that those ads elected Trump, because the electorate wanted a dangerous jerk. And so, if we had taken the hundreds of millions of dollars we'd spent on those ads, and spent them instead on a big national party on something entirely different, Hillary Clinton would be president. Like, those ads elected Trump. And we did it because we were appealing to our own donors and activists, rather than really paying good attention to what the voters potentially wanted.\n\nThe Republicans appeared to have done the same thing in 2022. They ran on crime and the border - and a little bit on Chris Rufo identitarian stuff - but they ran on crime and the border, and wokeness and whatever. Our analysis - and by \"our,\" I don't mean just, you know, Team Dmitri, I mean the entire Democratic Party that has an operation assessing this stuff - showed that we were vulnerable on abortion. If the Republicans had spent more money explaining that they were not abortion extremists, then the post-Dobbs energy could have cost us a few of those seats. If Kari Lake had run those ads, she would be the governor, and we would be in a world of hurt because of it. But they didn't, because they believed crime was better, and it wasn't. But the more you go into places that it looks really likely that the place you are could actually lose you some votes, the bigger the risk is that you take.\n\nNow, going to the second point that you made that I think is quite important is: why get involved in politics? You want to do things. I would just say to you - and this is the point of the David Graeber book, about \"The Dawn of Everything\" - being not another thing can help you be a thing, right? If you are not the extremists, that has implications for governance, right?\n\nSo, just taking this specific example, there are women all over the country - girls all over the country - who are dealing with a pregnancy caused by a rape. And if you can get into office, and forcefully and unambiguously give them rights, you have done a good thing for them. Even if your motivation was to stop the extremists, that's good. And once you've done that - I mean, you know the whole girl effect thing that was at Nike - like, once you have enabled these girls to have a normal life rather than being saddled with that, all sorts of downstream positive effects happen.\n\nA similar example, by the way, we've talked a lot about abortion, but like, guns, right? There's a mainstream position on guns, there's a Democratic position on guns, there's a lot of positions on guns, but there is also a 90 percent position on guns, which is background checks. And you could imagine an entire campaign just around the first four words of the Second Amendment, a well-regulated militia means you don't put powerful weapons in the hands of people with severe mental illness. The only way you find that out is background checks. It's got 80-90 percent public support. That could be the issue, and if we pass that, it would be a good thing.\n\nNow, are there other things that might be good, like, you know, an assault weapons ban or whatever? Sure, sure. But it is still an objectively good thing to have background checks.\n\nSo, your point, that you want to get into office to do good things, I would just make the gradualist plea that stopping really bad things is part of doing good things.\n\nRG: I guess another way of making my point would be that we're not talking about any of this in a vacuum. You know, Trump didn't come from nowhere - although this gets back to your symptom-or-disease question - but if the country is coming apart at the seams, it feels like, at some point, you're going to run out of duct tape trying to keep it together. And the tricks aren't going to work anymore, and you're going to become overwhelmed. Because the idea that Trump is the disease himself, to me, is undermined by the fact that you've got Trumps popping up everywhere you look around the world.\n\nAnd so, to me, if the left and the center-left don't come back with a forceful kind of recreation of a better world that stems the tide of this rising fascist energy, at some point they're going to be over overwhelmed by it, no matter how kind of popular, and clever, and, you know, 80 percent you can make your issues that you're running on.\n\nDM: Yeah. It's a good argument and a good question, Ryan, and I guess I would put it back to you this way: The history of humanity, as well as the history of the United States of America, is full of figures like Trump. Every human being, even you, even me, everyone on this podcast, every listener, every nation, every family, every tribe, we all have good and evil in us, all of us, because we're human. And the particular kind of evil that Mr. Trump represents is a common kind of evil in human history. His governance style is, up until about three or 400 years ago, that was the norm. You know, total control of truth and what counts as truth. Absolute tribalism and misogynistic violence. Use of power to reward friends and hurt enemies; this is what Carl Sagan called \"The Demon-Haunted World.\" It existed up until the founding of America. And guess what? When America was founded, it continued.\n\nIf you look at the American South, between the Compromise of 1877 and the Civil Rights Movement, roughly half our country was governed the way that Trump would govern in a second term, which would be the use of violence to make sure that his side stayed in power for decades, right? This is all familiar.\n\nThe reason why I say that Trump is the disease is, until Trump came along, there were a lot of things that were outside of the Overton window of U.S. politics. Especially, you know, there's been a particular moment in the last 50 or 60 years, since the visual evidence came out of the Holocaust in the '40s and '50s, and the visual evidence came out of the American South in the '50s and '60s about how abusive, the Bull Connor stuff. And there became a consensus for about five or six decades that certain things were a little bit beyond the pale.\n\nAnd so, when you had people like Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, and Bob Dole, saying at their Republican nominating conventions, \"If you are a racist, the exits are right there, we have no room for you in our party.\" I mean, come on. Like, we have their tapes, we know they're racist, we know what they were saying. We know this was not a thing that struck them as a deep moral imperative. There was a consensus, including in the Republican Party, that you had to disavow that kind of race-based fascism in order to win. And once Trump breaks that taboo, we're now at year zero in a new era where that is back on the table. And once that's on the table, once it is possible that you will have a rejuvenation of the kind of governance that happened, for example, in the American South for those many decades, the job is to eliminate that.\n\nAnd your point about, versions of him are popping up all over? Yeah, cancer is metastatic, that's why you've got to stop it. But the central fight - I mean, I actually think the central fight is the war in Europe and Putin's invasion - but, like, the number two fight, in terms of where the world's going, in terms of \"the demon-haunted world\" versus a rule of law world is, can we keep Trump out of the White House in '24?\n\nRG: And last question for you - and I know a lot of people who are listening to this who are practitioners of politics will be curious - how are you thinking about 2024 Democratic primaries? And I've written about this before but, you know, Mainstream Democrats, the group that you've mentioned, plus Democratic Majority for Israel, which works very closely with Mainstream Democrats, really transformed what was possible for progressive left-wing candidates in democratic primaries in the last cycle.\n\nI'm curious if you think you have essentially tamed the left to the point where you're kind of moving on from Democratic primaries? Or are you guys gearing up for another test in 2024, that if you see progressive candidates that you think are too progressive popping up, that the super PACs are going to come out guns blazing on them?\n\nDM: I think we're OK now. For example, when No Labels did their big launch, I think No Labels is a real threat to elect Trump again. You know, the No Labels effort?\n\nRG: For people who aren't familiar, this is the centrist group - corporate-backed that is - getting a ballot line on all, what, 50 states? Threatening to run, like, a Manchin-type, or a Manchin candidate, against both parties.\n\nDM: Yeah. It's worth unpacking just a little bit. All of that is right. The No Labels group was founded a while ago, before the current era, as, essentially, look, there's this cloakroom consensus that exists between legislators of both sides, that there's certain things that we just need to get done, and a lot of political posturing prevents us from doing it, and we need to just do it. And you know, a lot of it was fiscal, a lot of it was regulatory, whatever. That was the idea.\n\nBut this group of people, it's led by Mark Penn. Who, as you may know, is the pollster and political advisor who famously lost the 2008 primary to Barack Obama, and then who got sufficiently angry about being correctly blamed for that, that he became anti-Democrat. And then, Nancy Jacobson, who's the prolific fundraiser, who has a bunch of-\n\nRG: His wife.\n\nDM: Yeah. His wife. And she has raised a bunch of money from New York Democrats. And they live in an environment where it's easy to attack President Biden from the center-right. So, \"Oh, do you see what he did on inflation?\" And, \"Oh, do you see who he appointed to this position? And oh my gosh, Lina Khan is so bad, and all these people are so bad.\" And so, they get themselves worked up to this place where Biden's really bad, Trump's really bad, and then they do these polls that, like, out of a million people, who would you want to be president? It turns out neither Trump nor Biden comes to the top. And they're like, oh, that means we can successfully run a third party that could win.\n\nAnd people like Larry Hogan, and Joe Manchin, and so forth, you know, they like to think that they could be president someday. And so, they have this dance with donors and everybody, where they create this fiction that someone else can win.\n\nAnd Bill Galston is a Brookings Institute scholar, who was one of the founders of No Labels, and he actually just published a piece in The Wall Street Journal doubling down on this point that I'm making, which is that, if you run a No Labels centrist, like a Joe Manchin, as an independent ballot line in every state, you will split the anti-Trump coalition, and therefore Trump will win. That's the risk. And I think it's a huge risk. It is one of the top five ways that Trump could get reelected, is if Nancy Jacobson and Mark Penn and Joe Lieberman continue in this path, and put this ballot line in every state.\n\nWhen they launched this effort - this absurd, venal, effort - one of the things that they did in their video promotion is they talked about how bad the two parties were. And the visual images they included were Donald Trump on the right and AOC on the left. And so, they're ignoring the existence of Biden. Now, I don't think it works. I actually think No Labels has a real risk of collapsing in this effort, and I hope that they do. And I think that, in general, if you listen to the way Bernie Sanders is talking about endorsing Joe Biden, I am quite confident right now that the actual extremes of the left are pretty severely marginalized. That's in general.\n\nAt the margins it's a little bit like, for example, when a judge gave a ruling that was really unhelpful; this is the judge with the abortion pill. And AOC comes out and says, we should just ignore the ruling. Like, AOC is siding with JD Vance. The two of them are both like, \"Yeah, rulings that we don't like, we shouldn't do it.\" And it makes it hard to build a coalition of donors around the rule of law. But in terms of general voters, I don't think it's a problem anymore, and I don't think we need to do more to fight back against it, at the moment.\n\nRG: Well, good news and bad news for the left. They won't be bombed by super PACs, but that's because they've been thoroughly beaten down into the ground.\n\nDM: Yes.\n\nRG: There you go, congratulations.\n\nThank you for joining me.

      "text": "How Ruben Gallego Defeated Election Denier Kari Lake in Arizona's Senate Race\n\nMother Jones illustration; Evan Vucci/AP; Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nIn the race for Arizona's open US Senate seat, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has defeated the state's most vociferous election-denier, Republican Kari Lake. His win gives Democrats 47 Senate seats to the Republicans' 53.\n\nGallego's win should not come as a shock if you've been paying attention. He had led Lake in polls consistently for the last year, usually running well ahead of the Democratic presidential ticket over the same period. But Democrats' fourth consecutive Senate victory in a row in Arizona wasn't exactly preordained either. Gallego's victory statewide, after 10 years representing the state's safest blue congressional district, was a testament to his own ability to adapt to Arizona's purple electorate-and the far-right conspiracy theorist's insistence on digging in her MAGA-red heels.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema opting not to run for reelection as an Independent in the general election also helped clear the way for Gallego to build a winning coalition. Of roughly 4.4 million registered voters in Arizona, a little more than a third are Republicans; a third are not affiliated with either party; and a slightly smaller cohort, about 30 percent, are Democrats.\n\nGallego consolidated his base at the outset by running as the anti-Sinema-a Democrat who wouldn't abandon the party's economic agenda or cozy up to millionaires at Davos. As he laid the groundwork for a Senate campaign, Gallego emphasized his progressive record in the House, where he was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus for many years.\n\nHis 2024 Senate campaign didn't abandon Democrats' meat-and-potatoes issues. Gallego was still decisively in favor of abortion rights, LGBTQ issues, passing voting rights legislation, and acknowledging climate change. But to beat Lake in the general election, in a state that has voted for the GOP candidate in the last five of six presidential elections, much of Gallego's messaging had to evolve. So did the feelings of a small but impactful cohort of moderate and conservative Arizona voters.\n\nWhile Lake became a devotee and instigator of the Big Lie-falsely claiming she won her gubernatorial race in 2022 and that Trump won his race in 2020-Gallego was especially proactive in trying to thwart election denialism.\n\nA Marine veteran who saw combat in Iraq, Gallego became one of the heroes of the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. As his colleagues were panicking about the rioters seeking entry to the House floor, Gallego showed them how to use gas masks. As we reported in the May+June issue of Mother Jones , he also handed Rep. Eric Swalwell a pen to use for self-defense, should the California Democrat be attacked. This imagery undoubtedly inspired Democrats, but Republicans largely wanted to forget the day's events ever happened.\n\nThough Democrats lost the support of some Hispanic voters in other states, Gallego's support hovered closer to what the party has won in recent elections, and he ran particularly strong among men. He met those voters where they were; earlier in the campaign, he even rented out a boxing gym to hold a watch party for a big boxing match. And his campaign embraced Gallego's potential to become the first Latino senator from a state with one of the largest Latino populations in the United States, kicking off the final weekend of the race with a Mexican rodeo, where volunteers handed out Lotería cards featuring Gallego as \"El Senador\" and Lake as \"La Mentirosa,\" or liar . It reminded him, he said, of the rodeos he'd gone to growing up, when visiting his father's family in Chihuahua. But his appeal was about far more than his identity. It was rooted in aspirational working-class politics that could reach even the sorts of voters who have recently drifted to Trump.\n\n\"We're sending people to Washington, DC, that don't understand how hard it is to work,\" he said at that rodeo. \"They don't understand what it means to put 40 hours away. They don't understand what it means to actually struggle and still believe the next day it's going to be better.\"\n\nGallego was comfortable talking about border security, too. Far from the open-border policies Lake accused Gallego of promoting, he often advocated for more border patrol agents and physical structures in high-impact regions, and he highlighted how Republican senators blocked a $20 billion border security package earlier this year, at Trump's behest.\n\nThere's a common refrain in politics that losing candidates tend to fight the last war. Lake turned that line into performance art.\n\nAs the child of two immigrants, Gallego emphasized the need to reform the process of migrants coming to the US legally. Migrants are \"doing all these illegal or abusive things because they want to get here and we're not making it easier,\" he told Mother Jone s over the summer, \"and we do need people to come work.\"\n\nBut the race was as much about Gallego's ability to adapt his messaging to a broader audience as it was Lake's complete inability to do the same. For the former local TV news anchor, election denial was both a ticket to stardom and a trap. Lake resigned from her job at Fox 10 Phoenix not long after publicly questioning Fox News' decision to call the state for President Joe Biden four years ago, and she rocketed to stardom on the far-right as one of the most vocal proponents of the stolen-election narrative in a state with no shortage of them. Her insistence that Trump actually won the state, and her promise to prosecute election administrators-including Democratic secretary of state Katie Hobbs-earned her Trump's endorsement during her 2022 run for governor. For a time, people were even talking about her as a future running mate.\n\nIn 2022, Lake's election denial, and her attacks on the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, may have cost her a race in which a significant number of Republicans cast their votes, instead, for Hobbs. But Lake didn't see it that way. In fact, she wouldn't even admit that she lost. It wasn't just that Lake was being a sore loser-she went to court to challenge the results, and to argue that she should be installed in the governor's mansion. She wrote in her memoir-last year-that she was the \"lawful governor\" of Arizona and traveled the state whipping crowds into a frenzy about the race that had been stolen from her. Her attempts to overturn that election did not wind down when she began to campaign in earnest for a different office. They are still ongoing. There's a common refrain in politics that losing candidates tend to fight the last war. Lake turned that line into performance art.\n\nIf Gallego's message was a reminder to Democrats of how they win in Arizona, Lake's offered a sampler of the myriad ways in which MAGA candidates have found to lose. She spent a bizarre amount of time out-of-state, mostly at Mar-a-Lago. Earlier this year, Lake forced the state Republican party chairman to resign after secretly recording a conversation in which he suggested she sit out the Senate race. She went back and forth and back again on the state's territorial abortion ban, which-before it was repealed- outlawed all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nLake, who is being sued by Maricopa County's Republican recorder for defamation for her assertions that he helped rig the vote against her, had a tendency to clam up when she was asked about her election denial during the campaign. \"Why are we looking backward?\" she asked CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"I'm looking forward.\"\n\nBut she couldn't resist one last glimpse over her shoulder. On election eve, at a rally on the courthouse steps in Prescott, a heavily Republican enclave two hours north of Phoenix, Lake was joined by a who's who of election deniers, including Wendy Rogers, who previously called for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to be thrown in prison, and Abe Hamadeh, who continued to contest his 280-vote loss in the 2022 attorney general's race even as he ran for Congress. When it was her turn, she thanked Hamadeh for challenging the results. \"When they did to us what they did to us in 2022 and everyone else ran and hid,\" she complained. \"Guess who stood with me and said, 'Damn it, we're going to fight'?\"\n\n\"We have elections that are run so horribly,\" Lake complained. She wanted the crowd gathered in the chilly November night to \"give the people running our elections whiplash\" by making the result \"too big to rig.\"\n\nCampaign season didn't end for Lake on election day, though. On Thursday, she got one last piece of bad news: The state supreme court rejected Lake's final appeal in her attempts to overturn her 2022 defeat. Her Senate dreams are over. Her campaign for governor finally is too.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Just Signed an Order Gutting Seven More Federal Agencies\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Justice Department on Friday. Pool/AP\n\nIn an executive order signed late Friday, Donald Trump effectively dismantled seven more federal agencies, this time with cuts that will impact work on homelessness, libraries, support for minority-owned businesses, and the US Agency for Global Media, which funds Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. The cuts are expected to leave thousands more federal workers unemployed; in the case of VOA, it furthers a specific vendetta Trump has had since his first term.\n\nThe order will affect the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the United States Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and the Minority Business Development Agency. It instructs the head of each agency to submit a report to the Office of Management and Budget \"explaining which components or functions of the governmental entity, if any, are statutorily required and to what extent.\" In practice, as has happened with other federal agencies in recent weeks, it's expected to leave these agencies a shell of themselves and fundamentally nonexistent; in the case of the US Interagency Council on Homelessness, it destroys the only federal agency solely focused on addressing the homelessness crisis.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump called VOA's reporting \"disgraceful.\" This time around, he placed Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Kari Lake as a \"special advisor\" to the agency.\n\nThe move against the US Agency for Global Media has attracted the most attention, and could have the largest implications abroad. VOA specifically has been active since the 1940s, where it broadcast stories into Germany that were meant to counter Nazi propaganda. During his first term, Trump called VOA's reporting \"disgraceful .\" This time around, he placed Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Kari Lake as a \"special advisor\" to the agency. In December, he wrote that she would \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\"\n\nLake made it immediately clear that she wouldn't respect VOA's editorial independence, telling a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference, \"VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible, and sometimes it's been pitiful. We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon.\"\n\nVOA made other efforts to appease Trump, including placing leading journalist Steve Herman on leave for supposedly anti-Trump comments . Under Lake, the organization also canceled millions of dollars in contracts with other news agencies, including the Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.\n\nSome of the seven agencies that were just gutted could challenge the order in court; the US Agency for Global Media, for instance, was founded by a congressional charter and could argue that it can't be dismantled by an executive order. The authority of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to make the staggering cuts they've already made to government agencies is also being challenged in numerous lawsuits .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Ruben Gallego's Battle Against Kari Lake Could Decide the Fate of the Senate-And Our Democracy\n\nAlicia Tatone; Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty; Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nAbby Vesoulis May+June 2024 Issue\n\nn the afternoon of January 6, 2021, as election deniers armed with Tasers and tomahawks overran the US Capitol, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) handed his colleague and close friend Eric Swalwell a pen. \"Here,\" he said to the California Democrat. \"Stick this in their neck if they get close to you.\"\n\nThe Marine veteran, who'd seen combat in Iraq, leaped on a table and began issuing instructions to other panicked lawmakers, showing them how to don the gas masks secured under their chairs: \"Tear gas will not kill you. But it's important to remain calm. If you hyperventilate, you may pass out.\" If necessary, Gallego told himself, he could use his own pen as a weapon to take a more lethal one from a rioter.\n\nThree years later, the battle for American democracy continues, and Gallego, locked in one of the most pivotal contests of the 2024 election, is again attempting to hold the line. Along with close matchups in Ohio and Montana, his Senate race in Arizona for the seat Kyrsten Sinema is vacating could be one of a handful that decide control of the upper chamber and, with it, the future of our republic. Donald Trump, facing 88 criminal counts , has promised to usher in MAGA on steroids if reelected, including mass deportation and sweeping bans on gender-affirming care. A Democratic-­led Senate would be one of the last fortifications against his agenda.\n\nAs if to further underscore the stakes, Gallego's opponent is the former TV news anchor turned Trump sycophant Kari Lake. A prolific purveyor of conspiracy theories, Lake claims not only that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump but also that she was robbed of the Arizona governorship in her 2022 race. If Trumpism is akin to a religion, Lake views herself as one of its martyrs . \"You can call us extremists. You can call us domestic terrorists,\" she declared during one campaign event in 2022. \"You know who else was called a lot of names his whole life? Jesus.\"\n\nLake's loss two years ago is just one indicator that Arizona is turning away from Trump-style conservatism. Though Trump won the state by 3.6 percent in 2016, he lost it in 2020 by about half of a percent. In 2022, all of the major statewide candidates Trump endorsed were defeated. But the state is certainly not a Democratic stronghold, either. Of roughly 4.1 million registered voters , there are some 236,000 more Republicans and 197,000 more independents than there are Democrats. To win, Gallego \"has to appeal to a cross ­section of voters,\" says former Arizona Democratic Party Chair Jim Pederson, \"particularly moderate Republicans.\"\n\nDoing so will require Gallego to walk a nuanced line on the border crisis; the crisis raises drug and crime concerns for many Republican voters, but migrants also fuel the state's economy. The high-profile race will also force Gallego to confront controversies from his past. The same wartime experiences that prepared him for January 6­ left him with PTSD that has led to angry outbursts and the collapse of his first marriage while his then-wife was pregnant with their child.\n\nGallego's mental health struggles may be good fodder for his opponent to leverage against him, but his allies counter that his history of hardships is not a liability-it may even be an asset.\n\n\"I was on the floor with him on January 6. I was sitting right next to him,\" Swalwell says. \"And I saw, actually, not somebody with a temper, but somebody very much in control.\"\n\nGallego never had it easy. Both of his parents immigrated to the United States as teens, his father from Mexico and his mom from Colombia. His parents divorced around the time Gallego was in junior high. His now-estranged dad, who worked in construction, would eventually be convicted on felony drug charges. His mom raised Gallego and his three sisters in a small apartment outside of Chicago, where Gallego slept on the living room floor and helped the family make ends meet through odd jobs as a line cook, a janitor, and a cashier. From his makeshift bedroom, he plotted an escape route out of poverty by way of a college education. His dream school, Harvard, ultimately offered him a scholarship.\n\nIn Cambridge, Gallego had a dorm room with a bed-something he hadn't had in six years. He majored in international relations, thinking he might work for the State Department one day, and experienced some culture shock. \"We both were finding our way in this new environment,\" says Shailesh Sahay, Gallego's fraternity brother and future best man, who is also the son of immigrants. \"We both went to public high schools and kind of socialized in a normal public school way. To contrast that, there were kids like Jared Kushner in school with us. His budget for going out on Saturday night was significantly higher than our budget was.\"\n\nBut Gallego could hobnob with anyone, friends say. \"Was he absolutely the coolest kid in class? No, but he definitely knew a lot of people,\" says Jean-Pierre Jacquet, another Harvard classmate and fraternity brother in Sigma Chi. He \"had a lot of self-confidence, which is, you know, not unusual in Cambridge.\"\n\nDuring his sophomore year Gallego's college career was nearly derailed after his grades declined and he broke some campus rules. (\"Underage drinking\" was involved, he told the Boston Globe .) Harvard administrators kicked him out of school, saying he could reapply in a year. A few months later, Gallego enlisted as a Marine reservist and completed basic training in South Carolina. He was readmitted to Harvard for the winter 2001 semester.\n\nThat fall, Gallego watched on a laptop screen as two hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center towers, changing the country's future-and his.\n\nIn 2003, during what would have been Gallego's final semester at Harvard, his unit was sent to Okinawa, Japan, for an uneventful deployment. But the next one wouldn't be. After graduating from Harvard in 2004, Gallego followed his college girlfriend, Kate Widland, to New Mexico. He did fieldwork for John Kerry's presidential bid until he was called up again, this time to Iraq with a battalion that would send home 48 flag-draped caskets, more than any other since 1983's Beirut bombing.\n\nAfter six bloody months in Iraq, Gallego settled in Phoenix, where Kate had moved to work in Democratic politics. \"Coming back to 'normal' life was disorienting. The goals were nebulous, the relationships far less intense, and therefore less meaningful,\" he writes in his 2021 memoir, They Called Us \"Lucky.\"\n\nNot long after his homecoming, Gallego landed a job at a public relations firm, and work became a soothing distraction. \"I was immediately impressed, especially when I heard his story,\" says Joe Yuhas, the firm's managing partner who remembers meeting Gallego while in line for the bar at a charity event. \"He's energetic and tenacious and he listens. Those were important features in the work that we did.\"\n\nOne of Gallego's first projects was battling a state ballot proposition banning gay marriage. During this campaign, Gallego clashed with one of the local politicians leading it, then-state Rep. Sinema.\n\nGallego's role included recruiting volunteers, many of them members of the same LGBTQ community as Sinema, who is bisexual. Even so, she considered it a mistake to place queer people at the center of the campaign-she wanted to focus on how the proposition would also make it more difficult for straight and unmarried­ ­couples to access insurance and legal protections. After Gallego argued she was alienating their most effective advocates, Sinema eventually requested his removal from the campaign. Yuhas chalks it up to a \"personality conflict,\" adding that \"neither one of them lacks in personality.\"\n\nSinema's strategy was necessary-they won by a 4-point margin-given the state's conservative politics at the time, Yuhas says. And he notes that Gallego thrived working on other projects, including the successful campaign of Phoenix City Council Member Michael Nowakowski, who poached Gallego as his chief of staff.\n\nNowakowski and Gallego had an odd-couple relationship-Nowakowski a soft-spoken manager of a Spanish-­language radio station who once dreamed of becoming a priest, and Gallego a hard-charging war veteran. \"I want to throw down some hail and brimstone, and this guy's like, 'It's not how I operate,'\" Gallego told the Arizona Republic in 2008.\n\nGallego's fiery temperament caused a local scandal the following year when he sharply upbraided a council intern, \"yelling and pounding his desk,\" according to the Republic . Less than an hour after the incident, Gallego emailed two city council staffers: \"When you have a chance I would like to talk to you about [the aide],\" he wrote. \"Her time as an intern is up.\"\n\nThe intern claimed Gallego \"was aggressive towards me\" and filed two complaints with the city. She was let go shortly after. The city ultimately cleared Gallego of the harassment accusations and noted that the intern was previously slated to be dismissed due to budget cuts. Gallego touches on the episode in his memoir, attributing his behavior to trauma from his military service. \"I'd never lost my cool before the war,\" he writes. \"Now I did, snapping and yelling at people for little reason.\"\n\nGallego resigned from Nowakowski's office in late 2009 to run for a state House seat representing a liberal portion of Phoenix. In this new role, he prioritized legislation that benefited fellow military service members, specifically a bipartisan bill granting veterans in-state tuition in Arizona. But soon he was looking for his next break, and after the US House member who represented his district announced his retirement, Gallego jumped into the race. After a competitive primary, Gallego handily won the general election.\n\nGallego's demons persisted as he climbed the political ladder in DC. \"I still drank more than I should. Smoked more than I should. Lost my temper more than I should,\" he writes in his book. \"I had nightmares. I thought about my dead friends. I wondered why I was alive. I couldn't seem to find anything to cheer me up.\"\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs lists many of these symptoms in its criteria for PTSD, a diagnosis Gallego received after three years of medical evaluations. Yet by then, his relationship with Kate, whom he married in 2010, had unraveled; they announced their separation in 2016 when she was in the third trimester of her pregnancy with their son. Now the mayor of Phoenix, she and Gallego co-parent their 7-year-old, who often joins his dad on the campaign trail. Kate also endorsed her ex-husband's Senate bid in December, though Gallego's critics have seized on the timing of their split. (Kate Gallego declined an interview with Mother Jones .) The Washington Free Beacon has filed a motion to unseal ­Gallego's­ divorce records, and Lake has attacked him over the issue. Referring to Gallego's pro-choice views, she said she would \"not be lectured on motherhood\" by someone who \"left his wife when she was nine months pregnant.\"\n\nGallego's mental health struggles have also bled into his congressional life. A former Arizona state lawmaker describes a meeting, not long after Gallego first came to Capitol Hill, in which a veteran who had been injured by an IED lobbied Gallego to oppose the Iran nuclear deal. \"When this guy came in and told Ruben, 'If you don't vote against the bill, you're gonna have the blood of American servicemen and women on your hands,' [Gallego] blew up and he started screaming,\" the former lawmaker, who was present, recalls. (A congressional aide who was also in the room disputes that Gallego yelled.) \"He took a stern tone,\" says the aide, who adds Gallego's frustration was in response to \"how aggressive and confrontational the veteran was.\"\n\nGallego's sometimes-salty disposition, the former lawmaker points out, might contrast sharply with the camera-ready persona of his opponent, especially if they square off in a debate. \"Lake has had 30 years of television experience and can be very poised,\" the former lawmaker says. \"And he could come off as an angry short man yelling at the woman who might be saying outrageous and insane things but is looking composed.\"\n\nWith Lake, political disinformation and deceit are masked by a perfect pixie cut and gleaming white smile. With Gallego, his allies say, what you see is what you get. \"Sometimes I'm out with him, and he'll meet somebody new. And I expect politician Ruben to come out. And it doesn't,\" says Swalwell. \"I've seen people tell him they're in Washington working on whatever issue. And he'll say, 'Well, that's a bad idea.' He's not afraid to tell people how he feels-not in a rude way. But if you're expecting a polished politician, that's not Ruben, and that's refreshing.\"\n\nIn mid-December , Gallego's forthright nature is on display during a visit to Yuma County to judge Somerton's 16th annual Tamale Festival.\n\n\"Good spice,\" he writes on a blue scorecard next to a four-star entry.\n\nEntry number 24 is \"too dry,\" but the tamale from contestant 25 is \"amazing.\"\n\n\"I don't know about this, y'all,\" Gallego says as he bites into a spinach one. \"No, no, no, no.\" He shakes his head as he pushes the green mush to the side of his plate.\n\nHe jokes that after sampling two dozen contenders, he may have to cross the border to sample something else: Ozempic.\n\nAs we walk by various food vendors, Gallego is approached by at least a dozen festival attendees, including a squad of young cheerleaders seeking a group picture and a woman from the Cocopah Indian Tribe, who has Gallego's ear on and off throughout the day. \"You'll never see Sinema or Kari Lake doing any of this, like talking to people, trying to actually understand what's going on with their lives,\" he says.\n\nIn addition to festivals, parades, and rallies-the meat-and-potatoes campaign schedule for any conventional candidate-Gallego is also on a mission to visit all 22 federally recognized Native tribes in Arizona. Part of this is personal. Gallego says two of his closest friends are Navajo brothers with whom he served in Iraq. And one of the few bills he's successfully navigated to passage in the House provides resources to Native tribes to help them prevent and investigate child abuse. Gallego's strategy is also politically astute. The massive turnout of Native people, who make up roughly 5 percent of the state population, proved critical for Democrats in 2020, when Biden won the state by fewer than 12,000 votes.\n\nWhile Lake already boasts national name recognition, experts say Gallego's go-everywhere-talk-to-everyone approach is critical to broadening his appeal outside of Phoenix. \"If the Republicans or Democrats were winning by a huge landslide, then maybe it's not necessarily going to make much of a difference to try to engage with all these low-population counties,\" says Samara Klar, a political science professor at the University of Arizona and an expert on independent voters. \"But that's not the way in Arizona. We have extremely razor-thin margins of victory.\"\n\nThe thin margins have something to do with the unique politics of Arizona, where a third of registered voters claim no political party. One of the state's most revered politicians was the late John McCain, the Republican elder statesman of the Senate known as a partisanship-bucking maverick. A year before his death, McCain famously gave a forceful thumbs-down as he cast the deciding vote against a GOP-led attempt to repeal part of the Affordable Care Act. Sinema, who was elected to the Senate shortly after McCain's death, also rejected a pivotal measure with the same hand gesture. In her case, she was one of a handful of Democrats blocking an increase of the federal minimum wage.\n\nSinema's obstructionism, especially her refusal in 2022 to support reforming the filibuster to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act by a simple majority, convinced Gallego to run for her seat. \"The filibuster isn't a tool to encourage sophisticated debate, it's a tool to kill legislation that the vast majority of Americans support,\" Gallego said at the time . Later that year, Sinema became an independent and filed initial paperwork to run for reelection as such. Gallego's announcement that he would challenge Sinema from the left both elated and alarmed liberals who worried they would divide the moderate-to-liberal vote and tip the scales toward a Lake victory-and perhaps a GOP-led Senate.\n\nSinema's March announcement that she would instead retire at the end of her term relieved Democrats, taking a messy three-way race off the table. Arizona Democrats won big in 2022, electing a Democratic governor, secretary of state, and attorney general. But if the results suggest a repudiation of Trumpism, mounting concerns over immigration could hamper Gallego's chances. An October survey of registered Arizona voters, for example, found they trusted Trump more than Biden on immigration by a margin of 54 to 41 percent.\n\nThe issue is personal to Gallego. His parents immigrated through family reunification and worker visas, he says. He supports increasing funding for both humanitarian aid and Border Patrol personnel. But he also argues that today's crisis stems largely from the dismantling of the pathways his parents took to enter the country legally.\n\nIt's not simply that migrants need us, he argues, but that we need them. Just 12 miles from Somerton is the Mexican border, which tens of thousands of migrants cross during peak season to work the Yuma County fields that produce about 90 percent of the country's lettuce every winter. Throngs more opt for less safe and less legal-but more permanent-solutions.\n\nThey are \"doing all these illegal or abusive things because they want to get here and we're not making it easier,\" he says, \"and we do need people to come work.\"\n\nTwo months after the tamale festival, I catch up with Gallego on Capitol Hill. While he waits to vote on some procedural measures, we take brisk laps between the entrance to the House chamber and Statuary Hall. These days, this is how Gallego gets in his steps, as he juggles legislative and child-rearing duties. Last summer, Gallego and his second wife, Sydney, a Democratic lobbyist whom he met at the 2018 annual congressional baseball game, welcomed a baby girl. A member of the Congressional Dads Caucus, Gallego took a few weeks of parental leave over the summer.\n\nOn our walk, we talk about television shows (he is hooked on Netflix's Griselda ), Mexican food (don't make him pick a favorite dish), and which chores he contributes to his household. (\"The real answer is I don't do enough,\" he admits.)\n\nWe also discuss the day's legislative agenda-namely, what wasn't on it. Earlier that week, Democrats and Republicans seemed close to consensus on a border bill. The deal, initially backed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, would have barred migrants with criminal histories from applying for asylum, quickened hearing timelines, and more. Then Trump weighed in. \"Only a fool, or a Radical Left Democrat, would vote for this horrendous Border Bill,\" he posted to Truth Social. \"Don't be STUPID!!!\"\n\nThat was that. The bill was dead.\n\nRepublicans \"really had nothing else to run on, and it was going to be taken away, and that's when Donald Trump and his minions called it in and sunk it,\" says Gallego. \"It was one of the most cynical political moves I've seen since I've been in Washington, DC.\"\n\nThere is some competition for that distinction of course-notably Trump's effort to overturn the election, which culminated in the insurrection that sent Gallego into combat mode three years earlier not far from where we stand. That Gallego is now facing Lake, one of the biggest promoters of the Big Lie, in this pivotal Senate race is oddly fitting, and its outcome will say much about where the nation may be headed.\n\nOne candidate amplified the election lies that motivated thousands of Trump zealots to ransack the citadel of American democracy. The other prepared to repel this onslaught-and preserve the sanctity of the democratic process-with a ballpoint pen. In November, democracy is again on the line. And Gallego is up for the fight.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Matt Rourke/AP\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican National Convention will hear from Kari Lake, the party's 2022 nominee for governor of Arizona who is now the frontrunner in the state's Republican primary for US Senate. Lake is one of the MAGA movement's biggest stars, and she is running in one of the year's most high-profile races. If she can make it out of the primary on July 30, she'll face D emocratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in a contest that will help determine which party controls the Senate.\n\nBut Kari Lake is not just a Republican candidate for US Senate. She also claims to be the \"lawful\" governor of Arizona-and she's still contesting that loss in court, 20 months after she officially lost to now-Gov. Katie Hobbs. In an appeal filed last week to the Arizona Supreme Court, Lake asked the justices to either install her in the governor's mansion or order a do-over election, alleging that Maricopa County improperly verified signatures on hundreds of thousands of ballots. In other words, Lake is trying simultaneously to become Arizona's senator and its governor. All of which raises an admittedly strange question: What happens if Lake wins her lawsuit?\n\nLet's say a judge declared Lake the actual governor. Would she continue running for Senate, or would she drop out to serve out the rest of the term as governor? (And, because Arizona has no lieutenant governor, if Lake didn't finish her term, wouldn't that mean turning over the newly acquired governor's office to the Democratic secretary of state Adrian Fontes, who is one of the people that Republicans have accused of having helped steal the 2020 election?) Or what if the judge ordered a do-over election-would Lake drop out of the Senate race to run in it?\n\nAs far as I can tell, Lake hasn't addressed what she would do if she gets the outcome she is purportedly pushing for. I reached out to her campaign twice and haven't heard back.\n\nIt is an unusual questions. Prior to this year, I can't recall a previous race where this has come up. But in 2024 year, there are actually two such campaigns-Abe Hamadeh, the 2022 Republican nominee for Arizona attorney general, is also seeking a do-over election of that race, while seeking election to Congress.\n\nChaotic hypotheticals aside, there is a simple explanation for all of this. This is not a serious lawsuit. In fact, Lake's case is so bad that she already lost a version of it in the state's district court, appeals court, and supreme court. One of the attorneys who handled her last appeal is currently serving a two-month suspension from the state bar for making false claims in legal filings in that case. Lake is not trying to win-she is appealing her loss because she is stuck. So much of her public identity was built on never accepting Trump's defeat that Lake can now never accept her own.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Katie Hobbs Defeats MAGA Star Kari Lake in Arizona\n\nMother Jones illustration; Kevin Dietsch/Getty; Alberto Mariani/ZUMA\n\nIn the final days before the midterm election, Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor of Arizona, filmed an unusual series of ads . They weren't about high gas prices in the state, or public schools, or crime. They weren't even about the Arizona governor's race at all. Speaking directly to the camera, Lake addressed Republican voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania, and asked them to elect Tudor Dixon and Doug Mastriano-election-deniers running for governor in their respective states.\n\nIn a year in which Republicans expected big things, the ads are an artifact of a wave that never really came. Mastriano and Dixon lost their races handily. And on Monday, Lake finally lost too, in a close race against the current secretary of state, Democrat Katie Hobbs. Lake had presented an image of confidence in not just a win, but a big win, insisting that late-counted mail ballots would break heavily her way. But it wasn't enough. Democrats will now hold a share of power in Arizona for the first time since 2009, when then-Gov. Janet Napolitano resigned to serve as Barack Obama's secretary of homeland security. They gain a crucial check on the legislature in a state that's been an incubator for right-wing politics. It was one final blow to the Republican party's coup caucus, in an election that in many ways turned into a referendum on them.\n\nA former local news anchor, Lake questioned Fox News' decision in 2020 to call the state for Joe Biden relatively early on election night-days before most other news outlets did. She quit the profession a few months later. Her candidacy, particularly during the primary, aggressively channeled anger among conservatives clinging to false allegations of mass election fraud and malfeasance. She demanded an audit of the 2020 results and said that Arizona's election should be formally decertified. \"You have to be smoking Hunter Biden's crack pipe\" to think Biden won the state, Lake said last year. For months, she promised that the very first thing she'd do when she took office was begin a formal investigation into what really happened. She held an event at a roadside rodeo with Mike Lindell. She called for Hobbs, who had overseen the 2020 election, to be jailed.\n\nAs I explained in a recent profile ,  Lake's campaign was powered by her career in local TV news. She very deliberately positioned herself as not just a rising star, but as a political exile from a \"corrupt\" industry, who was using the trust the industry had bequeathed her to tear down her former colleagues. She hammered home the sort of themes that tend to dominate local TV news:\n\nWin or lose, Lake is the embodiment of both the style and substance of the politics that's powering conservatism at this moment-screen-tested showmanship with A-block sensibilities: perps on the streets, pervs in the schools, and pain at the pump. In 2010, anger at health care reform, Wall Street bailouts, and a Black president powered a Republican landslide that set the terms for the decade ahead. But in 2022, Trumpism turned maximally inward. Joe Biden is largely absent from this year's narrative. On the campaign trail, his infrastructure and climate laws are rarely mentioned. Instead, conservative campaigns have been powered by panics, real and imagined.\n\nHobbs-the person Lake wanted to jail-could hardly have been more different. Elected in 2018 by a margin of just a few thousand votes, she was an understated presence who was criticized by some Democrats for not being visible enough in the campaign's final weeks. She ran on her work in safeguarding the democratic process in 2020; on protecting reproductive rights in the state (where an 1864 law could ban all abortions except to save the life of the mother, if the state supreme court upholds it); and as a fairly moderate presence that you could trust to not be Kari Lake. These things evidently mattered more in 2022 than crowd sizes, just as they did in 2020.\n\nArizona, Lake would tell the crowd in a pre-recorded video that played at the start of every event, was a \"red state.\" It represented a key distinction between the two parties and their approach to this election. Despite their recent successes there, Democrats had no such arrogance about what it takes to win. Hobbs needed all of her party to show up. She needed the support of Mexican Americans, Native voters, college students, and unions. She needed the work of groups like LUCHA, which got out the vote for much of the Democratic slate while also pushing a ballot initiative to give in-state college tuition to non-citizens. (The referendum appears to be on track to do slightly better than Hobbs herself.) But to clear the final hurdle, the Democrat was also counting on the sorts of independent voters and non-MAGA Republicans who had helped elect Biden and Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly-along with the current Republican governor and a certain POW-turned-Republican-senator before that.\n\nLake, on the other hand, was so confident about her state's true politics, so steadfast in her belief that Democrats' 2020 breakthrough wasn't legitimate, that she made an unusual request to voters at a campaign event last December.\n\n\"We don't have any McCain Republicans in here, do we?\" she asked . There was a loud of chorus of boos. \"Alright, get the hell out!\"\n\nOn election day, they did.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Election Deniers Just Scored a Major Win in Arizona's Biggest County\n\nMother Jones; Michael Brochstein/Zuma; Unsplash\n\nEarlier this month, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican who oversees mail-in voting, voter registration, and property records in America's fourth-largest county, reached out to Elon Musk with an invitation.\n\n\"Can I please give you a tour of our election facility and mail voting process,\" he wrote on Musk's social-media platform, X, after the red-pilled billionaire declared that \"electronic voting machines\" and \"anything mailed in\" were \"too risky\" to use in elections.\n\n\"You can go into all the rooms,\" Richer continued. \"You can examine all the equipment. You can ask any question you want. We'd love to show you the security steps already in place, which I think are very sound.\"\n\nFor three-and-a-half years, Richer has been asking skeptical Republicans just to hear him out about how elections really work in the most closely contested county in the nation's most closely contested state. First elected in 2020 amid right-wing fears about George Soros, Richer, a Federalist Society lawyer, emerged as one of the nation's most outspoken voices against the myth of stolen outcomes. He held the line against election deniers such as Kari Lake (who Richer is currently suing for defamation) while attempting to make the election process as transparent as possible. Richer opened the doors to the county's Tabulation and Election Center for more than 150 tours, turned the security cameras on 24/7 for people to watch at home, and tirelessly fielded questions on Musk's platform-all while facing a stream of violent threats and criticism.\n\nBut it turned out that good cheer and transparency could only accomplish so much. Musk, for one, did not take Richer up on the offer. And on Tuesday, Richer finally ran out of time to change his fellow Republicans' minds: He lost his primary to state Rep. Justin Heap, a member of legislature's Freedom Caucus, who was backed by many of the state's most prominent election deniers. The single-digit margin only tells a part of the story; with another Richer critic running a strong third, just 36 percent of Republican voters backed the incumbent.\n\nHeap managed to never say whether he thought the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen during his campaign. But he didn't really have to. To understand what he represented and why he was running, you only had to look at the endorsements he racked up from many of the biggest names in what Richer has called Arizona's \"cottage industry\" of election denial.\n\nChief among those backers was Lake, who ran for governor in 2022 while calling for her Democratic opponent to be imprisoned for the 2020 presidential election to be \"decertified,\" and is still- still! -attempting to get a court to declare her the winner of a race she lost by 17,000 votes. Lake-who in her memoir described a lengthy dream sequence she had about being kidnapped by Richer, taken to the desert, and nearly murdered-is now the Republican nominee for US Senate.\n\nAnother prominent supporter was Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer for Turning Point Action, who was indicted in April for his role in the 2020 fake elector scheme. Heap had the support of Arizona Reps. Paul Gosar (who coordinated with \"Stop the Steal\" leaders on January 6th), and Andy Biggs (who tried to round up support for the state's fake electors in the run-up to the Electoral College certification). As the Arizona Mirror reported in April, one of the people who nudged Heap into running was his colleague in the statehouse, state Rep. Jake Hoffman-another fake elector.\n\nThe vitriol Richer faced from current party leaders was intense. Earlier this year, Shelby Busch, the vice chair of the Maricopa County Republican party told an audience that if it was up to her, she \" would lynch \" Richer. Busch, who later said that she was joking, went on to lead the state party's delegation to the Republican National Convention.\n\nBecause of the way elections are run in the county, a new recorder can't just rewrite the rules on his own terms. The Board of Supervisors is responsible for tabulation and election-day voting, for instance, and the state's vote-by-mail system and use of electronic voting machines are set by statute. But notably, Heap has voted to get rid of both of those things, while also voting to mandate hand-counts. (At the same time, Heap is running to be Recorder on the promise of speeding up the counting of votes, which a hand count is not likely to accomplish.)\n\nWith support from independents and hard-earned respect from some Democrats, Richer was in a decent position to win a second term if he managed to survive the primary. One Indivisible activist from Scottsdale, who took an election-facility tour with Richer, told me that Richer was going to be the first Republican she ever voted for. But Heap's victory is far from guaranteed in a county where Democrats have won a succession of key races by appealing to independents and moderate Republicans. On Tuesday, Democrats nominated Tim Stringham, an Army and Navy veteran who previously served as a JAG attorney.\n\nWhen we spoke in June, Stringham told me that he had entered the race reluctantly, after being nudged by the county Democratic party. But he cited Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a pivotal moment in his decision to become more involved in politics.\n\n\"And as a veteran, somebody who's gone 10,000 miles and risked being blown up to defend democracy, you start feeling a little bit silly. My wife is back in Arizona, what the hell am I doing?\"\n\n\"Watching on TV, and being like, holy cow, the President of the United States is really trying to overthrow the republic here,\" Stringham said. \"And I always tell people that it's like, you know, if there's just a riot, there's just a riot, those things happen. But somebody actually handed fake electoral votes to Mike Pence and said we want you to read these votes. They no-shit tried to overthrow the Constitution. And as a veteran, somebody who's gone 10,000 miles and risked being blown up to defend democracy, you start feeling a little bit silly.\"\n\n\"'My wife is back in Arizona, what the hell am I doing?,'\" he said, recalling his thought process at the time. \"'I'm clearly not in the right place to actually protect American democracy.'\"\n\nStringham did not believe there was a \"huge philosophical difference\" between he and Richer on how the recorder's office was run, but he was adamant about wanting to preserve the availability of ballot drop-boxes and protect vote-by-mail from Republican legislators' attempts to end it.\n\nThe incumbent's defeat is a setback for election officials who have faced threats and tried to clarify the process amid a deluge of misinformation. Scores of election workers across the country, and particularly in Arizona, are leaving their jobs in part due to the added strain of dealing with sometimes-armed conspiracy theorists and endless lawsuits. In Maricopa, Republican county supervisor Bill Gates, who joined Richer in defending the election process in 2022, chose not to run for re-election this year and has talked publicly about suffering from PTSD. Another Republican supervisor who has been a target of election deniers, Jack Sellers, lost his primary on Tuesday too. It's tough to see how things might have played out differently in recent years if the people screaming about stopping the steal also had allies in some of the most important election administration positions in the land. But it probably wouldn't have been great.\n\nRicher's loss won't, at least, have much of an effect on how the 2024 election is conducted. The recorder's term won't end until January-meaning that the lame-duck Republican will still be around to do one last job this November.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Glenn Youngkin Is Only as Moderate as the Election Denier He's Campaigning For\n\nVirginia Governor Glenn Youngkin speaks at a rally with Oregon gubernatorial candidate Christine Drazan in Aurora, Oregon. Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty\n\nIs Glenn Youngkin running for president? Paul Ryan thinks he should. A voter in Tucson told him to . The Republican governor of Virginia smiled, perhaps a little too eagerly, when an ABC News reporter asked Youngkin again on Wednesday evening after firing up a crowd of conservative voters in Scottsdale, Arizona. \"I haven't really thought about 2024; we're focused on 2022,\" he said. He was in Arizona, he continued, because \"every state deserves a Republican governor.\"\n\nBut the presence of the candidate seated a few feet away from him, in a small airplane hangar at the offices of a company that makes parts for firearms, answered the question more frankly than Youngkin is prepared to right now. Of course he's keeping his options open; why else would somebody interrupt their busy schedule to do six events in one day with Kari Lake ?\n\nYoungkin, the former president and COO of the private-equity behemoth the Carlyle Group, was elected in an upset last year by riding a wave of opposition to pandemic restrictions and a racist panic about Critical Race Theory, while keeping Donald Trump himself at arm's length. Trump endorsed Youngkin, but Youngkin never appeared with Trump. It was a flimsy sort of two-step, but for plenty of Republicans it was enough. Youngkin was a moderate, not in an actual policy sense, but in a purely aesthetic one; he represented a return to the party's bread-and-butter-a tall, rich white man whose signature accessory was not a red hat but a red vest.\n\nLake, the Republican nominee for governor of Arizona, is not trying to fool anyone into thinking she is a retro Republican; she is running instead as the next evolution of the performance-based politics of the Trump era. A former local TV news anchor at Phoenix's Fox affiliate, she questioned Fox News' decision to call the state for Joe Biden on air, quit her job not long after, and became one of Arizona's most fervent proponents of Trump's false narrative of a stolen election. She has said that \"you have to be smoking Hunter Biden's crack pipe\" to believe that Joe Biden won Arizona. She has called on the state to decertify the 2020 election. She has vowed to \"get to the bottom\" of what really happened in the \"corrupt\" election before she does anything else in office, although she also says that she her first priority will be to declare an \"invasion\" on the southern border. According to the most recent polls , which gives her a narrow lead over Democratic secretary of state Katie Hobbs-whom Lake believes should be in prison-she just might get that chance.\n\nFlying across the country to campaign with one of America's most fervent election deniers is a choice, and it was meant to be seen as one. Youngkin was very deliberately asserting that the Republican Party must come together as it is, not by cleaving off its most anti-democratic elements but by elevating them to even greater power, so that the anti-democratic elements can use their new authority in ways that are beneficial to Republicans. This is not a new direction so much as an acceptance of the current one.\n\nAt the evening rally in Scottsdale, Youngkin-who has begrudgingly said that he would have voted to certify the election and also begrudgingly said that Joe Biden is the legitimate president-did not discuss the 2020 election that had helped inspire his endorsee to get into politics, and Lake did him the kindness of largely avoiding the subject in her own remarks. They focused, instead, on the general-election politics that binds them-a demand for more (and more militant) resources at the southern border; an end to \"woke\" education; and a freedom from CDC tyranny. But you didn't have to look far to find a reminder of the small-d democratic stakes of the election, and the forces that had powered Lake's rise-as they shook hands with voters afterwards, Mark Finchem, the election-denying candidate for secretary of state, lurked just a few feet away, in his characteristic white cowboy hat.\n\nIn the scrum with reporters afterwards, Youngkin tried to elide his disagreement with Lake and Finchem over whether the current president is an imposter. Governors, he said, \"have to go to work in order to provide much more confidence in the election process,\" he said, before comparing Democratic complaints about the Florida recount and Russian election interference to Trump's invented conspiracy. \"It's not just Republicans. It's Democrats. I ran against someone who said the election was stolen in 2000. And in 2016 they said that Donald Trump wasn't legitimately elected. So this is not a Republican problem, it's an American challenge. And our job as governors is to invest in the process.\"\n\n\"This is what I've gone to work to do,\" he said. \"And I can guarantee you that Kari's going to go to work as well.\"\n\nThat's certainly one way of describing what Lake wants to do. But it was a neat rhetorical trick on Youngkin's part, to turn support for a lie that led to a violent attack on the Capitol into just another opportunity for governors to roll up their sleeves .\n\nIn Arizona, Youngkin was eager to show conservative voters that he is, above all, a loyal party man, by demonstrating as explicitly as he could that there's a place for the most fervently conspiratorial election deniers in the highest ranks of the party. But if the party isn't moderate, the Party Man isn't going to be either.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the former House Republican conference chairwoman who praised Youngkin after his election last fall, criticized him for the \"accomodation\" he was granting to the party's most anti-democratic actors.\n\n\"Republicans don't agree on everything,\" he said Wednesday, when asked about Cheney's comments. \"But I'm telling you, we agree on so much.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kari Lake Claims She Opposes Arizona's Near-Total Abortion Ban-The Same One She Cheered Two Years Ago\n\nRicardo Arduengo/Getty\n\nShortly after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a Civil War-era, near-total ban on abortion on Tuesday, Republican Senate hopeful and former gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake blasted the decision as \"out of step with Arizonans.\"\n\nShe declined, however, to explain the apparent about-face. Two years ago on the gubernatorial campaign trail, Lake eagerly praised the 1864 law, which if enforced would make nearly all abortions in the state illegal and potentially criminalize healthcare providers with up to five years in prison.\n\n\"I'm incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the books,\" Lake said on a June 2022 episode of \"The Conservative Circus with James T. Harris,\" adding that the law would enable Arizonans to \"be paving the way and setting the course for other states to follow.\"\n\nLake is a longtime supporter of Donald Trump and has repeatedly celebrated the impacts of overturning Roe v. Wade . Like Trump, she still denies her 2022 election loss to now-governor, Democrat Katie Hobbs. But amid immediate outrage over Tuesday's decision allowing the 1864 law to go into effect, Lake appeared to forget her previous support for the very same law and urged Hobbs to \"come up\" with a solution.\n\nWhen Ruben Gallego, the expected Democratic nominee for Senate in Arizona, called out Lake's previous support for the law on Tuesday, Caroline Wren, a senior adviser to Lake, claimed on X that Lake had been referring to the state's 15-week abortion ban in 2022. Yet in the original interview, Lake mentioned the 1800s-era law by name.\n\nLake joins other Republicans in the state who were quick to try and distance themselves from this week's ruling, including Rep . David Schweikert, the same congressman who said that he was \"pleased\" by the fall of Roe. Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives Ben Toma and President of the Arizona Senate Warren Petersen submitted an amicus brief in support of the 1864 law, then released a joint statement promising to listen \"to our constituents to determine the best course of action for the legislature.\"\n\nWhen asked about the Arizona law on Wednesday, Trump said that Arizona went too far. But pushed on the question of criminalizing health care providers, Trump, who despite helping overturn Roe is attempting to feign moderation in the lead-up to November, responded with classic vaguery. \"Let that be to the states.\"\n\nFollowing the state Supreme Court's ruling, it's unclear if and how the 1864 ban will be enforced. The law goes into effect in 13 days, and there's a 45-day gap following the official mandate when it's not legally enforceable. Planned Parenthood, which operates most clinics in the state, said they will continue to give care throughout that period. The state's Attorney General Kris Mayes said she will not prosecute any \"woman or doctor\" under the law.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Arizona's Election Deniers Say to Trust the Process-For Now\n\nTurning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk speaks at an Arizona campaign event. Ross D. Franklin/ AP\n\nWhen Tim Stringham arrived at a \"Veterans for Harris\" canvassing launch on Sunday in a Phoenix shopping center alongside Sen. Mark Kelly and Rep. Ted Lieu of California, the 35-year-old first-time candidate took a moment to acknowledge the obvious.\n\n\"You know that times are strange when the candidate for recorder gets to come up here and speak with a US Senator and a United States congressman,\" he told the 30 or so volunteers who had packed into the narrow room for the start of a critical afternoon of knocking on doors.\n\nStringham, a former JAG attorney, is the Democratic candidate for Maricopa County recorder, an office that's responsible for maintaining voter rolls and mailing out ballots in a county of more than 4 million people. In a normal year, it's one of those vital but mostly anonymous jobs, like assessor or auditor, that voters are only aware of-if they're aware of it at all-from yard signs. But Maricopa's elections, as Kelly pointed out a few moments later, have not been normal for quite a while. The fight for a few downballot races like Stringham's will determine the future of the democratic process in a county that in recent years has become ground zero for election denial.\n\n\"Before I talk about the presidential election, I want to talk about the county recorders race,\" the former astronaut told the canvassers in Phoenix. \"The guy we had, Steve Richer, the Republican, did a fantastic job. And nothing against Tim here...but he did a really good job, and we actually owe him a lot. He sort of, like, maybe saved democracy.\"\n\nStephen Richer, as I reported for a recent story and an episode of Reveal , drew national praise for standing up to election deniers in the aftermath of the 2020 and 2022 elections, while working to make his county's voting process more transparent. But he was vilified by members of his party, including the 2022 Republican gubernatorial nominee-and 2024 US Senate nominee-MAGA loyalist Kari Lake, who blamed him for their losses that year. In July, right-wing state representative Justin Heap defeated Richer easily in the primary. While Heap has not outright said that he believes those recent elections were stolen, he welcomed the backing of Lake and other prominent election deniers.\n\n\"He lost to a right-wing MAGA sycophant for Donald Trump,\" Kelly told the volunteers getting ready to knock on doors. Stringham \"has to win-make sure you tell them that it's really important that they get to that part of the ballot where they vote for Tim. Otherwise, we might have an issue here, once we get to when folks get sworn in for those positions.\"\n\nAnd it's not just about the recorder race. Not far away, at another canvassing event on Sunday, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs helped get out the vote for Daniel Valenzuela, a former firefighter who is running for the Maricopa Board of Supervisors. The Republican-controlled board, which basically is the county's governing council, \"is in 50 plus lines\" of business, Valenzuela explained, from education to public safety. But board members have drawn the ire of the far right for their handling of elections, where they're responsible for Election Day voting and tabulation. Two Republican supervisors who have drawn the ire of election deniers for certifying the last two elections, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, chose to retire this year. Another, Jack Sellers, was defeated in his primary by an election denier.\n\n\"I mean, these are solid supervisors regardless of party, sensible supervisors,\" Valenzuela told me. \"Two of them decided not to run for re-election, and one of them lost in his primary, and it wasn't close. And so what is the common thread there?\" Now he was running for Gates' old seat, in part, as a check against the anti-democratic impulses on the right.\n\nWith just a few days left until Election Day, Stringham had more or less stopped trying to find and persuade undecided voters and was trying to track down known supporters and Democrats who hadn't yet voted, to remind them of the importance of picking candidates for every option on the county's two-page ballot. But reaching crossover voters was a huge part of his campaign-as it has been for every Democrat who's won elections statewide or in Maricopa County in recent years. And Stringham believes that defending the election process in Maricopa is a winning issue.\n\n\"I think the truth is that most Arizonans actually like our election system,\" he said. \"We get a lot of complaints about things like the mail being slow, or, 'Why hasn't my ballot arrived yet?' There really aren't a lot of people who say, 'We want vote by mail to go away.' That really doesn't exist.\"\n\nHis comments were a dig at Heap, who joined Republicans in the legislature in an unsuccessful effort to do just that. One way Stringham can tell his argument resonates? Republicans seemed to be trying to steer away from election denial as a campaign issue in the final stretch.\n\n\"Turning Point right now is out there encouraging everybody to vote early,\" he said, referring to the political action committee, founded by Charlie Kirk, which is responsible for much of the Trump campaign's ground game in the state. \"They're doing the same thing we just did-rustling up ballots. So they're believing in the system, right?\"\n\nStringham believed that the GOP has realized their \"election denial strategy has failed, and they're trying to pivot away from it.\" He pointed to their avoidance of any questions about election denial, and how it has been abandoned as a talking point. His opponent is a perfect example of this new dynamic. \"He not only voted early, but he literally is sending out text messages that say he's running to make voting elections boring . He just took Richer's tagline!\" Stringham said. \"So they're sort of just trying to forget the world that happened in the last two, three, four years.\"\n\nThat is not to say that the election deniers have given up. Lake is still appealing her loss in the 2022 governor's race-in fact, the state supreme court will take another look at her arguments in the case on November 6 . There is no shortage of \"Stop the Steal\" candidates on the ballot, and Republicans are laying the groundwork to contest the results across the country should Trump fall short once again. But Stringham was on to something. For now, at least, Republican leaders are trying to get their voters to trust the process, not reject it.\n\nAt a Trump rally on Saturday in Scottsdale, Charlie Kirk leaned into the message that Republicans control their own destiny. All they had to do was \"chase\" the 400,000 Republican ballots that had not yet been turned in. At one point, he asked people in the crowd to take a look at the small, hangar-like space in which he was speaking. \"This seating section right here has about 280 people,\" he said. \"Our Attorney General in this state became Attorney General by 280 votes. And there were 200,000 Republicans that got ballots that did not submit them in the midterm election.\"\n\n\"We easily could have found 400 more votes. It's easy to complain, but we can only complain if we collapse on the finish line, everybody.\"\n\nThe Democratic AG, Kris Mayes, drew boos from the crowd when Kirk mentioned her recent announcement that she was instructing her criminal division to investigate Trump's comments about Liz Cheney. \"She's trying to investigate the speech of Donald Trump, but you know what? That's our fault, not her fault, because we didn't turn out the vote,\" he said. \"We easily could have found 300 more votes. We easily could have found 400 more votes. It's easy to complain, but we can only complain if we collapse on the finish line, everybody.\"\n\nThere was the usual chatter about making the election, as Donald Trump Jr. put it, \"too big to rig.\" But on an individual level, the voters I spoke with felt encouraged by their experiences with the system. I don't think it's a coincidence that almost everyone had voted by mail, something Republicans like Kirk have been pushing hard since 2022-in contrast to Trump's past assertions that it was just a way for Democrats to steal elections. Some of them said they were encouraged by the text alerts they'd received from the county recorder's office, which, per the county , updates voters when their ballot has been \"prepared, mailed, received, verified and counted.\" An added benefit to voting early is those voters were spared the sorts of Election Day annoyances-like overheating printers or long lines-that Republicans in the past have cited as proof of a plot against them.\n\nThen again, there may be a simpler reason to explain this sudden sunniness about the process: Most recent polls show Donald Trump ahead in the state. If those results hold, no one will need to conjure conspiracy theories to explain the results-they'll happily accept them.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

For nearly three months, Lake has spun one wild conspiracy theory after another to explain how and why she lost the Arizona gubernatorial race. Earlier this week, she tweeted out a series of images of voters' signatures-a \"BOMBSHELL DISCOVERY,\" the failed candidate announced-claiming that they showed a mismatch between the signatures Arizona has on file and those that ended up on ballots. Lake claimed that 40,000 people had voted illegally, using signatures that didn't match those on file. But in Arizona, publishing voters' signatures, if you're not the voter or an authorized representative, is a felony offense , as election law experts were quick to point out. In the wake of Lake's ill-conceived Twitter stunt, newly elected Secretary of State Adrian Fontes referred the matter to newly elected Attorney General Kris Mayes-both of whom had beaten out election deniers in the November election-for potential prosecution. Fontes wouldn't comment directly on the case during our conversation, but he did note that The Washington Post had published his letter to Mayes, including the unredacted version of Lake's tweet, urging that the GOP candidate be investigated for her actions. Fontes, who defeated election denier Mark Finchem back in November, has no patience for movements that seek to undermine confidence in democratic processes. In his mind, Lake and those who buy into her election denialism are doing \"a horrible thing for American democracy.\" Yet, he argues, the deniers are a waning force. \"I think there are fewer and fewer people who want to bother with this subject matter,\" he says. \"Generally speaking, I think the tide is turning.\" Opinion polls back this up. In the aftermath of the midterms, a majority of Republican voters reported that they thought the elections were free and fair. And roughly 60 percent of Americans believe that Trump's campaign to be elected president again come 2024-a campaign largely built on grievances about the 2020 election-is a bad thing. A recent analysis of voting patterns in Maricopa County, home to the huge urban sprawl of Phoenix, concluded that Lake, an election denier who faced a barrage of criticism not only from Democrats but also from Republicans such as Liz Cheney, lost because roughly 33,000 GOP-leaning voters in the county crossed over to support Democrat Katie Hobbs.

Look to Huawei. Want to Understand the New Cold War? Look to Huawei. Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers During this legislative session, Fontes estimates, there are fewer pieces of legislation with the intent of undermining the state's voting process being pushed by Arizona legislators than there were last year. It simply isn't, he says, the issue that is stirring people up in 2023. Instead, Fontes continues, \"folks are concerned with water, with education. These are the things Arizonans care about.\" S peaking of water, despite the epic rain and snowstorms out West this past month, the Colorado River is still being strained way beyond its capacity to deliver water to the 40 million Westerners who rely on it to meet their daily needs. Current Issue View our current issue In fact, so serious are the shortfalls, and so at risk are the huge hydroelectric plants and dams that keep water flowing into cities and generate the electric power that keeps the West's lights on, that the feds have mandated seven Western states to negotiate huge cuts in water usage or else face federally imposed rationing. Given how many mega-cities there are in this part of the country, and given the concentration of agriculture in California's Central Valley and other parts of the region, this is a vastly difficult task. Think of it as akin to the huge, decades-long effort required to rejuvenate the prairies and farmlands of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and neighboring parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas after the overworked topsoil blew off and created the desolation of the 1930s Dust Bowl. Perhaps not surprisingly, the states are lurching from one failed negotiation to the next as they attempt to square this circle. Most recently, California has played the role of spoiler, standing in the way of a settlement tentatively agreed on by water negotiators from Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming that would have saved upwards of 2 million acre-feet of water per year. California, which, having become a state before the others, boasts seniority in water rights in the region, is holding out, hoping to pass along deeper cuts to other states and to protect its own access to a dwindling water supply. California's own proposal for cuts is, reportedly, in the works, but it may be a case of smoke and mirrors. The feds are mandating reductions in water usage to get it down to sustainable levels in the long run. California is proposing using a baseline figure for water availability that ignores the millions of acre-feet lost each year to evaporation and during the process of moving water from one location to another. In other words, it is using an accounting quirk to pretend that the Colorado delivers more usable water than it does. It is then basing its proposed cuts-which, because of the system of priority water rights that govern the West, will fall largely on Arizona and Nevada, leaving California's water supplies mainly protected-on that notional, unreasonably high, baseline number. That's the sort of water-accounting gimmickry that got the West into so much hydrologic trouble to begin with. Just as election denialism undermines confidence in democratic systems, so water shortage denialism in an area prone to drought and with a mushrooming population undermines long-term solutions that could put the water-starved West on a path to long-term sustainability. If the Colorado River system, the dams and power plants strung along it, and the distribution structures that send out water to tens of millions of people fail, the effects will be truly calamitous. Better to work out painful, but viable, cuts now than to watch as the West's most important water supply is destroyed over the years to come.\n\nBut in Arizona, publishing voters' signatures, if you're not the voter or an authorized representative, is a felony offense , as election law experts were quick to point out. In the wake of Lake's ill-conceived Twitter stunt, newly elected Secretary of State Adrian Fontes referred the matter to newly elected Attorney General Kris Mayes-both of whom had beaten out election deniers in the November election-for potential prosecution. Fontes wouldn't comment directly on the case during our conversation, but he did note that The Washington Post had published his letter to Mayes, including the unredacted version of Lake's tweet, urging that the GOP candidate be investigated for her actions. Fontes, who defeated election denier Mark Finchem back in November, has no patience for movements that seek to undermine confidence in democratic processes. In his mind, Lake and those who buy into her election denialism are doing \"a horrible thing for American democracy.\" Yet, he argues, the deniers are a waning force. \"I think there are fewer and fewer people who want to bother with this subject matter,\" he says. \"Generally speaking, I think the tide is turning.\" Opinion polls back this up. In the aftermath of the midterms, a majority of Republican voters reported that they thought the elections were free and fair. And roughly 60 percent of Americans believe that Trump's campaign to be elected president again come 2024-a campaign largely built on grievances about the 2020 election-is a bad thing. A recent analysis of voting patterns in Maricopa County, home to the huge urban sprawl of Phoenix, concluded that Lake, an election denier who faced a barrage of criticism not only from Democrats but also from Republicans such as Liz Cheney, lost because roughly 33,000 GOP-leaning voters in the county crossed over to support Democrat Katie Hobbs.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers During this legislative session, Fontes estimates, there are fewer pieces of legislation with the intent of undermining the state's voting process being pushed by Arizona legislators than there were last year. It simply isn't, he says, the issue that is stirring people up in 2023. Instead, Fontes continues, \"folks are concerned with water, with education. These are the things Arizonans care about.\" S peaking of water, despite the epic rain and snowstorms out West this past month, the Colorado River is still being strained way beyond its capacity to deliver water to the 40 million Westerners who rely on it to meet their daily needs. Current Issue View our current issue In fact, so serious are the shortfalls, and so at risk are the huge hydroelectric plants and dams that keep water flowing into cities and generate the electric power that keeps the West's lights on, that the feds have mandated seven Western states to negotiate huge cuts in water usage or else face federally imposed rationing. Given how many mega-cities there are in this part of the country, and given the concentration of agriculture in California's Central Valley and other parts of the region, this is a vastly difficult task. Think of it as akin to the huge, decades-long effort required to rejuvenate the prairies and farmlands of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and neighboring parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas after the overworked topsoil blew off and created the desolation of the 1930s Dust Bowl. Perhaps not surprisingly, the states are lurching from one failed negotiation to the next as they attempt to square this circle. Most recently, California has played the role of spoiler, standing in the way of a settlement tentatively agreed on by water negotiators from Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming that would have saved upwards of 2 million acre-feet of water per year. California, which, having become a state before the others, boasts seniority in water rights in the region, is holding out, hoping to pass along deeper cuts to other states and to protect its own access to a dwindling water supply. California's own proposal for cuts is, reportedly, in the works, but it may be a case of smoke and mirrors. The feds are mandating reductions in water usage to get it down to sustainable levels in the long run. California is proposing using a baseline figure for water availability that ignores the millions of acre-feet lost each year to evaporation and during the process of moving water from one location to another. In other words, it is using an accounting quirk to pretend that the Colorado delivers more usable water than it does. It is then basing its proposed cuts-which, because of the system of priority water rights that govern the West, will fall largely on Arizona and Nevada, leaving California's water supplies mainly protected-on that notional, unreasonably high, baseline number. That's the sort of water-accounting gimmickry that got the West into so much hydrologic trouble to begin with. Just as election denialism undermines confidence in democratic systems, so water shortage denialism in an area prone to drought and with a mushrooming population undermines long-term solutions that could put the water-starved West on a path to long-term sustainability.

In other words, it is using an accounting quirk to pretend that the Colorado delivers more usable water than it does. It is then basing its proposed cuts-which, because of the system of priority water rights that govern the West, will fall largely on Arizona and Nevada, leaving California's water supplies mainly protected-on that notional, unreasonably high, baseline number. That's the sort of water-accounting gimmickry that got the West into so much hydrologic trouble to begin with. Just as election denialism undermines confidence in democratic systems, so water shortage denialism in an area prone to drought and with a mushrooming population undermines long-term solutions that could put the water-starved West on a path to long-term sustainability. If the Colorado River system, the dams and power plants strung along it, and the distribution structures that send out water to tens of millions of people fail, the effects will be truly calamitous. Better to work out painful, but viable, cuts now than to watch as the West's most important water supply is destroyed over the years to come.\n\nThat's the sort of water-accounting gimmickry that got the West into so much hydrologic trouble to begin with.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Kari Lake, heir apparent to Trumpism's refusal to accept ballot box defeats, sued Maricopa County in a Hail Mary effort to overturn the gubernatorial election result in Arizona. She argued that printer malfunctions and other Election Day problems added up to a deliberate effort to cheat her of victory and resulted in more than enough votes' not being counted to materially alter the outcome. Earlier this week, the judge in the two-day trial ruled against Lake , and ordered her to pay more than $33,000 in fees associated with her calling of so-called \"expert\" witnesses to challenge the vote count. Lake vowed to appeal the ruling to the Arizona Supreme Court, but, like Trump's challenges to the outcome of the 2020 election, the onetime Fox News anchor's arguments are flimsy at best, and dishonest and antidemocratic at worst. It is, perhaps, tempting fate to assume that she cannot win on appeal, but given the paucity of evidence to support her cause, the likelihood of the courts reversing her election loss seems on a par with the likelihood of Trump suddenly developing a case of humility. Historians will likely look at 2022 as the year that American democracy came closer to imploding than at any other point since the Civil War. Trump's relentless attempts at sabotage, backed by a shockingly large part of the GOP, represented an enormous stress test of basic American institutions. Had a few tens of thousands of voters in each of a few key states not rebelled against the MAGA movement and its imposition of extremist candidates-who pledged to use their offices to provide a glide path to Trump's efforts to secure power once again-states like Arizona would have become epicenters of a new American autocracy. Had Lake been elected governor, instead of losing by 17,000 votes, and had candidates such as Mark Finchem been elected as secretaries of state, the next chapters in America's political story would have been dark indeed. Instead, the election deniers were handed a drubbing, and Trump now looks decidedly like yesterday's grifter. His money-raising efforts-most recently his absurd sale of NFT Trump-superhero cards-are more and more outrageous, and his legal woes are accumulating at a faster rate than snow during a Buffalo blizzard. On a daily basis, Trump's balloon, inflated by his own hot air, is falling rapidly back to earth. Take, for example, his NFT cards , 45,000 of which were sold to gullible MAGA enthusiasts at $99 a pop. They lost more than 70 percent of their value in one week. Trump is even being challenged for the title of Fabulist of the Year from within his own party. Sure, his tax returns suggest a penchant for playing fast and loose with key parts of his biography (like the \"being a billionaire\" part), but at least he's not incoming Representative George Santos , who apparently created an entire fictive persona out of whole cloth and successfully sold it to Long Island voters. Educational qualifications that he didn't have. Jobs he'd never occupied. A Jewish heritage that wasn't his. Money he didn't possess. A real estate mini-empire that was nothing more than a figment of his imagination. In a sane world, Santos, the perfect incarnation of the Trumpian \"it's true if I say it's so\" ethos, wouldn't be seated in Congress come January. In a Kevin McCarthy world, the one in which Marjorie Taylor Greene was promised pretty much everything including the kitchen sink in exchange for her support for his leadership bid, Santos will probably be invited in for a lengthy one-on-one with the member of Congress from Bakersfield; at the end of this meeting he'll pledge to support McCarthy's bid for House speaker in return for McCarthy's promise to circle the wagons to protect Santos from ethics investigations and possible expulsion from the chamber. Just one more Faustian bargain by a GOP leadership now void of any animating principle other than that of power for the sake of power. There are, however, signs that even many within the GOP have finally had enough of the circus unleashed by Trump. In the final days of this Congress, legislators voted to overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act , explicitly codifying the ceremonial role of the vice president in certifying the Electoral College vote, and raising the bar for the number of senators or representatives needed to challenge a state's electors. The reform was marketed by senators from both parties as a way to firewall the system against a repeat of January 6. Few senators are rushing to Trump's defense these days, as he rants against the courts and law enforcement, dines with Nazis, flirts with QAnon, and urges a suspension of constitutional governance so that he can be reinstalled in power. Few rushed to support Kari Lake as she tried to apply a battering ram to Arizona's democratic infrastructure. Few shed public tears for the defeat of Herschel Walker, Blake Masters, and other Trump-wannabes. Increasingly, Donald Trump and his merry pranksters are seen as irrelevances, as hindrances, as losers .

Activate your online access\n\nExpect the GOP to flood the zone with polls that likely aren't worth the paper they're written on.\n\nFormer Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake watches a prerecorded video of former president Donald Trump giving Lake his endorsement in the race for the seat of Senator Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) on October 10, 2023, at JetSet Magazine 's offices in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nEarlier this month, Newsweek and other reputable media outlets covered the latest Peak Insights poll on the Arizona Senate race with hyperbolic statements about it being good news for Kari Lake. The GOP candidate has frittered away her ability to win over a critical mass of moderates by spending the nearly two years since her defeat in the 2022 gubernatorial race spewing Trump-styled election denialism and conspiracy theories. So polling in her favor, and against her Democratic challenger, Ruben Gallego , who has meticulously built a lead against Lake, was just the right bit of news to spice up the horse-race reportage.\n\nLake's PR machine went into overdrive , releasing a statement saying the poll showed the race was a dead heat, and using the opportunity to bash Gallego for supposedly supporting an open border and other positions that GOP strategists have identified as being particularly unpopular with voters.\n\nThe only problem was that the Peak Insights poll was paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and was way out of whack with most other recent polls -a minor inconvenience largely ignored in Newsweek's coverage. In fact, a High Ground poll recently found Gallego up 11 percent,; a New York Times poll had Gallego up about 8 percent, Noble Predictive Insights had Gallego up 7 percent, and Redfield & Wilton Strategies had the Democrat up by more than 5 percent. The one other poll that produced results anywhere close to that of the Peak Insights poll was by WPA Intelligence, which had Gallego up by only 2 percent. But it turns out that that poll, too, was partisan, and paid for by the GOP-aligned super PAC, the Club for Growth Action.\n\nTrying to skew the polling average by throwing in outlier polls such as Peak Insights' is among the more unsavory developments of recent election cycles. Both parties have looked to game the system this way in the hopes of presenting momentum shifts to jazz up their base. Two years ago, Democrats withdrew from the race against conservative Utah Senator Mike Lee and threw their weight behind independent challenger Evan McMullin. Realistically, McMullin was never going to defeat Lee. Yet for a few weeks in the run-up to the 2022 election, some Democratic-aligned pollsters produced numbers showing that he was competitive with the incumbent senator. In the end, Lee won by more than 10 percent.\n\nIn the battleground states of the desert West, it is GOP-aligned and funded pollsters that seem to be on a tear, with their release of low-quality polls far out of whack with an array of nonpartisan surveys this election cycle.\n\nIn Arizona, says Mike Noble, of Predictive Insights, the reputable polling companies have all shown the presidential race to be tightening, with some polls giving Harris a small lead and others giving Trump the edge. Noble's latest numbers, part of a rolling survey he releases on a quarterly basis, show Trump narrowly ahead; but, he says, that's not terribly out of line with the New York Times poll showing Harris pulling ahead.\n\n\"They're all telling you the same thing,\" he explains. \"Arizona is incredibly close, incredibly competitive.\"\n\nMoreover, his numbers show that, whereas in the spring and early summer a majority of Democrats in the state were thinking about their ballot in terms of voting against Trump rather than for Biden, since the president announced that he wouldn't seek reelection and stood aside for Kamala Harris, there's been a marked shift among Democrats. Now, a majority of Democrats in the state say they are voting for Harris rather than simply in opposition to Trump. That, Noble believes, shows a huge shift in enthusiasm toward the Democrats. Harris has, according to these polls, narrowed or eliminated the gap both in a scenario in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remains in the race, and in a one-on-one contest with Trump.\n\nThose same polls that show the presidential race to be basically a toss-up in the state have consistently shown Kari Lake, who has burned a huge number of bridges in the past couple years, to be lagging several points behind Trump. And Noble believes that Gallego likely has an even bigger lead than the polling averages suggest, since the polls put out by GOP-affiliated pollsters are skewing the numbers in Lake's favor and allowing her to put out press releases and fundraising e-mails arguing that the race is still a toss-up.\n\nA similar story is unfolding in neighboring Nevada. There, independent pollsters have consistently found that incumbent Democratic Senator Jackie Rosen has consolidated a comfortable lead over her GOP challenger, Sam Brown. But the polling averages are skewed  by numbers generated by Remington Research Group , whose Nevada polling is paid for by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, another GOP-affiliated political action committee, and which has found Rosen's lead to be only 2 percent.\n\nThis is, Noble argues, a direct consequence of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. The 2010 ruling opened the floodgates for outside spending by companies and lobbyists looking to impact elections, oftentimes in deeply underhanded ways. \"When you're playing at this high-stakes level for power, and the rules say you can do it, why not?\" the pollster says. The result is \"polls that may not reflect the actual realities.\"\n\nIf Georgia, with its newly minted super-partisan board of elections, is now ground zero for election-deniers seeking to foul up the vote count and certification, should it look like Trump is heading for another defeat, Arizona and Nevada might well be ground zero for using partisan polling to muddy the waters.\n\n\"This election's going to get weirder before it gets more normal,\" Noble says. And, as it does so, expect the GOP to flood the zone with polls on Lake's and Brown's Senate prospects-and quite possibly Trump's prospects in key swing states-that likely aren't worth the paper they're written on.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nRepublican-funded polling is simply not credible; the presidential race will be nail-bitingly close.\n\nArizona residents wait in line to vote early at the Indian Bend Wash Visitor Center on October 30, 2024,, in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nGOP-funded pollsters and polling groups with outlier results continue to flood the zone with polls of, at best, dubious credibility. Arizona-which Ad Impact now rates as the second-most-spent-on state in the country, after California, for media ads on political races-remains the ground zero of this misinformation game. The most recent example: Data Orbital , which has been awarded a diamond mark of credibility by FiveThirtyEight, published a poll earlier this week showing Donald Trump up eight in Arizona. It also shows Kari Lake ahead of Ruben Gallego in the US Senate race.\n\nThis polling is simply not credible, flying in the face of dozens of other surveys over the past year that have shown the presidential race in the state to be a dead heat and Lake to be considerably behind Gallego in the Senate contest. If I were into conspiracy theories-which, of course, I'm not-I'd say this one was shaping up to be a doozie: The GOP pumps bad data into the polling universe to create a false sense of momentum, and then, when the election result doesn't go the way those polls suggest it will, the GOP and its election-denying base cries foul, launches a whole bunch of phony investigations, files lawsuits, and does everything it can to gum up the certification process, making it more likely that a Democratic-leaning Arizona won't be able to certify its electors in time for Congress to count them.\n\nMike Noble, an Arizona-based pollster I have talked to several times in this cycle who believes the GOP is deliberately skewing the numbers with bad polling data, is furious. All the evidence that he and his team have gathered shows that the Arizona race is incredibly tight, and nothing they have seen suggests it broke decisively for Trump this week. They published their last statewide poll of the election cycle on Thursday, alongside a national poll that shows Harris up three points . In Arizona, Noble's data has Trump up only 1 percent, with 48 percent to Harris's 47, and with Gallego up four points.\n\nAll of the Arizona presidential polls showing such a close outcome leave open the possibility that the Democrats can overcome the Trump lead through a stronger ground game and a rigorous get-out-the-vote operation that they have spent years developing.\n\nThe last couple of election cycles provide precedent for just this scenario. Noble points out that in 2022 Data Orbital published poll after poll showing Lake significantly ahead in the governor's race. It may or may not have been a coincidence that, as local media reported, Lake's campaign had employed the father of George Khalaf, founder of the polling firm, as its treasurer.\n\nKhalaf's numbers helped to skew the averages toward the Republican; in the end, however, the Democratic candidate, Katie Hobbs, won the election. In the final poll of that season, the company predicted clear wins for the GOP election-deniers running for secretary of state and for attorney general. Those predictions also turned out to be wrong; the Democrats won both of those races as well. In other words, just because a pollster throws a bunch of numbers into the mix that make it look like the GOP is surging, that doesn't mean there's a real surge.\n\nAs Mike Tomasky recently wrote in The New Republic , the GOP bad-poll gimmick isn't just an Arizona phenomenon. Similar manipulation of data has occurred in many of the swing states, rendering the rush of last-minute polls little more than a campaign prop.\n\nYet The New York Times continues to fall for the GOP strategy hook, line, and sinker, building into their rolling averages numbers from Data Orbital, the right-leaning Redfield & Wilton Strategies, and the Trafalgar Group. Of the last six polls in Arizona, four have come from these groups, with Data Orbital's being given a disproportionate weight. That average, as a result, now puts Trump up 3 percent, roughly the same as the lead Lake supposedly had just before she lost the governor's race to Katie Hobbs. Presumably, many of those supposedly reliable Republican voters who rejected Lake as being too extreme are, at the very least, having reservations about casting their ballots for the equally extreme Trump, meaning it's more than likely Trump's lead in Arizona is as much a desert mirage as was Lake's two years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, on the ground, away from the noise of the polls, the SEIU, the culinary workers, and the hotel workers' unions are putting together their most ambitious door-knocking campaigns ever in both Arizona and in Nevada, with hundreds of canvassers, data analysts, and logistics experts saturating the large metropolitan areas in both states in a huge effort to identify likely Harris voters and then get them to actually vote.\n\nAccording to Ted Papageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the culinary workers' union in Nevada, his outfit alone has fielded 600 people: \"room cleaners, house cleaners, cooks, and servers...workers talking to workers,\" he said. \"We've got boots on the ground-an army of workers.\" In several recent elections, that huge effort in Las Vegas has ultimately made the difference, helping push Democrats such as presidential candidate Joe Biden and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto to narrow victories.\n\nIn Arizona, UNITE HERE! Local 11 and the affiliated 501c4 group Workers' Power have combined to put several hundred union canvassers on the ground in Phoenix, looking to convert promises to vote for Harris into actual ballots cast. Susan Minato, the union local's copresident and chair of Worker Power's Board of Trustees, explains that their A-team canvassers-union members who have taken months of leave from their jobs to knock on doors in Phoenix-are reaching out to huge numbers of these voters over the coming days. \"Moving the yes vote. Identify them and then move them,\" Minato says of the challenge facing the canvassers in the crucial last days before Election Day. \"It's a tight, tight race, but this is the best we can do. We have more than 250 people on the ground.\" There are also hundreds of volunteers supplementing the paid canvassers, fanning out across Phoenix to explain the stakes in an election in which Trump has embraced a harsh anti-democracy, and anti-immigrant, message.\n\nIt's true that early voting numbers in both states have skewed Republican, unlike in 2020, when Trump all-but-ordered his supporters not to cast ballots early. But in both states, roughly a third of the electorate is independent, and there's no evidence that independents have decisively broken for Trump. Papageorge thinks the result is going to be close-likely closer than in 2020, when Biden beat out Trump in Nevada by roughly 30,000 votes-but he believes that ultimately the union effort will win out.\n\nMy prediction? Ruben Gallego will win his Senate race in Arizona, and Jackie Rosen will win hers in Nevada. Neither of these elections will be particularly close. If the union canvas and Democratic Party's ground game over the next several days work as planned, one, and possibly two, Arizona congressional seats could flip to the Democrats, which, in tandem with a couple likely pickups in California (in the Central Valley and in Orange County), as well as a smattering of pickups in other states, ought to be enough to give the Democrats control of the US House of Representatives come 2025. And with an abortion access measure on the ballot that is likely to drive progressives to the polls in high numbers, it isn't beyond the bounds of the possible that at least one of the two Arizona legislative chambers will either go from being controlled by the GOP to being a tie. Conceivably, they might even flip to the Democrats.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nAs for the presidential race, it will, clearly, be nail-bitingly close; for reasons that I find utterly unfathomable, Trump and his fascist messaging continue to hold a cultlike death grip over a huge part of the electorate. But at the end of the day, the unions' get-out-the-vote effort is extremely well-organized-far better than the chaotic ground game of the Republicans and of late-entry allies such as Elon Musk-and has a proven track record in both states. And there is, as a result, Data Orbital's latest numbers notwithstanding, a narrow pathway to victory for Harris in Nevada and Arizona.\n\nSo if you're reading this and know people in those states still sitting on the fence or pondering not voting, get on the phone and explain to them exactly what is at stake in this election. Oftentimes, it's hard to see how an individual's vote matters. In Nevada and Arizona over the coming days, every vote could end up being the margin between victory and defeat.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nArizona Democratic officials say the primary results don't reflect \"what the majority of Arizonans think.\"\n\nAt the end of July, in a low-turnout primary in which only about 25 percent of GOP-registered voters cast ballots, Arizonan Republicans voted for all the non-presidential candidates on the November ballot. The vote counts are now complete, and the verdict is in: Up and down the ballot, the GOP base opted for hard-core election deniers, many of whom had been endorsed by former president Donald Trump.\n\nShould these election deniers somehow thread the needle and win in the general election, Arizona's politics would swing further rightward, and its voting processes would be overseen by officials who deny the legitimacy of the past two elections and hope to put up all kinds of obstacles to voter participation. That would spell trouble for the future of the process in the Grand Canyon State no matter who is in the White House.\n\nIn the most high-profile race, defeated gubernatorial candidate and Trump-wannabe Kari Lake was nominated to be a Senate candidate . She won approximately 54 percent of the vote, with her only major opponent being a local sheriff who, short of money, ran a bare-bones campaign that never was going to represent a serious challenge to the fiery former news anchor. Lake, who shot to national fame in the wake of the 2020 election largely by parroting Trump's lies about a stolen victory, and who has spent the past 20-plus months denying that she lost the governor's race to Katie Hobbs-racking up a series of expensive legal defeats in the process-will now compete against progressive Ruben Gallego in one of the country's most important Senate races.\n\nLake wasn't alone in using the GOP base's suspicion of the electoral process to her advantage. In Maricopa County, the moderate Republican county recorder, Stephen Richer, who stood up to the MAGA mob's attacks on the voting process and to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the Phoenix area, was defeated in the primary by Justin Heap . In the state legislature, Heap has voted to oppose the use of electronic counting of ballots; he wants to eliminate almost all early voting; and, if he is elected in November, he hopes to bar the use of large voting centers. He wants to replace these centers with small precincts capped at 1,000 registered voters per precinct, which experts have said would render the voting and vote-counting process in a large city like Phoenix far more difficult.\n\nAnother defender of the integrity of the 2020 and 2022 elections, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chair Jack Sellars was also defeated by a roughly two-to-one margin.\n\nThe list of victorious election deniers, and defeated moderates, is a long one. In the hotly contested primary race for Congressional District 8, a highly conservative district in which the GOP is all but assured of winning come November, election denier Abe Hamadeh won out over a bevy of opponents, including defeated Senate candidate (and fellow election denier) Blake Masters. In CD 3, a safely Democrat seat being vacated by Ruben Gallego, the firebrand conservative Jeff Zink , who attended the infamous January 6, 2021, rally in DC, easily won the GOP nomination.\n\nAnd in an ultra-red state legislative district, Mark Finchem , who unsuccessfully ran for secretary of sate on one of the country's most extreme election-denying platforms in 2022, knocked off the relatively moderate GOP incumbent Ken Bennett , all but guaranteeing himself a place in the legislature come 2025.\n\nWith the GOP in Arizona marching entirely in lockstep with the election-denialist predilections of Trump, there is a danger that the machinery for running elections and counting ballots will at some point end up in the hands of extremists. But it's also more than likely that the GOP, in lurching so far to the right during its primary season, will ultimately poison its relationship to the broader voting public in Arizona. After all, over the past decade the state has gone from being reliably red to being generally purple, and since 2018 most of the key national and state races have ended up narrowly going in the Democrats' favor. Eighteen people have been charged in the false electors plot from 2020, and recently the first of these pleaded guilty-all of which has kept in the public eye GOP extremism around this issue.\n\nAs I wrote earlier this year, it is certainly possible that in Arizona the unreconstructed MAGA movement will take its last, ugly stand , and will end up being handed a series of stinging defeats by voters in the general election. Most recent polls have shown Gallego building a lead against Lake in the Senate race, and with an abortion rights initiative now qualified for the ballot in November after its sponsors submitted hundreds of thousands of signatures earlier this summer, it's likely that Democratic voters will be particularly energized heading into the general election.\n\nSecretary of State Adrian Fontes, who is responsible for upholding the integrity of the state's voting processes, believes that last week's primary results show more about the direction the GOP is taking in Arizona than about where the populace as a whole is on these issues. \"I don't think the state will go the way the Republican Party has gone,\" he told me this week. \"I don't think it encompasses what the majority of Arizonans think.\"\n\nFontes, who defeated Finchem in 2022 , and who currently is an executive board member of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of States, believes that Arizona's electoral processes are strong, and that they will survive the assault the current incarnation of the GOP is launching against them. \"Doom and gloom I think is overrated,\" he says pithily. This past week's results, he argues, \"say a lot about the Republican Party and Republican primary voters. But that's a small vote compared to the whole.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

It is more than possible, however, that, as was the case in the 2022 gubernatorial race-which Democrat Katie Hobbs eventually won, after she had trailed Kari Lake for much of the election season-the polls are missing some crucial below-the-surface trends.\n\nSince July, UNITE HERE Local 11 canvassers, along with community members of the social welfare organization Worker Power, have knocked on nearly three-quarters of a million doors, many of them belonging to groups that have a low voting rate, such as young people, people of color, or poor or low-income people. It is the largest and most efficient canvas the group has ever done, says Brendan Walsh, executive director of Worker Power, who believes it is what will make a difference in the down-to-the-wire contest.\n\nIn 2020, the UNITE HERE/Worker Power canvas knocked on over 1 million doors in Arizona, and was a vital component in Biden's effort to win the state's 11 Electoral College votes. This time around, using sophisticated voter-outreach software to reach out to Democratic-leaning, independent, and undecided voters, they have a target of knocking on 1.3 million doors and having conversations with a quarter of a million voters. They will almost certainly surpass these numbers.\n\nThis week, Worker Power released data based on its interviews with close to 150,000 people across the state since the canvas launched in July. They found huge levels of concern around reproductive rights, especially among affluent suburban voters-and that 80 percent of voters for whom this was their number-one issue were planning to vote for Kamala Harris. They found that significant numbers of moderate, GOP-leaning voters in those suburbs-the sorts of voters for whom ex-senator Jeff Flake's recent endorsement of Kamala Harris might actually matter-were planning to vote for Harris. And they found that among Democratic-leaning voters who said the economy was their number-one priority, most planned to vote for Harris. This finding suggests that Trump's strategy of using economic concerns to peel off Democratic-leaning voters isn't working out among key constituencies in the state. As importantly, given the purported power of immigration as a wedge issue in the 2024 election, the canvassers found that among the Democratic and independent voters they have contacted, it isn't a top-three issue. It was crowded out by concerns about abortion access, the economy, and democracy.\n\nNow, it's possible that ultimately many of these voters, too often dismissed as \"low-propensity\" or \"low-engagement\" voters, won't ultimately cast ballots. But over the past few election cycles canvassers for Worker Power and other groups have had marked success in turning out these voters. And, despite GOP efforts to rein in early voting, this week ballots went out to every Arizona resident. That means, Walsh explains, that \"every day is now as important as Election Day.\"\n\nGiven that complex reality, the ground game matters more than ever. And there simply is no effort on the GOP side anywhere close to the size and sophistication of the Worker Power canvas. \"We have the tools to make a difference,\" Walsh explains. \"We've proved it in every election\" over the past several cycles, helping deliver both US Senate seats to Democrats, winning the governorship and state attorney general's office, and in 2020 delivering Arizona into Biden's column.

The result, all too predictably, was chaos.\n\nKari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for the governorship in 2022 on a Trumpian platform of election denialism and harsh anti-immigrant sentiments and is now the front-runner to become the GOP's candidate for the upcoming US Senate race, couldn't work out which side of the issue she was on. The television news anchor cum politician, who once supported banning abortion pills and reinstating the 1864 territorial-era law that bars all abortions and imprisons abortion providers, now doesn't support banning all abortions . Instead, she told NBC, she favors an Arizona law signed by Governor Ducey in 2022 that, if it ends up replacing the reinstated territorial law, would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nLake's newly moderate positions holds, except when it doesn't. Speaking to a newspaper in Idaho-a state that has an even more extreme abortion ban in place, so extreme that US Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett might actually vote with the liberals in holding it to be unconstitutional-she suggested that she does, indeed, support the draconian 1864 law. \"Unfortunately,\" she said, \"the people running our state have said we're not going to enforce it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the state legislature, a majority of Republicans spent a week blocking efforts to overturn the law, which is slated to kick in in early June unless it is repealed before then. Behind the scenes, many also plotted ways to sabotage the abortion rights initiative heading to the ballot this November. A leaked memo showed elected officials looking for ways to qualify multiple different \"abortion rights\" initiatives, most of which wouldn't genuinely protect abortion access, and would in fact add an array of restrictions around abortion into the state Constitution, in order to dilute support for the Arizona for Access initiative. That initiative, which already has far more than enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, actually would enshrine abortion rights into the state Constitution. Abortion rights advocates will be going all out in the coming months to educate voters about it and bring them out to the polls come November.\n\nIf the Supreme Court ruling takes effect, Arizona will join states such as Texas and Idaho in imposing a near-total and harshly punitive abortion ban, against the wishes of a vast majority of its voters. So on Wednesday of this week, a coalition of three moderate Republicans-Timothy Dunn, Matt Gress, and Justin Wilmeth-joined Democrats in the House to finally pass that repeal of the territorial law. It has now been sent over to the Senate, where Republicans only have a two-seat majority-and where two GOP senators have already indicated that they want to repeal the legislation and replace it with a 15-week limit on abortion. It is more than likely that a repeal bill will soon head to Governor Katie Hobbs's desk for her signature.\n\nNone of this bodes well for the GOP. Whether the state legislature gets its act together to repeal the 1864 law or not, at this point the GOP owns the mess. The party is at war with itself over whether and how to limit abortion access, pragmatists who can read the political tea leaves versus purists who want to push for ever-more-restrictive abortion policies.\n\nThe legislative fix pushed to nullify the 1864 law-a fix that should have been a no-brainer for the GOP to adopt-will pass, if it does pass, only because a few sensibly moderate Republicans were willing to break with the majority of their party colleagues and vote with a united Democratic caucus in favor of repeal. Even then, it's hardly a dream bill for abortion rights advocates, failing to include exceptions for victims of rape or incest who require abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.\n\nMoreover, the repeal won't kick in for 90 days, meaning there will be a gap of several weeks between the law kicking in and the repeal taking effect. During those weeks, if abortion is temporarily forbidden in Arizona, the Democrats will certainly make as much political hay as possible-and many Arizona providers, who, as a result of legislation being fast-tracked through the California legislature will soon be allowed to practice across the state line , will likely temporarily shift their business to border towns on the California side. As a result, while Republicans try to shift the conversation onto other issues, Democrats will have a golden opportunity for months on end to paint the GOP as extremists unconcerned about driving women out of state to seek basic medical care.\n\nMeanwhile, on the right, there are growing rumblings of discontent from the anti-choice voters who make up the GOP base, who worry that they're now being sold out by politicians more interested in favorable poll numbers than in ideological purity or consistency around abortion. Anti-choice legislators slammed their three colleagues for voting with the Democrats to repeal the 1864 law, and shortly after the vote Gress was removed from his position on the House Appropriations Committee. House Speaker Ben Toma wrote that he was \"deeply disappointed\" in the outcome. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser put out a statement mourning the babies who would be aborted after repeal of \"Arizona's strongest pro-life law.\"\n\nBarely six months out from the election, Arizona's abortion battles have heated up to the boiling point. For the Republicans, the timing couldn't have been worse.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

(Brandon Bell / Getty Images)\n\nTwo years ago, Arizona was one of the five pivotal swing states that won President Joe Biden an Electoral College majority. On Tuesday, Donald Trump, still fighting to overturn and rewrite his humiliating defeat, succeeded in his campaign to drum out of the GOP's upper strata in Arizona any politicians who doesn't fully buy into his \"Stop the Steal\" lies about the 2020 result. Outgoing Governor Doug Ducey, who roused the disgraced ex-president's wrath by refusing to challenge certification of the Arizona election result, endorsed-along with most of the party's establishment figures- Karrin Robson to be the GOP candidate in the race to succeed him. But Trump endorsed Kari Lake, a fiery and opportunistic television personality who has gone all in on Trumpism in recent years. While the votes are still being counted, at this point it looks like Lake has narrowly won. In the race for US Senate nominee, Trump endorsed the extremist venture capitalist Blake Masters , a protégé of Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump adviser Peter Thiel . So, too, did neo-Nazi publisher Andrew Anglin , who founded The Daily Stormer nine years ago. Masters handily beat out his more moderate rivals, who hadn't fully gotten with the plan in terms of their views on the validity of the 2020 election. Trump also came out a winner in the race for the GOP candidate for Arizona secretary of state. He endorsed election-denier Mark Finchem , an extremist state rep whose previous claim to fame was introducing a bill last year, HCR 2033 , that would have allowed legislators to overturn the will of the people in the state's three most populous and Democratic-leaning counties-Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma-and simply choose whom to assign their electors to in a disputed presidential election. Finchem won a four-way race with more than 40 percent of the vote. If elected in November, Finchem, a QAnon supporter and member of the extremist Oath Keepers militia, has pledged to end early voting (a critical part of the state's electoral apparatus), to curtail or end the use of electronic voting machines, and to implement strict voter ID laws. He is one of several candidates for secretary of state around the country whom Trump has endorsed, apparently with the intent of entirely capturing vulnerable election apparatuses so as to make it easier to challenge unfavorable election results should the need arise.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers All of which will make for an interesting three months in the run-up to the November midterm elections in a state that has for the past several election cycles been more purple than reliably red, which voted for Biden in 2020, and which currently has two Democratic senators. For decades now, Arizona's GOP has swung ever further rightward, even as the broader electorate in Arizona has gradually become more liberal. This week's results simply accelerate long-standing trends. Current Issue View our current issue Arizona's GOP has a long and dishonorable record of tacking to the extreme right, especially in primary season, when red meat must be fed to the base. This is the state that produced Barry Goldwater and his extremist presidential candidacy of 1964. It is a state whose GOP leaders, a decade ago, passed SB 1070 , arguably the most extreme anti-immigrant measure in the country at the time. It's a state that sent white nationalist Representative Paul Gosar to D.C.-and propelled him to another primary victory yesterday with 65 percent of the vote, despite a string of recent actions in which Gosar has ever more explicitly tied his political fortune to racist and fascist ideologies and groups. It's a state that embraces state senators such as Wendy Rogers , who routinely call for violence to be meted out against their political opponents. It's the state that turned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio -who specialized in terrorizing undocumented immigrants, and tormenting his jail inmates with the chain gang and a slew of other humiliation rituals-into an icon for the nativist right in America. But it's also a state that has, in recent years, seen one of the country's most potent organizing efforts to counter far-right politicians and to raise the profile of progressives. Trade unions such as UNITE Here! Local 11 have helped coordinate huge get-out-the-vote efforts in recent elections and are already on the ground in Arizona working on the midterm election campaigns. Immigrants' rights groups have succeeded in substantial voter registration efforts over the past decade. As a result, politics in Arizona in 2022 is a far cry from what it was even a decade ago. Blake Masters is hoping to unseat Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. Yet recent polling gives the incumbent a large lead over his opponent. Kari Lake is hoping to succeed Doug Ducey. She talks incessantly about the supposed stealing of the 2020 election, and has already warned her supporters that if she loses in November, it will be because dead people voted against her. Seeking to position herself as a culture warrior, she has in recent months gone to war against drag queens and other targets of opportunity. Yet she is trailing Democratic Party candidate Katie Hobbs-currently Arizona's secretary of state-by between 5 and 10 percent, according to a number of recent polls . There isn't polling on Finchem's race, but despite the flurry of loud GOP voices proclaiming fealty to the idea of a stolen election, even the GOP's own officials in Maricopa County were unable to find evidence of systemic voter fraud impacting the 2020 vote. Given this, it's hard to see how a delusionist of Finchem's caliber will be able to build a viable electoral coalition that goes beyond the die-hard Republicans who have already gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole and drunk the Trumpian Kool-Aid. Moreover, on key national issues, the far-right candidates the GOP has nominated are massively out of sync with public opinion. Lake, Finchem, Masters, all oppose abortion rights. Yet more than seven in 10 Arizonans believe in preserving reproductive freedoms. Eighty percen t of Arizonans want a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and for holders of Temporary Protected Status; on the subject of immigration, this puts them at loggerheads with all the leading GOP candidates. A large majority of Arizonans support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. A similarly large majority support a rapid transition to a clean energy economy. Again, the GOP opposes these changes. There is, in other words, a pathway-albeit narrow-for the Democrats to consolidate their political takeover of Arizona in this election season. The party has nominated eminently sensible politicians to fight key races. By contrast, the GOP has opted for extremism. In his bilious revenge campaign against the so-called RINOs surrounding Ducey, Trump has facilitated the triumph of the crackpot wing of Arizona's GOP. It's hard to see how this bodes well for the party in November's general election.\n\nOutgoing Governor Doug Ducey, who roused the disgraced ex-president's wrath by refusing to challenge certification of the Arizona election result, endorsed-along with most of the party's establishment figures- Karrin Robson to be the GOP candidate in the race to succeed him.

He endorsed election-denier Mark Finchem , an extremist state rep whose previous claim to fame was introducing a bill last year, HCR 2033 , that would have allowed legislators to overturn the will of the people in the state's three most populous and Democratic-leaning counties-Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma-and simply choose whom to assign their electors to in a disputed presidential election. Finchem won a four-way race with more than 40 percent of the vote. If elected in November, Finchem, a QAnon supporter and member of the extremist Oath Keepers militia, has pledged to end early voting (a critical part of the state's electoral apparatus), to curtail or end the use of electronic voting machines, and to implement strict voter ID laws. He is one of several candidates for secretary of state around the country whom Trump has endorsed, apparently with the intent of entirely capturing vulnerable election apparatuses so as to make it easier to challenge unfavorable election results should the need arise.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers All of which will make for an interesting three months in the run-up to the November midterm elections in a state that has for the past several election cycles been more purple than reliably red, which voted for Biden in 2020, and which currently has two Democratic senators. For decades now, Arizona's GOP has swung ever further rightward, even as the broader electorate in Arizona has gradually become more liberal. This week's results simply accelerate long-standing trends. Current Issue View our current issue Arizona's GOP has a long and dishonorable record of tacking to the extreme right, especially in primary season, when red meat must be fed to the base. This is the state that produced Barry Goldwater and his extremist presidential candidacy of 1964. It is a state whose GOP leaders, a decade ago, passed SB 1070 , arguably the most extreme anti-immigrant measure in the country at the time. It's a state that sent white nationalist Representative Paul Gosar to D.C.-and propelled him to another primary victory yesterday with 65 percent of the vote, despite a string of recent actions in which Gosar has ever more explicitly tied his political fortune to racist and fascist ideologies and groups. It's a state that embraces state senators such as Wendy Rogers , who routinely call for violence to be meted out against their political opponents. It's the state that turned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio -who specialized in terrorizing undocumented immigrants, and tormenting his jail inmates with the chain gang and a slew of other humiliation rituals-into an icon for the nativist right in America. But it's also a state that has, in recent years, seen one of the country's most potent organizing efforts to counter far-right politicians and to raise the profile of progressives. Trade unions such as UNITE Here! Local 11 have helped coordinate huge get-out-the-vote efforts in recent elections and are already on the ground in Arizona working on the midterm election campaigns. Immigrants' rights groups have succeeded in substantial voter registration efforts over the past decade. As a result, politics in Arizona in 2022 is a far cry from what it was even a decade ago. Blake Masters is hoping to unseat Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. Yet recent polling gives the incumbent a large lead over his opponent. Kari Lake is hoping to succeed Doug Ducey. She talks incessantly about the supposed stealing of the 2020 election, and has already warned her supporters that if she loses in November, it will be because dead people voted against her. Seeking to position herself as a culture warrior, she has in recent months gone to war against drag queens and other targets of opportunity. Yet she is trailing Democratic Party candidate Katie Hobbs-currently Arizona's secretary of state-by between 5 and 10 percent, according to a number of recent polls . There isn't polling on Finchem's race, but despite the flurry of loud GOP voices proclaiming fealty to the idea of a stolen election, even the GOP's own officials in Maricopa County were unable to find evidence of systemic voter fraud impacting the 2020 vote. Given this, it's hard to see how a delusionist of Finchem's caliber will be able to build a viable electoral coalition that goes beyond the die-hard Republicans who have already gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole and drunk the Trumpian Kool-Aid. Moreover, on key national issues, the far-right candidates the GOP has nominated are massively out of sync with public opinion. Lake, Finchem, Masters, all oppose abortion rights. Yet more than seven in 10 Arizonans believe in preserving reproductive freedoms. Eighty percen t of Arizonans want a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and for holders of Temporary Protected Status; on the subject of immigration, this puts them at loggerheads with all the leading GOP candidates. A large majority of Arizonans support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. A similarly large majority support a rapid transition to a clean energy economy. Again, the GOP opposes these changes. There is, in other words, a pathway-albeit narrow-for the Democrats to consolidate their political takeover of Arizona in this election season. The party has nominated eminently sensible politicians to fight key races. By contrast, the GOP has opted for extremism.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "Kari Lake and the Power of a Polished MAGA Message\n\nIn March, 2021, Kari Lake, who for twenty-two years had been the co-anchor of the 5 P.M. and 9 P.M. local news at Fox 10 Phoenix, recorded a two-and-a-half-minute goodbye of sorts, and posted it to social media. Lake had been off the set recently, having taken a personal leave, and she said that she wouldn't be coming back. \"Sadly, journalism has changed a lot since I first stepped into a newsroom,\" Lake said . \"And I'll be honest-I don't like the direction it's going.\" She went on, \"It is scary walking away from a good job and a successful career, especially in difficult times. I know God has my back and will guide me to work that aligns with my values.\"\n\nLake is now the Republican nominee in the race for governor of Arizona, and a very quickly rising figure within the national Party. The National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote in a column on Thursday that, if Lake wins her race, she \"would have to be considered the favorite to become Donald Trump's vice presidential pick should he win the Republican nomination again in 2024.\" She has done this without much of a traditional campaign operation. She has not commissioned a single poll, and according to Politico's Alex Isenstadt, when a supporter asked Lake whether she had hired certain high-priced consultants, the candidate said , \"I don't know who those people are.\" She then called over a young aide and told him to \"show off his ' MAGA ' tattoo,\" which he did by pulling back his lower lip. Lake's rise has been unsettling for reporters in particular, since she is bluntly antagonistic toward many of them. The Washington Post's Ruby Cramer, interviewing the candidate for a recent profile , found that Lake and her husband, an independent producer named Jeff Halperin, record their press encounters. (If it all \"goes great,\" Lake told Cramer, it needn't be cause for concern.) She taunts reporters about their audience size; the clips go viral.\n\nWhen Lake upended the Republican gubernatorial primary this year, she was seen largely as a MAGA candidate who had outflanked the field by insisting that Donald Trump was the true winner of the 2020 Presidential election. But, in the general election, that political strength on the far-right has been compounded by another: perhaps unsurprisingly, Lake is exceptionally good at TV. She speaks concisely and evocatively, and maintains emotional control even while saying very aggressive things. During a televised primary debate , she denounced Joe Biden 's border policies for yielding control \"to a criminal element, to dangerous drugs that are killing our young people, and he's taken away our ability to protect our own state.\" When Mark Phillips, a political reporter at the Phoenix ABC affiliate, played a clip of the retired general and Trump political associate Michael Flynn saying that states have the right to declare war and worriedly asked Lake if that's what she had in mind when she called for militarizing the border, Lake said , \"We're declaring an invasion and we're protecting our border. That's what we're gonna do. You can call it whatever you want.\" After the Dobbs decision , a legal battle in Arizona will either leave the state with its current fifteen-week ban or revert it to an 1864 law that banned all abortions in the state except when a mother's life is at risk. Lake has expressed support for both laws. \"I'm pro-woman,\" she told Phillips. \"And I want to make sure that women have health care. I want to make sure women have access to birth control. And I want to make sure that women are treated with respect.\" She went on, \"My stance is that I'm pro-life and I want to save as many babies as possible.\"\n\nJournalists and liberals have often been alarmed at the growth of right-wing media , which has been a fertile ground for conspiracy theories alleging that the 2020 election was stolen, or that the media is suppressing the truth about the harms of COVID vaccines, or (in the case of QAnon ) that the country's élites belong to a cabal. As Trump's Presidency has receded, the attention on far-right media has only sharpened, both because Republican political candidates have increasingly used fringe outlets to reach an audience and because reporters and liberals have learned to pay attention to what might be circulating there.\n\nBut that isn't what this election is about. The Republican momentum-and, as I write, it looks very real-is built on a small group of much simpler and less exotic stories: rising crime, chaos at the border, and pain at the pump, each of which has been a standby of local news for a generation. Lake is a talented politician, but less deft campaigners have leaned effectively on these themes, too. The Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin, a staunch Trump supporter who once nominated Jared Kushner for the Nobel Peace Prize, has in recent weeks mounted a serious challenge to Kathy Hochul in the New York governor's race-one poll last week had him down just four points-in part by following local crime stories with the assiduousness of a small-market TV reporter making an audition tape. On October 18th, Zeldin tweeted an ABC 7 segment of a small event he held outside of a Queens subway station, writing, \"I was in Jackson Heights in Queens earlier today outside another subway station where someone was pushed onto the subway tracks and killed.\"\n\nThere is a reason that the Republicans have seemed to dominate the news ever since Biden took office. These themes are vivid and naturally suited to television news, and they have evoked in their supporters a visceral reaction that Democrats have managed to achieve only on abortion. Otherwise, the Democrats have often relied on statistical information (of the underlying strength of the economy, of the efficacy of the COVID vaccine) to make their case, while Republicans have turned to televisual information to demonstrate the violence in the streets, the migrants running across the border, the soaring prices at the local gas station. (In the education wars that heated up in 2021, images of outraged conservative parents at school-board meetings were up against quotes from tenured academics thoughtfully explaining what critical race theory was and wasn't.) One of these information types is more powerful than the other. If it bleeds, it leads, in campaigns such as the 9 P.M. news.\n\nAt the beginning of these midterm elections , everyone in politics wanted to know whether Republicans were turning back toward Trump or away from him. This question overshadowed what turned out to be a more interesting development-and, for Democrats, a more ominous one. Certain rising Republican politicians-especially Lake and Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis (whose wife, Casey, is herself a former local TV-news anchor)-have managed to fuse a New Right pugnacity with a hyper-attention to the news cycle and their own media presentation. It is a potent political mix, and in the past two years it has meant that Republicans no longer look quite so frumpy, quite so clueless, or quite so chaotic as they usually seemed during the Trump years. They are onto something, and if it sometimes feels like the political news has spent the Biden Administration stuck in one long local television-news cycle, well, it probably will feel that way for a while longer.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA Lake expert tells Vox everything about her rise and what to expect after Election Day.\n\nby Vox Staff\n\nKari Lake - a former news anchor and current GOP gubernatorial candidate in Arizona - spent the year rising in the polls and is now virtually tied with her Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.\n\nLake, a political neophyte, quickly drew national attention for her combative style, anti-media rhetoric, and her devotion to former President Donald Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election.

There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts , Google Podcasts , Spotify , and Stitcher .\n\nTell me about Kari Lake.\n\nKari Lake is 53 years old. She is a mother of two, known here in Arizona for her career, for 22 years as a television news anchor here in Phoenix on Fox 10.\n\nThen, in March 2021, she published a video saying that she didn't believe in the journalism that she was doing anymore, that it wasn't accurately capturing Arizonans. And she publicly resigned her position.\n\nThree months later announces she's running for governor of Arizona. She gets former President Donald Trump's endorsement. It is undeniable that the two of them have a sort of special charisma. He speaks about her in very laudatory language. Along the campaign trail she has sort of had this say-anything style that I think really a lot of people identify as something that Trump sort of championed.\n\nOne of the things that makes Kari Lake so unique is she has turned on her former profession and done it frankly very well in a way that really speaks to voters. It's just one of the things that makes her such a fascinating candidate, frankly.\n\nAnother thing that makes her fascinating is the fact that Kari Lake was a registered Democrat once upon a time. She has said in the past she voted for Barack Obama's presidency because of his promise to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And then something obviously changed.\n\nThere is a perception out there that she has become conservative just in the campaign. I actually don't think that's true. If you look at her final few years at Fox 10, she was making some comments that generated headlines themselves. There was a big push in Arizona for public school funding. And she made a claim that it was actually like this covert operation to legalize marijuana, which it was not.\n\nKari Lake is probably [now] most widely known for her stance on the 2020 election. She has said she believed that Trump won Arizona, although he didn't.\n\nShe continues to make claims that election procedures here in Arizona were not followed, that ballots were received late or raising concerns about chain of custody problems that have all been debunked. Beyond elections, she has made some claims that have really turned some people off.\n\nShe was at an event where she sort of made light on the attack on Paul Pelosi . That was well-received by the crowd that she was in front of, but certainly has generated some controversy since then about just making light of a terrible attack.\n\nThis is how she gets a reputation of being the candidate who will say anything. And this has really made her distinctive, even in 2022 when it seems like anyone will say anything.\n\nIn August, she was at a rally here with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis . And both of them are certainly considered rising stars in Republican politics with potential future aspirations. But there was this moment where Kari was talking about his sort of style and she referenced this phrase, [saying, \"I'll tell you what he's got. I don't know if you've heard of this but he's got BDE. Anybody know what that means?\"]\n\nIt really is certainly not something I've ever heard said by a politician. And I mean, she hasn't said it since. So how it played, I think, that's telling.\n\nWhere is Kari Lake on the issues that people in Arizona really care about?\n\nWhen it comes to the economy, she has a plan to work with the legislature to prevent municipalities from charging grocery and rent taxes.\n\nShe is making border security the forefront of her campaign. Kari has said that she will secure the border. And in September, she was at an event talking about border cartels that traffic people and drugs and what she's going to do. And just directly quoted Donald Trump's controversial words. [\"They are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. And they are rapists. And that's who's coming across our border. That's a fact.\"]\n\n[She was] really casting all migrants in this broad negative light. She wants to use an unproven and potentially problematic legal idea of declaring an invasion at the border, to use state law enforcement resources as deportation officers.\n\nThe campaign is pitching this as the big idea that she is going to do to defend the state. Even if it means a lawsuit, it will at least test what else states can do as they portray the Biden administration just failing at the border.\n\nWhat is she saying to voters about voting itself?\n\nSo she frequently calls Joe Biden an illegitimate president.\n\nIn terms of actual policy, she has joined a court case to end early mail-in voting here in Arizona, which is how the vast majority of people cast their ballots. She's also filed a lawsuit to get rid of electronic vote tabulation machines, which would just slow down the process, be very challenging in terms of requiring a hand count of ballots.\n\nShe has shifted a little bit how she talks about the 2020 election. Now she really frames it as citizens just trying to ask questions about election procedures, which is just a sharp contrast to her own claims just ahead of the primary that she had detected stealing going on. She has refused to provide any evidence of that and has largely let that go in the last three or four months.\n\nOn abortion, she has supported a very restrictive law that's on Arizona's books that bans abortions in almost every circumstance unless a woman's life is in jeopardy and levies prison time against any doctors that provide abortions outside of those circumstances. More recently, she's also expressed an openness to another law that is on the books here in Arizona that bans abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nThe latest way that she's talking about this is she will follow the law, whatever it is. And we're waiting for courts to decide which is the prevailing law that Arizonans should follow.\n\nHave you interviewed Kari Lake?\n\nYes. Once.\n\nShe agreed to sit down with me once before the primary for about 20 minutes to talk about her border security plan. One of the unexpected things about interviewing Kari Lake is any time you talk to her or you interview her, you are also on camera.\n\nHer husband is her cameraman. They have this full operation - multiple cameras, the big boom mic above your head - that's listening to everything.\n\nAnd the campaign will publish those videos.\n\nSo you've gone from being a print reporter to a television reporter overnight.\n\nYeah, I really was not prepared for that. But here we are.\n\nIn 2020, the state went very narrowly for Joe Biden. Without asking you to prognosticate too much, do the polls show this race breaking red or breaking blue?\n\nIt's pretty tied. The latest poll I saw was a New York Times Siena College poll that put it exactly even. Certainly, it appears that Kari Lake has some momentum over these last couple of weeks that she is gaining ground, which I think matches what we've seen for the Republican momentum generally this cycle. But it's a pretty even race.\n\nWill Kari Lake concede if she loses? What has she said?\n\nShe went on CNN a couple of weeks ago and was asked multiple times if she would concede if she loses. She refused to say that she would do so.\n\nMore recently than that, in another interview, she said she would accept the results of the election, [but] neither of [her responses were] direct confirmations that, yes, she would concede if she loses. I think if you rewind and look back to the primary, about a week before that election, it was another very, very close race. And we heard Kari Lake claim stealing was going on without evidence. She has not provided any.\n\nPerhaps those claims from the primary are a signal of what's to come.\n\nWhat I hear you saying is Arizona has a remarkably charismatic candidate who knows how to talk to voters, who knows how to use the press, who knows how to get the attention of Donald Trump. If she loses, it doesn't sound like we've necessarily seen or heard the last of Kari Lake.\n\nYou're totally right. She's been floated as a potential vice presidential pick for Donald Trump.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Republican candidate for governor is still refusing to concede the race that made her a MAGA star.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nKari Lake, the defeated Republican nominee for Arizona governor who was the most prominent 2022 candidate running on former President Donald Trump's 2020 election lies, still refuses to concede a race the Associated Press called for her opponent weeks ago.\n\nMost other election-denier candidates , who lost up and down the ballot and across the country in 2022, have conceded their races with little fanfare. But Lake is an almost singular voice calling her state's contests one of the \"most dishonest elections in the history of Arizona\" in a video posted on Trump's social media network Truth Social on Monday.\n\n\"This botched election should not be certified,\" she added.\n\nMonday was the county-level deadline to certify the results. All did, with the exception of Cochise County, where the Republican majority on the Board of Supervisors delayed certification until Friday, citing concerns about voting machines. Current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, the Democrat who won the gubernatorial race, consequently sued the county , arguing that its decision could \"potentially disenfranchise\" some 47,000 voters.\n\nThe AP called the race on November 14, and the results weren't within the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount. In the now complete vote count, Hobbs won the gubernatorial election by 17,116 votes.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Lake from questioning the results . She has boosted accounts from supporters who claim they had trouble voting, argued that Hobbs cannot certify her own election as governor due to conflicts of interest, and filed a lawsuit asking Maricopa County, the largest county in Arizona, to hand over various election records before the statewide canvass of the results, which is scheduled to happen on December 5.\n\nThose documents include ones that could help identify people who may have not been able to cast a ballot, including those who checked in at more than one polling location or who submitted a mail ballot and sought to vote in person. Lake also is seeking details on counted and uncounted ballots that were mistakenly mixed. It's unlikely that these ballots affected the results - mixing up counted and uncounted ballots is a routine problem in elections that county officials have confirmed happened at a few vote centers this year, but that they can rectify.\n\nLake is getting help in her quest from Trump, who posted on Truth Social Monday that Lake \"should be installed as governor of Arizona\" and baselessly claimed that she was the victim of a \"criminal voting operation\" involving broken voting machines in Republican districts, drawing a parallel to his false claims about his own 2020 loss. Lake became a key Trump ally during her campaign, and she has been floated as a potential 2024 running mate for Trump, who announced his candidacy just weeks ago.\n\n\"This is almost as bad as the 2020 Presidential Election, which the Unselect Committee refuses to touch because they know it was Fraudulent!\" he wrote.\n\nAs to whether she's planning on abandoning her claims anytime soon, Lake seemed to suggest she won't. She wrote Monday that \"the Fake News ignores our Fake Elections and expects us to just 'move on.' We won't.\"\n\nIt was obvious well before Election Day that Lake intended to challenge the results if she lost.\n\nAhead of Election Day, Lake repeatedly dodged questions about whether she would concede the governor's race if she lost, saying, \"I'm going to win the election, and I will accept that result,\" and that she'd only accept a \"fair, honest and transparent\" result. During the primary, she said she would challenge the results if she lost because it would have indicated \" there's some cheating going on .\" And before the race was called, she suggested that Arizona election officials were intentionally dragging their feet on releasing the results while still declaring, \" I am 100% going to win .\"\n\nHer comments were in line with her history of election denialism. Lake has said that, had she been governor at the time, she wouldn't have certified the 2020 vote for Biden, saying that it was \" Corrupt, Rotten & Rigged .\" She even filed a lawsuit, which has since been dismissed by a federal judge, that made false claims about issues with vote-counting machines, and sought to require Arizona officials to tabulate 2022 ballots by hand.\n\nOther election-denying candidates, such as the Arizona GOP's secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem , similarly set up the expectation that they would challenge the election results. Almost all of them ended up losing. Abraham Hamadeh, the GOP nominee for Arizona attorney general, has argued that the election was \"afflicted with certain errors and inaccuracies,\" but his race is heading to a recount. Finchem has also yet to concede, arguing as recently as Monday that the election should be recalled and that there should be a \" new election .\"\n\nThe Arizona governor's race made Lake a GOP star . It's possible that her attempts to prolong the certification of the election in Arizona are just a ploy to maintain her national profile and create a launching pad for the next phase of her career, political or otherwise.\n\nShe ran an unconventional campaign, eschewing traditional ad buys for viral campaign videos full of controversial statements that grabbed national headlines, including comments that appeared to make light of the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. All of that won her Trump's admiration (and endorsement) and praise from other prominent Republicans , though she still proved a divisive figure within the party and might be even more so now that she's lost what seemed to be a winnable race.\n\nKenneth L. Khachigian, Ronald Reagan's former chief speechwriter, waxed poetic in the Wall Street Journal last month: \"What makes Ms. Lake's message different is its simplicity and fearlessness. It's unapologetic and sincere, not clothed in code words.\" Trump reportedly sees something of himself in Lake. Even the current term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey, who accused Lake of \" misleading voters \" when he was backing Taylor Robson during the primary, eventually warmed to her , though he hasn't entertained her refusal to concede and called Hobbs to offer his congratulations.\n\nAll the adulation from Republicans - and speculation that she might be a potential running mate for Trump, even though she didn't win the governorship - suggests a future in the GOP. By keeping her supporters, and Trump's, engaged, she puts herself in a strong position to help Trump mount a tough challenge to Biden come 2024, and to attempt to fulfill any other political aspirations, whatever they may be.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nCanary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Lake has said that, had she been governor at the time, she wouldn't have certified the 2020 vote for Biden, saying that it was \" Corrupt, Rotten & Rigged .\" She even filed a lawsuit, which has since been dismissed by a federal judge, that made false claims about issues with vote-counting machines, and sought to require Arizona officials to tabulate 2022 ballots by hand.\n\nOther election-denying candidates, such as the Arizona GOP's secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem , similarly set up the expectation that they would challenge the election results. Almost all of them ended up losing. Abraham Hamadeh, the GOP nominee for Arizona attorney general, has argued that the election was \"afflicted with certain errors and inaccuracies,\" but his race is heading to a recount. Finchem has also yet to concede, arguing as recently as Monday that the election should be recalled and that there should be a \" new election .\"\n\nThe Arizona governor's race made Lake a GOP star . It's possible that her attempts to prolong the certification of the election in Arizona are just a ploy to maintain her national profile and create a launching pad for the next phase of her career, political or otherwise.\n\nShe ran an unconventional campaign, eschewing traditional ad buys for viral campaign videos full of controversial statements that grabbed national headlines, including comments that appeared to make light of the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Republican candidate for Arizona governor has suffered another defeat - this time in court.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nMore than a month after the Associated Press called the results, Republican Kari Lake is still trying to challenge her loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs in the 2022 Arizona governor's race.\n\nThough she ultimately lost by more than 17,000 votes, Lake has refused to concede, accused Arizona election officials of misconduct, and sought a court declaration that she won the governor's race or an entire do-over of the election.\n\nOn Saturday, a state court dismissed Lake's lawsuit after a two-day trial in which she sought to prove that there was a deliberate scheme to sabotage her. She said she plans to appeal the ruling and continues to contend that \"our elections are run outside of the law.\" But even if her appeal fails, Lake has still gotten a chance to air her grievances yet again in a way that could help advance her once-ascendant career in GOP politics.\n\nLake has contended in legal filings that she only lost because \"hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots infected the election in Maricopa County\" and that there were \"widespread tabulator or printer failures\" that stemmed from election officials' misconduct.\n\n\"This case is about restoring trust in the election process - a trust that Maricopa County election officials and Hobbs have shattered,\" Lake wrote in her December 9 complaint before the Arizona Superior Court.\n\nBut as Judge Peter Thompson wrote in his decision Saturday, there isn't currently any evidence to support Lake's claims. \"This Court acknowledges the anger and frustration of voters who were subjected to inconvenience and confusion at voter centers as technical problems arose during the 2022 General Election,\" the decision says. \"But this Court's duty is not solely to incline an ear to public outcry.\"\n\nThere were widespread printer malfunctions in Maricopa County on Election Day: At about a third of the county's polling places, ballots were printed with ink that was too faint to be processed by vote-counting machines that then rejected them. It's not clear how many ballots were affected.\n\nBut county officials have said that the problems did not prevent anyone from voting, and a Washington Post analysis found that Republican ballots weren't any more likely to be affected by those problems. And the county ballot contractor has said it complied with applicable law and its own policies.\n\nMaricopa County and Hobbs, in her capacity as governor-elect and as the current secretary of state, had asked the court to dismiss Lake's complaint. They argued that it was full of \"unwarranted speculation,\" failing to \"show even a single illegal vote, any erroneous count of votes, or that the [election officials] engaged in any misconduct in the administration of the election.\"\n\nThompson had allowed Lake to proceed to trial on two counts. For one, she had the opportunity to prove that election officials intentionally tampered with ballot-on-demand printers, which print out dedicated ballots when each voter checks in, with the aim of swaying the election and ultimately did change the outcome. Lake also had the chance to prove that Maricopa County's ballot contractor intentionally and improperly added votes from their family members to the total and that it materially impacted the result.\n\nFor Lake, the opportunity to go to trial was what she called a \" massive Legal WIN !\"\n\n\"Christmas came early yesterday,\" she told the crowd at an event hosted by the right-wing activist organization Turning Point USA earlier this month. \"We have a chance to show the world that our elections are truly corrupt and we won't take it anymore.\"\n\nNow she's facing the prospect of monetary sanctions for making frivolous claims. But even though she has't succeeded in her legal fight so far, she has been able to use it to maintain her national profile. Though election deniers lost up and down the ballot in 2022, their movement is still very much alive, and Lake is at its helm.\n\nThe Arizona governor's race made Lake a GOP star . Her attempts to fight the results have allowed her to maintain her national profile, even though the election is over. She has continued to be the subject of national headlines, and she was among the featured speakers at Turning Point USA's America Fest convention, alongside the likes of Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and Trump-world figures including Steve Bannon and Donald Trump Jr. And her legal battle could eventually serve as a launching pad for the next phase of her career, political or otherwise.\n\nShe ran an unconventional campaign, eschewing traditional ad buys for viral campaign videos full of controversial statements that grabbed national headlines, including comments that appeared to make light of the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. All of that won her Trump's admiration (and endorsement) and praise from other prominent Republicans , though she still proved a divisive figure within the party and might be even more so now that she's lost what seemed to be a winnable race.\n\nKenneth L.

By keeping her supporters, and Trump's, engaged, she puts herself in a strong position to help Trump mount a tough challenge to Biden come 2024, and to attempt to fulfill any other political aspirations, whatever they may be.\n\nUpdate, December 27, 11 am ET: This story was originally published on December 20 and has been updated to reflect the Arizona Superior Court's ruling dismissing Lake's lawsuit.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTrump-endorsed Kari Lake is in a tight primary in Arizona that has been mostly about relitigating 2020.\n\nby Natalie Jennings\n\nThere seem to be an endless number of Republican primary races in Arizona that all hinge on two things: The legitimacy of the 2020 election, which was challenged more dramatically in Arizona than any other state, and fealty to Donald Trump.\n\nState House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who testified to the January 6 committee about pressure he faced from Trump associates to unwind the 2020 election, has a serious primary challenge. The race to challenge Sen. Mark Kelly (D) features five Republicans - including state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, whom Trump supporters are still hounding to challenge election matters, and the Trump-backed election denier Blake Masters.\n\nAnd Kari Lake and Mark Finchem have made Trump's election lies a centerpiece of their campaigns for governor and secretary of state, respectively, the two offices that have the most direct influence on elections. They've formed something like an unofficial ticket, which has gotten a hearty boost from Trump himself.\n\nLake's chief GOP primary opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson, has used an influx of her own money and endorsements from more establishment GOP figures like Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence to make the race competitive in the home stretch. Finchem has three challengers, including some who aren't election deniers, but he remains the frontrunner for the GOP nomination.\n\nTo understand how those races are shaping up - and what's at stake in them - I spoke to two Arizona Republic reporters: Mary Jo Pitzl is a senior reporter covering the secretary of state's race, and Stacey Barchenger is a state politics reporter focused on the gubernatorial election. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLooking from the outside, it seems like what happened in Arizona in 2020 and the aftermath of it - particularly the Maricopa County ballot review sanctioned by the state Senate - is still at the heart of these races. Am I missing anything?\n\n2022 is about three-quarters about 2020. We are still relitigating the 2020 election in the campaigns and we've got some legal actions moving. Candidates Lake and Finchem are in federal court trying to ban the use of any kind of electronic machines in election tabulation. It's all carryover from 2020.\n\nCould you two give me an overview of the primaries? Let's start with the GOP governor's race.\n\nSo there are four candidates still in the race, and there are two tiers. Lake's a former television news anchor for the Fox affiliate here in Phoenix. She was there for 22 years. Early last year, she renounced journalism. She said she didn't believe in it anymore. A couple of months later, [she] announced she was running for governor. I think Trump and Lake have a chemistry unlike what I've seen between him and other candidates in other states. She has the sort of populist appeal that I think he had, and really used to speak to voters.\n\nAlso in the top tier, you have Taylor Robson, who comes from a political family. She has not run for statewide office before. Her career is in law and development and the real estate world. She was on the board of regents, which oversees our three public universities in Arizona. She recently has been gathering endorsements and support from traditional Republicans. Mike Pence and Donald Trump held rallies last Friday in Arizona - dueling rallies that were very much seen as competing for the future of Arizona and the future of the state Republican Party.\n\nWhen I first got here last year, political analysts said that this was Lake's race to lose. She was so far ahead. But that is not the case anymore. Taylor Robson has narrowed the gap. I think it's within reach for either of them, which has made the last couple of weeks so contentious.\n\nWhat about the secretary of state race?\n\nOn the Republican side, for secretary of state we've got four candidates. The most prominent is Finchem. He's currently a state lawmaker. He was the first Trump-endorsed candidate in Arizona this cycle. He was present near the Capitol on January 6. He was out there to give a speech, he said, at one of the rallies. That didn't happen because of scheduling problems, but he did join the crowd that marched to the Capitol. He says he did not go inside. He has been subpoenaed for some of his records involving that.\n\nHe has been a very loud and consistent election denier, maintaining that Trump lost the election, that he was cheated out of it. He helped host two different forums in Arizona, supposedly bringing forward evidence of problems with the 2020 election. He has made it very clear that if he sees a scintilla of impropriety in the upcoming elections, he will demand a hand recount. He is a big proponent of no machines, and thinks that all votes should be cast on a ballot in person on Election Day, and hand-tabulated.\n\nAlso running is state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who sponsored [an election reform bill after 2020] widening the margin that was needed to demand a recount to 0.5 percent. [State Rep. Shawnna] Bolick, another state lawmaker and candidate, also introduced election-related bills that would allow the legislature to reject the electors chosen by the voters and have the legislature replace them with electors of their own choosing. That legislation didn't even get a hearing, but it got a lot of attention.\n\nLastly, we have the outsider candidate, advertising executive Beau Lane. He has drawn the support of the Republican establishment. Ducey endorsed him late in the cycle. He's pulled in lots of money - almost as much as Finchem. We're talking above the $1 million mark, which is unheard of for secretary of state races. He is seen as the biggest threat to Finchem for the Republican nomination.\n\nCan you tell me exactly what the state secretary of state's role is in Arizona's elections?\n\nThe thing that's most relevant is that the secretary of state is charged with certifying the election results, which [current secretary of state and Democratic gubernatorial candidate] Katie Hobbs did in late 2020. I might add that she did it in an undisclosed location because of all the threats that were out there.\n\nFinchem, the leading Republican candidate, has indicated that he would not automatically certify the results. ... Bolick has also said she would not immediately rush to certify the results, even though the law says you've got to do it.\n\nElections are run by the 16 county recorders. The secretary of state has a coordinating role, and can certainly have a lot to do with certifying the accuracy of the machines that are used to tabulate votes, and set out the procedures by which elections are conducted through the elections procedure manual, which has been another big fight that is extending into the courts.\n\nAnd what is the governor's role in the election process?\n\nThe governor is involved in the certification process and signs off on the results.\n\nIf you recall back to 2020, Gov. Doug Ducey was in a ceremony to certify Joe Biden's win in Arizona when his cellphone goes off and it's \"Hail to the Chief.\" That was his ringtone for Donald Trump. He silenced the call, forever putting himself in Trump's bad graces.\n\nI would add that especially the governor, but also the secretary of state - they have big bully pulpits to talk about these things. Some of our candidates, I have no doubt, would use that bully pulpit to maximum effectiveness.\n\nWhat is the market in Arizona for a less extreme Republican candidate? Is there enough of one that any of these candidates who aren't Trump-aligned could win in a Republican primary?\n\nYou do have your conservative, traditional Republicans, many of whom are women, who aren't going to go for the real far-right candidates. In the secretary of state's race, where there are four candidates, it could split the votes. Finchem is probably going to have that very strong Trump base, and that's basically all he needs to win.\n\nI think this race is one of the first clear tests we'll have of which faction of the Republican Party dominates in Arizona. It comes after 2020, and after our ballot review, which was expensive and kept Arizona in the national headlines for so long. There is a segment of the Republican Party that is tired of that. With Taylor Robson being very willing to campaign hard and spend so much of her own money, it puts within reach and gives us a chance to see if a more traditional Republican can win.\n\nDucey has weighed in and endorsed Lane and Taylor Robson. But does he maintain much influence with the Republicans who are going to be voting next week?\n\nDucey is complicated. His endorsement risks alienating any Trump supporters since the former president has taken multiple shots at Ducey. They're not friends anymore. Then again, Lake has locked down the Trump base in Arizona, so I'm not so sure that Ducey really had much room to alienate anybody.\n\nHe certainly is still very powerful, nationally, through his chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association. He's very well liked in the business community, so his endorsement certainly tells that community where they should land.\n\nSo the election issue is going to certainly animate part of the Republican base. How do you feel like that is going to play in a general election? Are Arizona voters going to be really put off by a candidate who won on election denialism, or are other things going to be front of mind?\n\nOne of the unique things about Arizona is about a third of our registered voters are independents. They are who you need in the general to win. And they have handed victories to Doug Ducey, and they've handed victories to Mark Kelly, Kyrsten Sinema, and Joe Biden.\n\nThe general election is going to involve some references to 2020, but it's to be determined how much. People are really worried about inflation. Phoenix has crazy-high housing prices, and inflation is worse here than in a lot of other places. I suspect we'll see candidates in the general talk more about that than 2020. This answer comes with a huge caveat that it depends who the nominee on the Republican side is.\n\nWhen it comes to the general, we're likely to have a couple of initiatives on the ballot that could draw out more centrist and left-leaning voters, such as a ban on dark money and a whole raft of election reform measures.\n\nFor the secretary of state's race, it's all going to be played up as a fight to preserve democracy. Do you want to have the election denier and Mark Finchem assuming he wins? On the Democratic side, they will be fierce advocates for protecting the way we have been running elections.\n\nI see Democrats are now weighing in as they have in other races , spending with ads meant to boost Lake , pointing out her extremism. They'd rather run against her than Taylor Robson.\n\nThey think Lake might be easier to beat because she has so closely adhered to the false claims of election fraud. If Lake is the nominee and Hobbs, the current secretary of state, is the Democratic nominee, our general is probably going to focus pretty heavily on 2020 because you have the chief defender and the chief denier in Arizona going head-to-head.\n\nWhat about in the Senate primary? Are the dynamics any different than in these races?\n\nI mean, there's no Democratic challenger to Mark Kelly. He's raising a ton and spending a ton already. The GOP side is more interesting. Our current attorney general, Brnovich, also has some bad blood with Donald Trump, but he was at one point seen as a frontrunner. But recently, the talk has really focused on Blake Masters. He got Trump's endorsement and has basked in that glow. With Trump weighing in on so many of our races here in the primary, that's really the storyline that we are watching on Election Day: How powerful is his grip on Arizona Republican voters, still?\n\nThere are five Republicans in that race. So it doesn't take a big percentage of the vote to win.\n\nWhat else should we be focused on as we watch next Tuesday?\n\nThere's a really tight race for secretary of state on the Democratic side; there's more happening publicly on that than on the Republican side.\n\nDemocrats have a former Maricopa County recorder, Adrian Fontes, who is in charge of elections there, running against a state lawmaker, Reginald Bolding, who is the leader of the Democrats in the House. The race has recently gotten a lot more attention because Bolding is associated with a number of nonprofits, one of which is putting a lot of money, like close to $1 million, into his campaign. That raises questions about conflict of interest and violations of some campaign election laws because it involves dark money.\n\nBolding says, look, I've put up a firewall, I'm not involved with the decisions that my PAC makes. But all of their money is flowing into his campaign, and the Fontes campaign is trying to capitalize off of that. The few polls that I've seen are mixed. Some internal polling shows that the two candidates are pretty close.\n\nDoes baggage like that present an opportunity for the Republican nominee, even if it's Finchem?\n\nIf the Democratic secretary of state nominee has a cloud of suspicion surrounding him - there were complaints filed with state offices, the FEC, and the IRS - it would certainly give Finchem a lot to attack with. That said, if Adrian Fontes wins, he has a less-than-pristine record, but it doesn't involve ongoing administrative complaints.\n\nI don't know that a wounded Democratic nominee would drive voters to Finchem's column. More likely, it could dampen enthusiasm and voters might take a pass on the secretary of state race.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWe probably haven't seen the last of this 2020 election denier.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nRepublican Kari Lake, a far-right former TV news anchor who rapidly built a national profile as one of the most vocal proponents of President Donald Trump's 2020 election lies, won't be Arizona's next governor. But even if she admits that fact - a big if, given that she still hasn't conceded and continues to attack her state's electoral process - it's not likely to be the last we'll see of her.\n\nThe Arizona governor's race has made Lake a GOP star . She's been outspoken about her extreme views on election security, abortion, and immigration. She ran an unconventional campaign, eschewing traditional ad buys for viral campaign videos, full of controversial statements that grabbed national headlines, including comments that appeared to make light of the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. All of that won her Trump's admiration (and endorsement) and praise from other prominent Republicans . She's even been floated as a potential running mate for Trump in 2024.\n\nHer initial response to her loss, which was called by the Associated Press on Monday, certainly echoed Trump's bombastic rhetoric: \"Arizonans know BS when they see it,\" she tweeted .\n\nHer campaign has reportedly been debating whether to officially challenge the results; her advisers are urging her not to \" storm the castle ,\" according to the Washington Post. But in a video posted Thursday morning, she showed no sign of backing down.\n\n\"Rest assured, I have assembled the best and brightest legal team, and we are exploring every avenue to correct the many wrongs that have been done this past week,\" Lake said. \"I'm doing everything in my power to right these wrongs.\"\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, Lake was still trailing her Democratic opponent, current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, by more than half a percentage point, the threshold that would trigger a recount. A recount isn't likely to overcome Hobbs's roughly 17,000-vote lead, but Lake could use it as rationale to further delay conceding the election, which she called \" botched \" in a Fox News interview on Monday.\n\nThe race appeared close until the end, with polls showing Lake and Hobbs in a dead heat before Election Day. It took days for the results to be called, and Hobbs's victory came down to the margins she was able to drive up in big urban centers in Pima and Maricopa counties.\n\nIt's a big loss for Republicans in this key battleground where President Joe Biden won by a little over 10,000 votes in 2020 and another blow to Trump's reputation as a kingmaker after his handpicked candidates had a poor showing across the country this year. It's also a key win for Democrats, who simultaneously picked up a governorship and fended off the rise of another far-right election denier.\n\nBut this might only be the beginning of Lake's political career - and that's a worrying prospect for Democrats who have seen how formidable she's been, even as a political newcomer.\n\nLake's views on the 2020 election are especially dangerous in a place like Arizona, where Biden's margin was incredibly thin and where the state legislature, which might remain under Republican control, could soon be empowered by an upcoming US Supreme Court ruling to undermine the results of future elections.\n\nLake has said she wouldn't have certified the 2020 vote for Biden, saying that it was \" corrupt, rotten .\" She even filed a lawsuit, which has since been dismissed by a federal judge, that made false claims about issues with vote-counting machines and sought to require Arizona officials to tabulate 2022 ballots by hand.\n\nUnlike Lake, most Arizonans are confident in the state's elections: A Center for the Future of Arizona/HighGround Public Affairs poll released in October found that 70 percent of likely voters in Arizona believed the state's elections were secure and 77 percent believed the 2022 results would be accurate.\n\nAhead of Election Day, Lake also repeatedly dodged questions about whether she would concede the governor's race if she lost, saying that \"I'm going to win the election, and I will accept that result,\" and that she'd only accept a \"fair, honest and transparent\" result. During the primary, she even preempted her own win by saying that she would challenge the results if she lost because it would have indicated \" there's some cheating going on .\" And before the race was called, she suggested that Arizona election officials were intentionally dragging their feet on releasing the results while still declaring, \" I am 100% going to win .\"\n\nHer supporters didn't immediately appear to be ready to move on either. Trump posted on his social network Truth Social that \"they just took the election away from Kari Lake.\" In a broadcast on Monday night, far-right commentator Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, discussed the possibility of recalling Hobbs as governor.\n\nHad Lake won, her election denialism could have been disastrous in the governor's office: She would have had a role to play in the certification of presidential election results and could have sought to use her office to delay or undermine the certification if she disagrees with the result.\n\nHobbs, on the other hand, rose to national prominence after defending the integrity of the 2020 election results in Arizona against Trump's efforts to overturn them, calling a Republican-led audit of the results a means of \" chasing conspiracy theories .\" She refused to even debate Lake because, as she told CNN , she \"didn't want to give her a bigger stage\" to spread her lies about the 2020 election.\n\nLake's views on abortion have also put her to the right of many Arizonans.\n\nLake supports existing extreme restrictions on abortion in Arizona. That includes legislation passed earlier this year by Arizona's GOP-controlled state legislature that banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. The state also has a 121-year-old total abortion ban on the books, which only has an exception for when the life of the pregnant person is in jeopardy. It went into effect immediately after the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade .\n\nLake has supported the 15-week ban and the pre- Roe ban, which she has called \" a great law that's already on the books .\" She has also called abortion \" the ultimate sin ,\" said abortion pills should be illegal, and said she would support banning abortion around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nHer positions seem to be out of sync with the Arizona electorate: A September OH Predictive insights poll found that 9 in 10 voters agree that abortion should be legal in at least some cases. That seems to be more in line with Hobbs's calls to both overturn the pre- Roe ban and the 15-week ban.\n\nLake entered politics after retiring from journalism because she didn't \"like the direction that it's going,\" as she said in a video announcing her resignation from local TV news. Other than covering local and national races for 22 years as a news anchor in Phoenix, she didn't have any prior experience in politics or government, which is unusual for gubernatorial candidates .\n\nDemocrats initially appeared to write off Lake as a fringe candidate. They even published a press release highlighting her primary opponent Karrin Taylor Robson's past donations to Democrats, which made Lake look like the true conservative in the race and more appealing to GOP primary voters. As in other parts of the country, Democrats appeared to assume that the far-right Lake would be easier to beat in the general election.\n\nBut Lake had the backing of Trump, whose endorsement appeared to still carry weight in Republican-leaning Arizona. And she also had something that other 2022 far-right candidates, such as Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, didn't have: more than two decades of experience on air for a Fox affiliate. That resume made her perpetually camera-ready and adept at speaking to voters' concerns in a way that many saw as authentic and even reminiscent of Trump's rhetorical style.\n\n\"I don't need a pollster or a consultant from DC or another big city to come into Arizona and tell me what Arizona is about,\" Lake told Politico .\n\nThat attitude was reflected in her campaign strategy. Rather than buying TV ads, she had her husband, a former videographer at NBC's Phoenix affiliate and freelance producer, film her sparring with reporters during interviews and posting the footage online, often with viral results.\n\nProminent Republicans are starstruck by her. Kenneth L. Khachigian, Ronald Reagan's former chief speechwriter, waxed poetic in the Wall Street Journal last month: \"What makes Ms. Lake's message different is its simplicity and fearlessness. It's unapologetic and sincere, not clothed in code words.\" Trump reportedly sees something of himself in Lake. Even the current term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey, who accused Lake of \" misleading voters \" when he was backing Taylor Robson during the primary, has recently warmed to her , though he hasn't entertained her refusal to concede and called Hobbs on Monday to offer his congratulations.\n\nAll the praise from Republicans - and speculation that she might be a potential running mate for Trump, even though she didn't win the governorship - has Democrats worried. Despite her loss, they think she has presidential charisma , and her media savvy and temperament could help Trump mount a tough challenge to President Joe Biden come 2024.\n\nUpdate, November 17, 2 pm ET: This story, originally published on November 14, has been updated multiple times, most recently with more information on Lake's refusal to concede.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "The silencing of Voice of America\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow the shuttering of a small US-funded news outlet explains Trump's governing philosophy.\n\nby Sean Collins and Gabrielle Berbey\n\nThe Trump administration has shuttered a number of federal agencies, and ordered another tranche closed last Friday .\n\nAmong them was Voice of America - a news outlet founded to help the Allies fight the Nazis that still publishes and broadcasts today. Or did, until Saturday, when its employees found themselves unable to go to work .\n\nThe media remarked on the loss of Voice of America , but it didn't quite cause the stir that firings at USAID or the Department of Education did , and that's perhaps because it does not broadcast inside the US. Americans can visit its website for news, but can't hear it on the radio or see it on television.\n\nHowever, as Gabrielle Berbey - who, along with her colleagues at Today, Explained reported on the death of Voice of America - explains, the outlet's shuttering provides a helpful way to understand the Trump administration's approach to governance. I spoke with Gabrielle about this, and more - our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nWhat is Voice of America? Why is it important?\n\nVoice of America is the largest and oldest US international broadcaster; it was established in 1942 to fight Nazi propaganda via shortwave radio. By the time World War II ended, Voice of America - or VOA - had 3,200 programs around the world in 40 languages.\n\nIt's operated since then, with a mission to continue combating authoritarian propaganda and to spread US values throughout the world. Today, it's a part of United States Agency for Global Media , or USAGM, which also includes other US media you may be familiar with, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and Radio Martí. And though most USAGM outlets started on the radio, today they broadcast on television and publish online as well.\n\nUSAGM has offices and journalists all around the world, reporting from and for places that otherwise might not have access to media beyond state-sponsored media, or that may not have much media infrastructure at all, places like China, Iran, and Afghanistan. And in many places, USAGM outlets are the main - and sometimes only - voice combating the state-sponsored media narrative.\n\nInterestingly, VOA does not actually broadcast in the US, which is why I think many people, especially people who are younger, don't know what VOA is. But it's played an important role for the past 80 years and this is the first time it's gone radio silent.\n\nWhy did it go radio silent?\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration issued an executive order that essentially put the employees of several agencies on administrative leave. As a result of that order , everyone who works at VOA and Radio Martí were put on administrative leave, and outlets like Radio Free Europe lost funding. And that effectively shut those outlets down.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nWhy did Trump do that?\n\nThe Trump administration was very critical of USAGM and a Voice of America even in its first term.\n\nThis term, Trump selected Kari Lake - who was the former, failed GOP gubernatorial and Senate candidate for Arizona, a fierce Trump loyalist, and former media professional herself - to run Voice of America and serve as a special adviser to USGM.\n\nShe went in reportedly really wanting to lead VOA , and to enact sweeping reforms to the organization. That wasn't necessarily seen as a bad thing. Some sources I spoke to for this story - even some former VOA journalists - said there's valid criticism that the VOA produces US propaganda, and some questioned whether essentially combating propaganda with propaganda, was the right use of US soft power. So there was some openness to changes.\n\nBut there were also concerns. A VOA journalist - Steve Herman, who was the White House bureau chief - was put on leave, and another involuntarily reassigned . So the reforms seemed like they might be drastic, but I don't know if people expected a complete shutdown.\n\nFor a time, it seemed like there might be a divide in the Trump administration. On one side, Trump adviser Elon Musk and special UN envoy Richard Grenell were tweeting how we don't need Voice of America anymore, and how it should be shut down. And on the other side was Lake, who responded to these tweets by defending USAGM and arguing that there was a place for Voice of America.\n\nIn the end, Lake backed the decision to shutter the outlets - the termination notices of some of the grants had her signature - even if she previously said that she was interested in saving it.\n\nThere's probably a mix of reasons why USAGM and VOA were targeted. One, the Trump administration is trying to make sweeping cuts through federal agencies, and we've seen agencies like the Department of Education and USAID targeted that don't align, or supposedly don't align, with the administration's worldview. And you could put USAGM in that category - it has been criticized by Trump-aligned figures as putting out \"fake news.\" There could also be a foreign policy element to it as well; we've seen Trump try to make some big resets on that front.\n\nSome of the US's adversaries have cheered the demise of USAGM, right? Has that changed the Trump administration's stance at all?\n\nI don't know that we've seen many minds being changed in the Trump administration, but yes, we have seen the Kremlin and Russian propaganda rejoicing that Trump had gutted Radio Free Asia, Radio Liberty, and Voice of America. Chinese state media called Voice of America a \"dirty rag\" that the Trump administration was getting rid of.\n\nThat response reflects the fact that USAGM outlets really were a way for the United States to insert its narrative into those countries, often in a way that was critical, or designed to make people question, the state-sponsored narrative.\n\nWithout these outlets, the US has lost a way to combat disinformation. And some people are losing access to news.\n\nI talked to one former VOA journalist during my reporting who remembered listening to VOA from Poland in the 1960s when he was a kid. He said that he would get American music and American news on VOA and that it would be his only source of information from the outside world. And that's still the case for some people, even today - USAGM reached some consumers in poorer and more rural areas that lack media infrastructure altogether; this was their source of news.\n\nBroadly, what can we learn about the Trump administration from these cuts?\n\nThe Trump administration is really looking for ways to make long-held far-right beliefs policy.\n\nWith VOA and USAGM, there's a cultural element, where there's this culture war against the so-called \"mainstream media.\" USAGM's outlets are a part of that media, and while the Trump administration can only do so much to independent outlets it doesn't like - like restricting White House access - it can shut down VOA.\n\nBut that's just one piece of a larger puzzle. There's the push for government efficiency and cutting waste that we talked about a little before - and it's easy to see things you don't like (aka \"fake news\") as waste to cut.\n\nAnd there's also a big foreign policy realignment happening. There's this idea of America First - that we need to pull back on the world stage and focus on the homefront, that taxpayer money shouldn't go to other countries, it should only be used domestically. We saw that with shutting down USAID, and we see that here.\n\nSo this is really emblematic of the larger vision for the realignment of the government the Trump administration seems to have.\n\nThis piece originally ran in the Today, Explained newsletter.

      "text": "Kyrsten Sinema made Arizona's next Senate race even more chaotic\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThree key questions to consider for 2024's Senate contest.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nKyrsten Sinema, the country's newest independent senator, didn't exactly surprise Washington when she announced earlier this month that she was leaving the Democratic Party. Arizona's senior senator has had a long streak of bucking her old party's line, frustrating Democrats in her home state and in Congress, while befuddling pundits, constituents, and journalists about why she legislates the way she does .\n\nBut her choice to go independent was shocking for many Arizonans, including some in the Arizona Democratic Party and former campaign volunteers and canvassers , who were expecting a drawn-out primary fight to ensue ahead of the 2024 general election, when Sinema's seat will be one of 23 Democrats have to defend to keep a Senate majority.\n\nEven before Sinema's announcement, Arizona's 2024 Senate contest was shaping up to be chaos: Potential Democratic challengers were mobilizing, and the state's Republican Party is in the throes of another civil war between its Trumpist, election-denying factions and conventional, business-friendly conservatives. Now, the prospect of a three-way Senate contest with a serious, well-funded independent incumbent during a potential Biden-Trump presidential rematch is almost hard to comprehend.\n\nBut while most attention since Sinema's announcement has been on whether she would be a spoiler candidate for the Democrats or how angry people feel at her decision, there are a few other important questions to consider. Here are three of the most important.\n\nWhether Sinema runs again remains an open question.\n\nAt the moment, she has taken the perfunctory step of filing a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission to begin the campaign process, though she hasn't formally announced a reelection bid. A spokesperson for Sinema did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStill, the conventional wisdom is that she will run, and that her decision to become an independent was a way for her to avoid having to run in a Democratic primary contest that she would almost definitely lose. Public and private polling by different pollsters and campaigns over the last year and a half all show that she is very unpopular among Democrats in the state, and generally unpopular across the board with white voters and voters of color, voters who are college-educated and not, and men and women.\n\nIn interviews during the media rollout of her announcement, she's been cagey about saying whether she will run again. On social media, her personal Twitter account has promoted messages from Arizona local radio interviews in which voters say they would support Sinema in another race.\n\nAnd on YouTube, her political account shared a campaign-style video explaining why she was leaving the Democrats on the day she broke the news. It included a line about how she expected Arizona voters to feel about her decision: \"Arizonans across the state are going to say 'Yeah, that's the Kyrsten we elected. That's who we sent to DC',\" she promised. But she came just short of saying that she hoped to be elected again, or of directing voters to donate money on her campaign website.\n\nArizona-based organizers, pollsters, and strategists I spoke to told me that at the moment, it seems like Sinema is testing the waters in her state, seeing what kind of appetite there is for an independent candidate, and waiting to see if state Democrats coalesce around one candidate.\n\n\"She has always been very strategic. She is two steps ahead of everyone else, of where she's going,\" Mike Noble, a longtime Arizona political strategist and the chief of research at polling firm OH Predictive Insights, told me. Her announcement echoed the decision her predecessor, former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, had to make in 2017 after breaking with Donald Trump, he said.\n\nSinema becoming an independent seems to dare national Democrats to sit out the statewide contest for fear of ceding the race to a Republican. In theory, that could mean her move is a way to get Democrats to support her in 2024. If Democrats choose not to support Sinema, and quickly unite behind one candidate, it could be difficult for her to find the support she'd need to win.\n\nAnd in that case, there's a chance that Sinema sees Democrats putting up a fight and ultimately decides not to run.\n\n\"I am not convinced that she will actually run,\" Alejandra Gomez, the executive director of Living United for Change in Arizona, a progressive Latino organizing group that worked to help Sinema get elected in 2018 (but opposes her now), told me. \"She's trying to figure out where her allies stand, who her people are, and party loyalty. I think she underestimates Democrats standing behind Democrats.\"\n\nGomez told me that she thinks Sinema is counting on disunity among Democrats and Republicans during the primary process to open up a lane for both disaffected Democrats and Republicans to back an independent. \"She's faced with a tall order now that she's put herself in this corner.\"\n\nIt's still an open question of who Sinema's base would be, and what infrastructure would support her 2024 run if Democrats do run their own candidate: Already, her TV ad maker and a top polling firm have stopped working with her, the Huffington Post's Kevin Robillard reported . The tech firm that manages the state party's voter database is cutting her access, and another top progressive consulting firm dropped her as a client this month . A general election campaign without access to the Democratic Party's money, voter contact, and outreach apparatus, as well as its energized base during a presidential year, is a serious obstacle. (Sinema currently has about $8 million in cash on hand .)\n\nArizona's voter pool is split into nearly even thirds between both parties and independents, and Republicans still hold a plurality of registered voters. But those voters with no party preference make up the second-largest group of voters, making them pivotal in statewide elections. In theory, those independent voters would form Sinema's base, but they have tended to split pretty evenly between both parties in statewide races.\n\nThere are a number of viable alternatives Sinema could pursue if she doesn't run, ranging from an appointed position to transitioning into private sector consulting work. She's already a lecturer at Arizona State University. Whether she pursues any of these hinges on the question of why she even wants to be senator.\n\nNext year's primary elections in Arizona might determine whether the state sees a three-way race. It's a little early for any candidate to officially announce right now - donor networks, polling, and staff hiring must be activated first - but there are plenty of potential candidates.\n\nAmong Democrats, the most obvious challenger to Sinema's nomination is Rep. Ruben Gallego, the longtime Congress member from Arizona's recently redrawn Third District. He represents the most Democratic district in the state, which stretches across Phoenix and into parts of Glendale, and has been a vocal critic of Sinema for the last few years. A former Marine, he's a progressive but considers himself less ideological and more practical in his work in Congress, and often criticizes his party for not defending its economic proposals to working-class people harder.\n\nRep. Greg Stanton, a more moderate Arizona Democrat, has also been floated as a possible contender by state political strategists as well as national and local media (he fueled that speculation with a tweet showing what appeared to be internal polling showing how he'd perform against Sinema in a primary). A former Phoenix mayor and city council member , he has served in Congress for slightly less time than Gallego, running for Sinema's old House district in 2018 when she ran for Senate, in the new Fourth District. He's a member of the New Democrat Coalition and has a more centrist identity, but like almost every other Arizona Democrat, he has voted in line with the president's agenda every time.\n\nOther possible competitors in a Democratic primary include Phoenix's current mayor, Kate Gallego, and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, though they haven't spoken about the race.\n\nRepublicans are much more divided. Coming out of a bruising election year that saw Republican candidates lose nearly all top statewide offices, the party faces a civil war between its current Trump-aligned leadership and the more traditional types that have long succeeded in statewide races. Though the state's marquee races have been certified and decided, the 2022 campaign is still not over - Kari Lake, the election-denying Republican loser in the gubernatorial race , launched a legal challenge to the results of the election. But she and outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey are probably the two Republicans with widest name recognition in the state.\n\nDucey comes from a more conventional, pro-business conservative tradition that has a history of victory in the state. He served two terms as governor that he won by large margins, including during the 2018 blue wave that also saw Sinema elected. But his sheen has dulled in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when he stood up to Trump's demands to overturn the results of the presidential election (and faced an onslaught of Trump criticism), endorsed Lake's main opponent in the 2022 gubernatorial primary, and was used by Lake as a foil for her candidacy (she called him \"Do-Nothing Ducey\"). Plenty of congressional Republicans want him to run , but just last week he told local reporters that he's not considering a Senate run .\n\nThe primary opponent Ducey and other establishment Republicans supported against Lake is also a potential contender: Karrin Taylor Robson, the lawyer and housing developer who lent herself $18 million to run a largely self-funded race, has been especially vocal about the need for Arizona's Republican Party to change directions before losing another general election. She's criticized the state party, called for the state chair, election conspiracist Kelli Ward, to step down from leadership, and has branded Lake a fake Republican and a grifter.\n\n\"Our party, in particular in Arizona, was hijacked by fake Republicans,\" Robson told me. \"I've said now, many times: Kelli Ward, and the Arizona GOP, has been an unmitigated disaster. And we have to get back to a place where we know how to win and we do it based on conservative principles.\"\n\nRobson told me she is not ruling out running for statewide office again: \"I was taught to leave my options open and give myself as many options as possible. But it's too early to say.\"\n\nWhether Ducey or Robson can win a Republican primary will depend on how Arizona Republican voters decide to answer the central, existential question that faces them: to continue backing Trump, Lake, election denialism, and more divisive, right-wing politics, or return to the kind of mainstream conservatism represented by John McCain and the pre-Trump Republican Party.\n\nThere are plenty of names that could occupy the former space: Lake, Ward, Rep. Andy Biggs, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, and failed 2022 Senate candidate Blake Masters.\n\nThere aren't many who could champion the latter.\n\nNow consider this: If Sinema did run as an independent, against both Republican and Democratic nominees, would she pull votes away from the Republican, the Democrat, or both?\n\nPlenty of reporting and punditry has assumed that a three-way race would hand the Senate seat to the GOP - that Democrats might nominate someone too far to the left to win a general election, which would push independents and moderate Democrats to vote for Sinema or the Republican.\n\nBut that ignores the very real problems Arizona Republicans are having right now: their inability to move away from Trump and his brand of politics.\n\nRobson told me she hopes state leadership recognizes that most Arizona voters don't want to keep this antagonistic, bombastic, and combative style of politics going for another cycle. \"As I traveled around the state in my campaign, most people out there just want to live their lives,\" she told me. \"They're tired of the fighting, and unfortunately, today's Arizona Republican Party, led by Kelli Ward and magnified by Kari Lake, is all about dividing and tearing people apart, as opposed to bringing people together.\"\n\nFor now, it doesn't seem like establishment Republicans have the upper hand. But should they manage to coalesce around a figure like Robson, Ducey, or state treasurer Kimberly Yee (who just won reelection by 11 points with a more moderate tone ), they would pose a serious threat to both Sinema and a Democratic nominee, Noble, the Arizona pollster, told me.\n\n\"Sinema is banking on Arizona voters to reward her in a hyper-partisan climate, and on filling that void of a Democrat version of John McCain,\" he said. \"Someone that is a center-right Republican versus the current MAGA Republican, that would be your biggest threat, because it makes the numbers much bigger of a challenge and much less feasible for her.\"\n\nHer best case is having Democrats choose a progressive like Gallego, and having Republicans pick a far-right candidate, giving her an opening for moderates from both parties to join independents in voting for her. No candidate needs a majority, so she could theoretically win a plurality.\n\nFor that to work, voters would need to disapprove of those candidates by a bigger margin than they currently dislike her (which, even among independents, is a high bar ). Recent polling commissioned by Gallego shows that not to be the case - even with Sinema running, a theoretical Lake vs. Gallego vs. Sinema matchup is still a toss-up. All this happening during a presidential year means an even more difficult time trying to buy ad time, novel strategies to turn out voters who are thinking in binary ways, and running a campaign without institutional support.\n\nOf course, the only way we'll actually know any of this for sure is to see the campaign play out. Buckle up.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We've had just the worst stuff said about us.\"\n\nLake also acknowledged that Trump can't unilaterally appoint her to this position -- that decision lies with a bipartisan board that would have to remove the current director and approve a new one.\n\nVOA reported last week that its current director, Mike Abramowitz, said in an email to staff that he welcomed \"a smooth transition of power.\"\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

It's normal. Can you as a journalist check this while you're covering the news? To put out a fair and accurate assessment. And so that's what I'm going to be pushing for.\"\n\nLake disclosed that she thinks people will realize she's not the person the \"corporate media\" has described.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel like I have to go, when I meet people, to prove I don't have horns coming out of my head, because the corporate mainstream media has done such a dishonest number on me,\" she said. \"And that's one thing that I can relate to a lot with President Trump. We've had just the worst stuff said about us.\"\n\nLake also acknowledged that Trump can't unilaterally appoint her to this position -- that decision lies with a bipartisan board that would have to remove the current director and approve a new one.\n\nVOA reported last week that its current director, Mike Abramowitz, said in an email to staff that he welcomed \"a smooth transition of power.\"\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Kari Lake announces Arizona Senate run\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nOctober 11, 2023 / 12:02 AM EDT / AP\n\nKari Lake launched a U.S. Senate campaign for an Arizona seat in a splashy Scottsdale rally on Tuesday, having never conceded that she lost last year's race for Arizona governor.\n\nShe is trying out new messages and courting the support of national Republicans she's insulted in the past. But the former television news host isn't backing down on the things that made her a star on the far right - her combativeness with perceived enemies, her fealty to Donald Trump and her willingness to defend his election lies.\n\nNational Republican leaders think a GOP candidate could take advantage of what could be a three-way race if Sen. Kyrsten Sinema seeks reelection. Sinema, a former Democrat who became an independent last year, is preparing for a campaign but has not said whether she will seek a second term. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego is likely to have the Democratic nomination locked up.\n\nAt her rally Tuesday, Lake didn't concede she lost the last election to now-Gov. Katie Hobbs , but didn't say it was stolen and made only a brief mention of it during a nearly 50-minute-long speech. She said she's \"never going to walk away from the fight to restore honest elections.\"\n\n\"We did everything right, and we saw the disaster of election day in Arizona,\" Lake said. \"Sometimes when things don't go the way we expect, we find ourselves questioning and asking why ... I think God has bigger plans for us.\"\n\nShe heaped praise on former President Donald Trump, who recorded a video endorsement that was played at the rally, and repeatedly attacked the media, calling journalists covering her event \"fake news fools.\"\n\n\"When I'm back in the White House, I need strong fighters like Kari in the Senate,\" Trump said.\n\nLake also offered conciliatory words for voters who disagree with her, a sharp contrast with her last campaign, when she didn't want support from establishment Republicans, even after she defeated them in the GOP primary.\n\n\"I may disagree with Arizonans who voted for Joe Biden,\" Lake said. \"But I don't think you're a threat to democracy. You are a citizen just like me.\"\n\nAfter once calling Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky an \"old bat\" and saying he needed to be replaced as Republican leader, Lake now says she would support him if she's elected. Last year, she called abortion \"the ultimate sin\" and supported a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona. Now, she says she wouldn't endorse a federal abortion ban.\n\nLake met recently with Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who leads the GOP's Senate campaign work as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and saw several other GOP senators during a trip to Washington. Daines has publicly urged Lake to focus on the future instead of relitigating past elections.\n\nA former television news anchor for nearly three decades in the Phoenix market, Lake was already known locally but had no national profile when she walked away from her career in 2021, declared \"journalism is dead,\" and took a sledgehammer to televisions showing cable newscasts.\n\nRight up to Election Day, she embraced Trump, appeared with right-wing figures like Steve Bannon and blasted establishment Republicans, including the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nShe lost the governor's race by less than 1 point. About four in 10 Arizona voters in the 2022 election said they were \"very concerned\" that Lake's views were too extreme, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of U.S. voters. She lost 11% of Republicans. About 63% of independents and 96% of Democrats backed the winner, Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nBut Lake became a national figure on the far right with her television appearances and her defense of Trump's election falsehoods.\n\nIn the months since, Lake has traveled extensively to speak to Republican groups around the country, her remarks focused largely on her fraudulent election claims. Her frequent trips to Iowa, the state where she was born but also the host of the leadoff presidential caucuses, have raised eyebrows in political circles. Some have floated her as a running mate for Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nShe sued Maricopa County , claiming election officials deliberately created printer malfunctions to cause her to lose. She lost, and her unsuccessful appeals have bounced through the court system, all the way up to the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nShe also was sued for defamation by Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican official who says he has faced death threats because she lied about how he conducted the election.\n\nLast month she was back in court for her third election-related case, where she watched as her lawyer argued that Arizona's public records law entitles her to see copies of signed vote-by-mail envelopes. She claims reviewing the signatures would allow her to prove that ballots were counted that should not have been, drawing parallels to an unprecedented partisan recount of ballots conducted by Trump supporters on behalf of state Senate Republicans following the 2020 election.\n\nHer fights over the 2020 and 2022 elections have only further endeared her to Arizona Republicans, who nominated a slate of Trump-backed candidates who spread election lies and went on to lose in the midterms. She enters the Senate race as an immediate front-runner in the GOP primary, where she'll face Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb.\n\nThe NRSC has not ruled out endorsing Lake in the primary, according to a person familiar with the organization's strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Support from the NRSC would potentially open up a lucrative funding stream and signal to donors that Lake has the support of key GOP senators.\n\n© 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

She said she's \"never going to walk away from the fight to restore honest elections.\"\n\n\"We did everything right, and we saw the disaster of election day in Arizona,\" Lake said. \"Sometimes when things don't go the way we expect, we find ourselves questioning and asking why ... I think God has bigger plans for us.\"\n\nShe heaped praise on former President Donald Trump, who recorded a video endorsement that was played at the rally, and repeatedly attacked the media, calling journalists covering her event \"fake news fools.\"\n\n\"When I'm back in the White House, I need strong fighters like Kari in the Senate,\" Trump said.\n\nLake also offered conciliatory words for voters who disagree with her, a sharp contrast with her last campaign, when she didn't want support from establishment Republicans, even after she defeated them in the GOP primary.\n\n\"I may disagree with Arizonans who voted for Joe Biden,\" Lake said. \"But I don't think you're a threat to democracy. You are a citizen just like me.\"\n\nAfter once calling Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky an \"old bat\" and saying he needed to be replaced as Republican leader, Lake now says she would support him if she's elected. Last year, she called abortion \"the ultimate sin\" and supported a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona. Now, she says she wouldn't endorse a federal abortion ban.\n\nLake met recently with Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who leads the GOP's Senate campaign work as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and saw several other GOP senators during a trip to Washington. Daines has publicly urged Lake to focus on the future instead of relitigating past elections.\n\nA former television news anchor for nearly three decades in the Phoenix market, Lake was already known locally but had no national profile when she walked away from her career in 2021, declared \"journalism is dead,\" and took a sledgehammer to televisions showing cable newscasts.\n\nRight up to Election Day, she embraced Trump, appeared with right-wing figures like Steve Bannon and blasted establishment Republicans, including the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nShe lost the governor's race by less than 1 point. About four in 10 Arizona voters in the 2022 election said they were \"very concerned\" that Lake's views were too extreme, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of U.S. voters. She lost 11% of Republicans. About 63% of independents and 96% of Democrats backed the winner, Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nBut Lake became a national figure on the far right with her television appearances and her defense of Trump's election falsehoods.\n\nIn the months since, Lake has traveled extensively to speak to Republican groups around the country, her remarks focused largely on her fraudulent election claims. Her frequent trips to Iowa, the state where she was born but also the host of the leadoff presidential caucuses, have raised eyebrows in political circles. Some have floated her as a running mate for Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nShe sued Maricopa County , claiming election officials deliberately created printer malfunctions to cause her to lose. She lost, and her unsuccessful appeals have bounced through the court system, all the way up to the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nShe also was sued for defamation by Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican official who says he has faced death threats because she lied about how he conducted the election.\n\nLast month she was back in court for her third election-related case, where she watched as her lawyer argued that Arizona's public records law entitles her to see copies of signed vote-by-mail envelopes. She claims reviewing the signatures would allow her to prove that ballots were counted that should not have been, drawing parallels to an unprecedented partisan recount of ballots conducted by Trump supporters on behalf of state Senate Republicans following the 2020 election.\n\nHer fights over the 2020 and 2022 elections have only further endeared her to Arizona Republicans, who nominated a slate of Trump-backed candidates who spread election lies and went on to lose in the midterms. She enters the Senate race as an immediate front-runner in the GOP primary, where she'll face Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb.\n\nThe NRSC has not ruled out endorsing Lake in the primary, according to a person familiar with the organization's strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Support from the NRSC would potentially open up a lucrative funding stream and signal to donors that Lake has the support of key GOP senators.\n\n© 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Gallego wins Arizona 2024 Senate election, CBS News projects. See the race results.\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  November 12, 2024 / 1:38 PM EST / CBS News\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego will defeat Republican Kari Lake in the Arizona Senate race, CBS News projects - a crucial win for Democrats as the GOP gained control of the Senate.\n\nGallego and Lake were duking it out for an open seat after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat turned independent , opted not to seek reelection .\n\nGallego, 44, is a Marine combat veteran who was first elected to the House in 2014 and represents a district that includes parts of Phoenix and Glendale. In his campaign for Senate, the progressive lawmaker has worked to court voters in the middle, while painting his opponent as extreme. Gallego would be the first Latino senator to represent Arizona.\n\nLake, who narrowly lost a hard-right campaign for governor in 2022, is a former TV news anchor and close ally of former President Donald Trump. The 55-year-old, who has widespread name recognition in the state, has been a vocal election denier regarding the outcome of both her own gubernatorial race and Trump's 2020 matchup against President Biden. But she often reeled in that message during the Senate campaign. In the lead-up to Election Day, Lake launched personal attacks at Gallego, including about the circumstances of his divorce.\n\nUntil Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of Sen. John McCain's term after his death, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1962.\n\nThe historically Republican state has been a key battleground this cycle, and as a border state, has seen immigration become particularly salient for voters - an issue that has tended to be more favorable for Republicans.\n\nStill, Gallego led in the bulk of statewide polling in the months leading up to the election, and Democrats invested heavily in advertising in the state, which saw among the largest advertising reservations disparities of all the battleground races this cycle. Arizona also has an abortion initiative on the ballot - an issue that has appeared to drive Democrats to the polls in previous elections.\n\nKaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Kari Lake wins GOP Senate primary in Arizona, will take on Ruben Gallego in November\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJuly 31, 2024 / 9:00 AM EDT / AP\n\nKari Lake won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans also were choosing between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nGallego ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate.\n\nAccepting victory Tuesday night, Lake called Trump a \"hero\" and urged his supporters to back her as well.\n\n\"He can't do this alone,\" Lake said. \"He needs backup in Washington, D.C. And I'm going to be his backup.\"\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor , made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nLake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who had contended he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nLake faces Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nThis time, Lake made gestures toward unity, inviting people who didn't vote for her to join her. She said she will need \"people from all walks of life\" and told \"traditional Republicans\" from the GOP establishment that \"we love you.\" But she also framed the general election as \"a battle between good and evil\" and between \"the people who want to destroy this country and the people who want to save America.\"\n\nGallego, she said, \"is an extreme liberal Democrat from Chicago\" who is aligned with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County got their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Justin Heap, a state legislator backed by Lake, knocked incumbent Recorder Stephen Richer out of contention for the general election. Richer is one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections in Arizona's most populous county but became a pariah on the right for aggressively defending election integrity.\n\nRaces for the county board of supervisors, which also plays a major role in running elections, were a mixed bag, with establishment-backed candidates winning in some districts while Republicans aligned with Trump's MAGA movement led elsewhere.\n\nThe feeling that elections are rigged against Republicans has permeated the Arizona GOP, though judges, election experts and Trump's own attorney general have repeatedly rejected claims of widespread fraud.\n\n\"I think that there's primarily the discussion about how to do the elections and how to do them less corruptly,\" said Barb Schwisow, a retired critical care nurse who sat outside a polling place at a table full of Republican pamphlets in Sun City West, a retirement community outside Phoenix.\n\nRepublicans also had an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy. The race was too early to call.\n\nOn the Democratic side, two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area also were too early to call.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.\n\n© 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Kari Lake-Ruben Gallego debate features sparring on immigration, personal barbs\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 10, 2024 / 10:11 AM EDT / CBS/AP\n\nRepublican Senate candidate Kari Lake repeatedly reminded viewers Wednesday of her three-decade career on Arizona television, looking to harness the intimate connection she built with voters and overcome Democrat Ruben Gallego 's portrayal of her as a liar in the only debate of the closely-watched race.\n\nThe Arizona race is one of a handful that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate , where Democrats are fighting an uphill battle to retain their slim majority. The winner will replace independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema , who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party after her relationship with the party's base ruptured.\n\nBoth candidates are working to win over a small share of Republicans and conservative independents who are open to splitting their vote between the parties. This group has been instrumental in the rise of Democrats in Arizona, which has transitioned from a Republican stronghold to a battleground state over the past decade.\n\nLake's comfort and polish in front of the camera stood in contrast to Gallego, a military veteran who occasionally tripped on his words. The hourlong forum, at times caustic and personal, highlighted big differences on immigration, border security, abortion and taxes.\n\n\"Arizona, it's so good to be back with you, where our relationship began, right here in your home,\" Lake said to start the debate.\n\nShe accused Gallego of undergoing an \"extreme makeover\" to downplay his progressive record in the U.S. House and sought to tie him to disorder on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGallego called Lake a liar, pointing to her discredited claim that she won the 2022 race for governor.\n\n\"She will do anything and say anything to gain power, including lying,\" Gallego said.\n\nLake, who became a darling of the populist right after leaving her career as a local television news anchor, has tried but struggled to redefine herself since losing in 2022.\n\nGallego, who represents largely Latino areas of Phoenix, has used his financial advantage over Lake to run ads playing up his military service and up-by-the-bootstraps personal story rather than his progressive record in the House.\n\nThe debate, which aired live on most television stations across the state, presented Lake with a chance to reset a race where polls and observers suggest she's modestly trailing. For Gallego, it was an opportunity to introduce himself to the voters who still don't know him.\n\nThe first half of the debate was devoted to immigration and border security, the issues Lake has put at the center of her pitch to voters. She pointed to Gallego's prior comments critical of a border wall, tied him to President Biden's border policies and said he supports \"open borders\" and \"voted against border security every step of the way.\"\n\n\"Your votes on the border have empowered the cartels,\" she said, calling illegal border crossings an \"invasion.\" She also alleged Gallego \"wants\" undocument immigrants to vote, a claim that CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO fact-checked as \"false.\"\n\nLake also alleged that hospitals have had to close down due to border crossings, which KPHO also ranked as false. The future of five hospitals in Arizona is in doubt when the owner of Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy, according to KPHO, after allegations of corporate mismanagement . A year-and-a-half-long investigation by CBS News has documented how private equity and other investor groups have siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars from community hospitals with devastating public health consequences.\n\nGallego pushed back, saying borders are necessary and walls are an important part of security, but only if coupled with sufficient manpower and technology. He faulted Lake for opposing a bipartisan border security bill agreed to by Mr. Biden and key lawmakers, which died after former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to oppose it.\n\n\"You've been to Mar-a-Lago more than you've been to the border,\" Gallego said, calling attention to Lake's frequent trips to Trump's resort in south Florida.\n\nLake pushed Gallego to support deporting everyone living in the country illegally. He pushed her to oppose deporting \"dreamers,\" a group of immigrants brought to the country as children. They did not agree on either.\n\nThey have fought to focus voters on the issue most favorable to them. For Lake, that's the border.\n\nFor Gallego, it's abortion rights after a state Supreme Court ruling outlawed virtually all abortions until the Legislature rolled the ban back to after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Lake has spoken favorably of stricter limits.\n\n\"She said she was thrilled that Roe was overturned,\" Gallego said. \"And so, do we want politicians like Kari Lake to be involved in these very, very difficult decisions when they should be left to the woman and the family?\"\n\nLake said she would not vote for a federal abortion ban and pointed to a ballot measure that will be presented to Arizona voters next month.\n\n\"We have the choice as Arizonans to decide what our abortion law will be,\" Lake said. \"It's going to be up to us.\"\n\nLake is an unflinching supporter of Trump and his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. She has never conceded she lost her own 2022 race for governor, and continued to fight the outcome in court even after launching her Senate campaign. Separately, she's tried and failed to persuade courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year, to outlaw the use of electronic voting machines.\n\nShe's also highlighted Gallego's 2016 divorce from Kate Gallego, who is now the mayor of Phoenix. Noting the marriage ended weeks before the couple's son was born, Lake says Gallego abandoned his wife while she was pregnant. Kate Gallego has endorsed her ex-husband and campaigned with him as recently as last week.\n\n\"Look at his character and his background,\" Lake said Wednesday.\n\nThe son of immigrants from Mexico and Colombia, Gallego was raised in Chicago by a single mother and eventually accepted to Harvard University. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve while he was on a break from Harvard. He fought in Iraq in 2005 in a unit that sustained heavy casualties, including the death of his best friend.\n\nHe pointed repeatedly to his military service during the debate.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "How one of MAGA's brightest stars went from unstoppable to long shot\n\nAs a group of Rep. Ruben Gallego's supporters gathered at a bar in downtown Phoenix last Wednesday to watch his Senate debate with Kari Lake, the sense of confidence in the room was palpable, if unusual for a Democratic campaign in a historically conservative state like Arizona.\n\n\"I think he's going to carry this with no problem,\" said Democratic state Rep. Patty Contreras. \"I don't think she stands a chance.\"\n\nThat wasn't the assessment made by Contreras, or most other Arizona Democrats, when Lake made her political debut three years ago as a gubernatorial candidate. Combative yet charismatic, Lake was quickly recognized as the most skilled purveyor of Trumpism aside from the former president himself. She wasn't simply imitating Donald Trump but refashioning his political style to fit her own profile as a well-known local TV anchor. It didn't hurt that her opponent was then-Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who even Democrats will admit is a less-than-stellar campaigner . \"She was a fresh face, she was well spoken,\" Contreras said of Lake, adding that Hobbs \"sometimes is not as articulate as we would like her to be.\"\n\nLake was widely expected to win that year, and Democrats regarded her with fear. But then she lost, albeit by just two-thirds of a percentage point.\n\nIn the intervening years, as she's traveled the country as one of the MAGA movement's biggest celebrities , she has expended the bulk of her political oxygen insisting that the election was stolen from her . The consensus that emerged from interviews here with not just Arizona's political experts but even Republicans who plan to vote for her is that Lake gradually dug her own political grave by doing so.\n\n\"Don't tell me that you're angry about the last election,\" said Rep. David Schweikert, a Republican who represents a Scottsdale-area swing district, adding that voters \"don't care\" about the \"resentments\" that Lake and other candidates are campaigning on.\n\nWith Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the picture and Lake flailing, Gallego has had the space to run a successful version of the campaign that Vice President Kamala Harris has sought to wage at the presidential level, where a lawmaker who once wore progressivism on their sleeve has triangulated toward the center in the face of Trumpist opposition.\n\nA large chunk of the state's more traditional Republicans continue to feel alienated by Lake's denigration of the late Sen. John McCain and his supporters during her 2022 campaign. That's allowed Gallego to court Republicans like Julie Spilsbury, a city councilor in Mesa who's backing the Democratic congressman even as she acknowledges that he's been \"pretty far left\" throughout his career.\n\n\"I've seen a willingness to moderate,\" Spilsbury told a small group of reporters at a \"Republicans for Harris\" event in Mesa last week, adding that Harris and Gallego were \"big-tent Democrats that say, 'We want you,'\" while \"the Republicans are saying, 'Get the hell out of our party.'\"\n\nThe situation is all the more remarkable given that political headwinds in Arizona - a state disproportionally affected by both inflation and the border crisis - have been blowing rightward. While Trump and Harris remain locked in a dead-heat race for the state's 11 electoral votes, Gallego boasts a polling lead over Lake that's outside the state's margin of error.\n\nLake's campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But at a press conference last week, she told reporters that she had \"zero faith in the public polling\" of her race and insisted that her own internal polls showed a tight race. \"These polls are meant to take the oxygen out of our movement,\" Lake argued. \"They're meant to keep donors away.\"\n\nLake remains a skilled politician, a fact that was apparent during last week's debate, where she smoothly lobbed attacks at Gallego as he occasionally tripped over his words. But the congressman's supporters remained relaxed throughout the event, breaking into laughter when Lake professed a desire to put \"country over party\" or erroneously referred to in vitro fertilization as \"UVF.\"\n\nSomeone needs to tell Kari Lake it's actually \"IVF\" and not \"UVF.\" She would  know that if she actually supported IVF. #AZSen pic.twitter.com/sVJPKcFWp4\n\n\"She was certainly a juggernaut when she ran for governor,\" said Kirk Adams, a Republican who was Gov. Doug Ducey's chief of staff and once served as the speaker of the Arizona House. But today, Adams argued, she's primarily defined by her status as a political loser. \"If you were to ask people, 'What do you know about Kari Lake?', there are likely two things that they will tell you: She was a news anchor for a very long time, and she thinks that the 2022 election was stolen from her.\"\n\nIt's a facet of Lake's candidacy that rankles even her supporters. Maryjane Carsten, a 71-year-old Republican retiree who lives in Oracle, said she felt like she was \"voting for the best of the worst\" in the Senate race.\n\n\"I like that she's a conservative,\" Carsten said as she made her way into Sen. JD Vance's rally in Tucson on Wednesday. \"But she just would not let that election go. She just won't let stuff go. She needs to.\"\n\nCompounding that issue is Lake's unclear positioning on abortion. Like many Republicans, she has pledged not to support a national abortion ban, though she told reporters last week that she voted against a ballot measure to expand abortion rights in Arizona. She's also expressed conflicting views on a near-total abortion ban that almost took effect in the state this year, expressing opposition only to later bemoan that it wasn't being enforced.\n\n\"She's lost credibility with a giant portion of the electorate, which, at the beginning of that game, could have been hers,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a former GOP political strategist in Arizona who's backing Gallego.\n\nOf course, Trump has also refused to concede his last election and has offered conflicting views on abortion. But while a Lake win at this point would be an upset, that's not the case for Trump. The difference between the candidates may come down to the fact that the former president is, well, a former president who has a mostly positive economic record to run on.\n\n\"The Donald Trump playbook only really works for one person, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Barrett Marson, a Republican political strategist in Arizona.\n\nMike Noble, the founder and CEO of the Arizona polling firm Noble Predictive Insights, said his polling had found that voters, including Republicans, simply viewed Lake differently. \"She does have all the baggage Trump has,\" Noble said, \"but she doesn't have any of the positives, the policy wins and things like that.\"\n\nThe election is just over three weeks away, and Lake is hobbling toward the finish line. She trails Gallego in public polling by an average of 7 percentage points, and she's consistently struggled to keep up with the Democratic congressman's fundraising machine. Early this month, Gallego's campaign said he had raised more than $50 million since he entered the race, with $21.7 million of that sum coming in since July. Lake's campaign has declined to release her latest fundraising figures, suggesting they're lackluster.\n\nDeep-pocketed national GOP groups have also largely avoided the race as they've plunged tens of millions of dollars into more-promising targets . Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, hasn't spent a dime in Arizona this year.\n\n\"Normally, these things are more competitive,\" Noble said. \"This Senate race should be more competitive.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake bashes Arizona's new abortion ban. She praised it less than 2 years ago.\n\nKari Lake, the Trump acolyte and Arizona GOP Senate candidate, says she does not support a near-total ban on abortion that's set to take effect soon in the crucial battleground state.\n\nThat law, more than 160 years old, was written when Arizona had not yet become a state and would outlaw abortion in all instances, except to save the life of the mother.\n\n\"I have traveled to every corner of this state on the campaign trail,\" Lake said in a statement on Tuesday. \"I speak to more Arizonans than anyone and it is abundantly clear that the pre-statehood law is out of step with Arizonans.\"\n\nLake's statement came soon after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the 1864 law, which mandates two to five years in prison for anyone who aids in abortion, was enforceable. However, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has said that she will not enforce the law, which she described as \"draconian.\"\n\nArizona voters will also get to decide on the issue of abortion rights in a November referendum, and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and the GOP-controlled state legislature could, in theory, seek to change the law.\n\nYet Lake's stated position on the territorial-era law is a significant reversal from 2022, when she was running for governor of Arizona.\n\nIn June of that year, Lake said in a local radio interview that she supported the 1864 law, according to Politifact.\n\n\"I'm incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the books,\" Lake said in that interview, adding: \"It will prohibit abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother. And I think we're going to be paving the way and setting course for other states to follow.\"\n\nLake's reversal comes as Republicans more broadly seek to reposition themselves on abortion, given the losses that the GOP has suffered in races and ballot measures across the country since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nAs she's mounted her Senate bid, Lake has sought to emphasize her status as a mother and said that she supports efforts to make motherhood easier, moving away from harsher anti-abortion rhetoric that she employed during her failed gubernatorial bid.\n\nAnd on Monday, former President Donald Trump said that he believed abortion should be left to states to decide, the latest in a series of conflicting positions he's taken on abortion.\n\nLake is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in a race that could determine control of the Senate . In a statement, Gallego also bashed the court's ruling while tying it to \"extremist politicians like Kari Lake.\"\n\nLake isn't the only Republican who's seeking to distance themselves from the law.\n\nReps. Juan Ciscomani and Dave Schweikert, two Arizona Republicans who face competitive reelection races, also said that they do not support the law and called on Hobbs and the legislature to overturn it.\n\nI do not support today's ruling from the AZ Supreme Court. This issue should be decided by Arizonans, not legislated from the bench. I encourage the state legislature to address this issue immediately.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Kari Lake keeps making money off of her MAGA celebrity brand\n\nThe GOP's hopes of retaking the Senate rest in part on Kari Lake, the former TV broadcaster and 2022 gubernatorial candidate who's poised to become the party's Senate nominee in Arizona.\n\nBut Lake keeps spending lots of time outside the state , much to the chagrin of Republicans - including former President Donald Trump.\n\nAs it turns out, she's making some extra money by doing it.\n\nLake was paid $20,000 by to appear at the the St. Joseph County Republican Party's Lincoln Day Dinner in South Bend, Indiana, according to a financial disclosure filed at the end of June.\n\nThe Arizona Republican previously filed a disclosure in January, revealing that she had given several paid speeches , totaling $75,000, in the year before she announced her campaign in October 2023. The new April payment appears to contradict her campaign's previous statement that Lake \"doesn't [charge] a speaking fee.\"\n\nIn the five months since filing her January disclosure, Lake also brought in an additional $27,738.77 from sales of her book, \"Unafraid.\"\n\nHer June disclosure also included further details of her agreement with the agreement she made with right-wing publisher Winning Team Publishing in 2023: a $100,000 advance, plus $25% of net profits beyond that.\n\nThe candidate's assets are largely the unchanged from January, aside from one notable addition to her stock portfolio: Between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that run's the former president's \"Truth Social\" platform.\n\nLake's campaign did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe GOP candidate is all but certain to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego this fall in what will be a key race for determining control of the Senate.\n\nPlenty of politicians in both parties have found ways to cash in on their celebrity brands, most often through book sales that can sometimes exceed their official salaries. But Lake has yet to win an election, and some Republicans have grumbled about the fact that she's spent a significant amount of time out of state.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "It pays to be MAGA: Kari Lake raked in $175,000 from speeches and book royalties in the year since losing the Arizona governor's race\n\nEven when you lose, you can come out a winner.\n\nKari Lake, the pugnacious acolyte of former President Donald Trump who still hasn't conceded her 2022 loss in the Arizona governor's race, is making plenty of money off her enduring star power on the right.\n\nAccording to financial disclosure documents that Lake filed as part of her US Senate bid on Tuesday, the former TV anchor made at least $175,000 from paid speeches and book royalties.\n\nThat includes $100,000 from Winning Team Publishing, the Trump-aligned outfit that published Lake's book, \"Unafraid,\" in 2023.\n\nThe other $75,000 came from speeches Lake gave to conservative groups in Texas, California, New York, and Idaho, sometimes netting $15,000 for one appearance.\n\nAltogether, that's more than the $174,000 salary that she would make as a senator.\n\nLake was required by federal law to file the disclosures. She's all but certain to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in the general election, and may face incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema as well.\n\nIn a statement, a Lake spokesperson accused the media of having \"Kari Lake derangement syndrome.\"\n\nThe disclosures also reveal $101,507 in wages from Superfeed Technologies, a company once owned by former Arizona GOP chairman Jeff DeWit.\n\nLake notably accused DeWit last week of trying to bribe her into staying out of politics, leading him to resign his position after she purportedly threatened to release even more damaging audio.\n\nIn his resignation statement, DeWit did note that Lake was on his payroll at the time of their conversation - though he denied the bribery allegations.\n\n\"Instead of focusing on a public official unethically attempting to bribe Kari from seeking federal office, the media is fixated on her financial disclosure, which is not news,\" the Lake spokesperson said. \"She reported the same thing when she ran for Governor two years ago and acted ethically. DeWit was never her boss, as he never owned the company.\"\n\nLake did file a financial disclosure when she ran for governor, disclosing her position as a communications advisor for DeWit's firm.\n\nHowever, those documents did not reveal Lake's compensation amounts and included just two paid appearances.\n\nLake certainly isn't alone in cashing in on being a political celebrity. Lawmakers on both the left and the right have, in some cases, managed to make more than their salaries via book sales.\n\nIn 2022, top earners from book sales including Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Elizabeth Warren, while Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton led the list for Republicans.\n\nJump to"

Trump lost Arizona by over 10,000 votes .\n\nSpeaking to the far-right outlet One American News Network, Lake told host Natalie Harp that she would not have certified the 2020 election results. Lake has routinely echoed Trump's baseless claims of election fraud .\n\n\"Considering how much already at the time information we had about serious irregularities and problems with the election, I would not have certified it right then,\" Lake said. Election results are normally certified by the secretary of state, the governor, and other state officials.\n\nDuring the interview, Harp claimed the election results certified by Ducey \"weren't accurate\" - a claim that was partially proven true this month after a Republican-led election audit found that Biden actually beat Trump by a few hundred more votes in Arizona than previously thought.\n\nDespite the audit results, Lake said last week that the election was \"fraudulent\" and \"corrupted.\" Trump made similar claims after the audit results were released, falsely saying they further proved \"significant and undeniable evidence of FRAUD!\"\n\n\"My reaction is we have to make this right. We do not move on from this moment. We do not move on from November 2020 until we make this right,\" Lake said to OANN September 26, calling for criminal charges against \"the people who are involved with this.\"\n\nOn September 28, Trump endorsed Lake , saying she \"will do a far better job than RINO Governor Doug Ducey--won't even be a contest!\" Ducey lost favor with Trump when he went ahead with certifying the state's presidential election results in late November 2020 while ignoring a phone call from Trump .\n\nDucey doubled down on his decision on the evening he and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs certified the election results.\n\n\"This can ONLY be delayed if counties DECLINE to certify their results. ALL 15 counties in Arizona - counties run by both parties - certified their results,\" Ducey tweeted on November 30, 2020.\n\n\"That's the law. I've sworn an oath to uphold it, and I take my responsibility seriously,\" he added.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "An Arizona judge ruled against Kari Lake's efforts to overturn the election outcome\n\nAn Arizona judge on Saturday rejected Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake's effort to overturn her election defeat, ruling that Lake failed to prove that elections officials had intentionally engaged in misconduct, and similarly failed to prove the election outcome was swayed as a result.\n\nLake lost the gubernatorial election in November to Democrat Katie Hobbs by 17,117 votes, and immediately alleged that hundreds of thousands of illegal votes had been cast, swinging the election to her opponent, echoing many of former President Donald Trump's claims following his 2020 election loss.\n\nJudge Peter Thompson said Saturday that technical issues during the Arizona election certainly caused \"inconvenience and confusion\" for voters on Election Day, but that Lake had not provided evidence that any of the issues were deliberately caused, and they resulted in Lake's loss.\n\nLake \"has no free-standing right to challenge election results based on what [Lake] believes - rightly or wrongly - went awry on Election Day,\" Judge Peter Thompson wrote in his decision. \"She must, as a matter of law, prove a ground that the legislature has provided as a basis for challenging an election.\"\n\nHe continued: \"A court setting such a margin aside, as far as the Court is able to determine, has never been done in the history of the United States.\"\n\nLake had originally sued over the election results , citing 10 claims of various forms of election malfeasance. The judge rejected eight of them, and allowed her to proceed on two counts. That culminated in a two-day trial in Phoenix earlier this week.\n\nOn Saturday, Lake tweeted that she would appeal Thompson's ruling.\n\n\"My Election Case provided the world with evidence that proves our elections are run outside of the law,\" she wrote. \"This Judge did not rule in our favor. However, for the sake of restoring faith and honesty in our elections, I will appeal his ruling.\"\n\nThe campaign manager for Governor-elect Katie Hobbs, Nicole DeMont, released a statement on Saturday praising Thompson's decision and saying Hobbs is continuing her efforts to prepare to take office.\n\n\"Last month, Arizonans made their voices heard at the ballot box. They chose sanity over chaos, and commonsense, bipartisan results over division,\" the statement said. \"The voters of Arizona - not the conspiracy-riddled, dark corners of the Internet - are the ones who choose our leaders.\"\n\nJump to"

Kyrsten Sinema is not running for reelection - denying the political world the opportunity to see what would've been one of the most fascinating Senate races in recent memory.\n\nWhen the mercurial senator announced her decision to leave the Democratic Party at the end of 2022, many believed that it was a calculated political move to boost her chances of reelection, especially considering that she would remain a part of the Democratic majority in the Senate.\n\nA message for Arizonans from Senator Kyrsten Sinema pic.twitter.com/1XWFSWgGdh\n\nAfter all, she had angered most of her party over her opposition to aspects of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda and her resistance to changing the Senate's 60-vote filibuster rule. She was also likely to lose the Democratic primary to Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona.\n\nSince then, Sinema had stubbornly refused to say whether she would seek reelection, even as her campaign touted the more than $10 million she had to spend.\n\nHer announcement on Tuesday guarantees that the Arizona Senate race will feature a head-to-head matchup between Gallego and Kari Lake , a former broadcast journalist and staunch ally of former President Donald Trump who has refused to concede her loss in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\n\nIn other words, it will be a race that pits a progressive-leaning Democrat against a fire-breathing MAGA acolyte. Many such cases.\n\nSinema's exit may give Lake a bit more of an opening than she had before, given that polling showed that the independent senator drew much of her dwindling support from Republican voters in the state.\n\nSen. Steve Daines of Montana, the chair of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said in a statement that Sinema's retirement \"improves Kari Lake's opportunity to flip this seat.\"\n\nYet Lake couldn't pull it off in 2022, despite widespread perceptions that she was favored in that year's governor's race. And as far as GOP candidates go, Lake tends more toward the extreme, vocally embracing Trump's lies about a stolen 2020 election and calling for the imprisonment of her opponent during the 2022 race.\n\nLake has since sought to moderate her image, including by telling NBC News in a recent interview that she opposed a federal abortion ban, despite previously endorsing a state-level abortion ban in Arizona that left no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThat's not to say Gallego has it in the bag - he's more openly progressive than other Democrats who've won statewide office in Arizona in recent years, and polling has shown him roughly even with Lake in a hypothetical matchup.\n\nBut while Lake and Gallego duke it out, Sinema can plan for a cushy retirement .\n\nShe once told Sen. Mitt Romney, a recently published biography of the Utah Republican said, that she didn't care if her stances cost her reelection.\n\n\"I don't care. I can go on any board I want to. I can be a college president. I can do anything,\" the book quoted Sinema as saying. \"I saved the Senate filibuster by myself. I saved the Senate by myself. That's good enough for me.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Sinema told Business Insider last year that those remarks were \"misconstrued and mistaken\" during a \"game of telephone.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The Arizona primary where the MAGA movement is devouring itself\n\nIt's a subject that Abe Hamadeh can't seem to avoid.\n\nIn campaign trail appearances in the Phoenix area last month, the Republican congressional candidate, an Arab American with a Muslim father, inevitably made some sort of reference to the barrage of television ads and near-ubiquitous yard signs that have painted him as an Islamic terrorist sympathizer.\n\n\"How many of you guys have seen these nasty ads against me?\" Hamadeh asked the few dozen Republicans who had ventured to a crowded antique shop in a northern Phoenix strip mall to hear him speak. \"They're pretty bad. I look at them and I'm like, 'I've got a lot of facial hair in those ads.'\"\n\nOn paper, Hamadeh - his party's nominee for state attorney general in 2022 - should be the presumptive winner of the GOP primary for Arizona's 8th congressional district. He's been endorsed for Congress by former President Donald Trump and has the enthusiastic backing of Kari Lake , the former gubernatorial candidate and all-but-certain Senate nominee who remains popular among the MAGA faithful in Arizona.\n\nYet Hamadeh remains stuck in an apparent dead heat with the man behind the nasty ads: Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel protégé and 2022 Senate nominee who's plowed millions of dollars of his own fortune into his opposing bid for the seat. \"He is running a very bigoted race,\" Hamadeh told me of Masters, \"and MAGA and the America First movement is bigger than that.\"\n\nThis primary, described by some as the nastiest in America, will be a test of that proposition - whether conservative voters can look past any drummed-up suspicions about Hamadeh's background to elect one of Arizona's most fervent election deniers. It's also a window into what may be the future of Republican politics, where what happens on the internet can matter more to voters than what happens in the state legislature, and where politics becomes so thoroughly nationalized that one candidate, Blake Masters, can plausibly seek to represent a House district over 100 miles from his home in Tucson.\n\nThis congressional seat, anchored by tens of thousands of older voters from around the country who've ensconced themselves behind the gates of sprawling, palm tree-studded retirement communities, is overwhelmingly Republican. Whoever wins on July 30 is all but guaranteed to go to Washington.\n\nIf Masters and Hamadeh dropped out, the race would still be crowded. There's Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, who's been endorsed by the district's retiring congresswoman, Rep. Debbie Lesko. There's state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was on the steps of the US Capitol on January 6 and now faces charges over his role as one of the state's fake Trump electors in 2020. There's even former Rep. Trent Franks, who previously represented the district before resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal in 2017.\n\nBut those other men have largely become an afterthought. While they may possess the legislative records and strong ties to the district that Hamadeh and Masters lack, both frontrunners possess something far more crucial for winning a wide-open Republican primary in 2024, especially in a district like this: High name recognition and MAGA-world stardom.\n\nIt's virtually impossible to drive through the suburban roads of northwest Maricopa County without seeing one: A large corrugated cardboard sign blaring the phrase \"America was founded on Islamic principles\" in bold yellow text beside a photo of Hamadeh at the Kaaba in Mecca, dressed in the ihram clothing that Muslims wear during the Hajj pilgrimage. One of Masters's TV ads also declares that Hamadeh \"blamed Israel for 9/11\" and once supported a pathway to citizenship for people living in the country illegally.\n\nAs startling as the ads are, there's been little widespread outrage or condemnation among local Republicans, including the incumbent congresswoman. \"You know, I've been involved in politics for a while,\" Lesko told me while walking to vote at the Capitol. \"I expect everything. It's a lively primary, and may the best person win.\"\n\nWhile Masters is twisting his opponent's words - the 33-year-old Hamadeh made most of the statements in question when he was a teenager, browsing the same kinds of mid-2000s message boards that Masters notably used to frequent - his negative campaign is capitalizing on real complexities about the Trump-backed candidate's political identity.\n\nHamadeh is the son of Syrian immigrants - a Muslim father and a Druze mother - who moved to Chicago in 1989 and overstayed their visas . His name was \"Ibrahem\" before he anglicized it to \"Abraham\" in 2010. His parents faced the threat of deportation in 1996 after his father, a jeweler living in Skokie, was indicted in connection with a 1994 synagogue firebombing , though prosecutors were unable to definitively connect him to the crime, and the charges were ultimately dropped. His father successfully appealed that deportation order , citing the fact that two of his children, including Abe, were born in the United States and were thus citizens. Masters's campaign has gone as far as to call Hamadeh an \"anchor baby.\"\n\nHamadeh's family later moved to Arizona. \"As soon as they got off the flight, they looked at each other and they said, 'Wow, we found the Middle East of America,'\" he told the antique shop crowd. In his youth, Hamadeh apparently identified on some level as a Muslim, writing in a Ron Paul Forums post in 2009 that he would be the \"first arab american/muslim senator ooooh yeah.\" It was that same year, on that same forum, that Hamadeh made the \"Islamic principles\" comment , in which he was arguing against the demonization of Muslims while referencing a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad at the Supreme Court. He also blamed \"Israeli Mossad\" for the September 11th terror attacks, though he later disavowed those views in an interview with the Daily Wire.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Arizona's law school in 2016, Hamadeh worked as a prosecutor in the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and joined the US Army Reserve as an intelligence officer. He made the trek to Mecca during a 14-month deployment to Saudi Arabia from 2020 to 2021.\n\nTwo years ago, Hamadeh's religious background was a clear asset for a MAGA movement that has at times been keen to highlight its non-white adherents: In 2022, a local conservative outlet promoted the Mecca photo to illustrate the GOP's \"bigger tent.\" Yet Hamadeh himself speaks about it now with some detachment. \"My dad is Muslim, my mom is Druze, I have family who are Christian,\" he told me. \"I've been to Jerusalem, I've been to Istanbul, the Vatican, Thailand, Japan. I'm very non-denominational, I don't identify really with one particular faith. I just have a belief in God, and I believe Jesus is going to return to Earth, but I think organized religion, in many ways, has failed so many people.\"\n\nThe Republican Party is replete with ambitious politicians fashioning themselves to fit the moment, and Hamadeh has played his cards right. In the space of several months in 2022, he emerged from relative obscurity to become the party's nominee for attorney general, winning Trump's endorsement as the result of his unflinching devotion to the former president's stolen 2020 election claims and perhaps a well-timed loan from his wealthy brother. Running on a ticket with Masters and Lake, he came the closest of the trio to winning in 2022, falling just 280 votes short in what he calls \"the closest statewide race in Arizona history that everybody just seems to ignore.\" He has since insisted that he is the rightful winner of that election, and he's now on his fourth lawsuit over the results.\n\nHamadeh's chief identity is that of a fighter, a \"happy warrior\" as he puts it. During the first primary debate, he referred to himself as a \"young man with a lot of testosterone.\" He's prone to trash-talking his political adversaries, quipping after our interview that Ben Toma is \"gonna get 12%\" in the primary and that \"nobody talks about\" Trent Frank's \"sexual shit.\" He's also demonstrated a fluency in the parlance of the MAGA faithful, proclaiming to his supporters that \"this is a 1776 moment\" while warning them to be \"cognizant of all of these psyops.\"\n\n\"They're not just after me, they're after all of you,\" Hamadeh declared during his antique shop stump speech, echoing a favored line of the former president. \"You all are a threat, just for being here.\"\n\nWhile Hamadeh's calling card is stolen elections and a medley of contemporary MAGA bromides, Blake Masters is most closely associated with the New Right , an idiosyncratic form of conservatism that seeks national transformation along nationalistic, populist lines. The movement's most prominent spokesman in the halls of Congress is Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who has endorsed Masters and is currently in the running to be Trump's vice-presidential pick.\n\nBut while Vance made it across the finish line in 2022, Masters did not, owing in large part to a slew of alienating comments he made during free-wheeling interviews he gave during his Senate campaign. At one point, Masters named Ted Kacynski, a domestic terrorist known more commonly as the \"Unabomber,\" as a \"subversive thinker that's underrated.\" This year, he appears to be taking a more disciplined approach. \"Blake is really not doing any more interviews for the rest of the campaign,\" his spokesperson told me in June.\n\n\"This guy, he lost against Mark Kelly because he's a weirdo,\" Hamadeh told me. \"He's a weirdo and nobody likes him, quite frankly. Kari and I were trying to drag him up, and look how he repays us.\"\n\nBereft of the Trump endorsement, Masters has turned to running ads blaring that Trump endorsed his Senate campaign, an apparent attempt to muddy the waters that's drawn the ire of the former president's inner circle. Lacking the \"stolen election\" credibility that Hamadeh and Lake have - unlike the other two, he has fully acknowledged that he lost his Senate race - Masters has made illegal immigration the centerpiece of a starkly nativist campaign, pledging at one recent debate to be the \"most conservative, most right-wing, anti-immigration member of Congress.\"\n\nAt a forum in the Sun City West retirement community, where each House candidate was given just four minutes to make their pitch to a crowd of roughly 300 Republicans, Masters spent roughly half of this allotment on the issue.\n\n\"Illegal immigration is a cancer,\" Masters said. \"It is ruining our country. It's common sense: If you import the Third World, you become the Third World. I think the Left is obsessed with replacing us. If you're a sort of 'heritage American,' if you're a white American, they hate you. The Left hates how you look, they hate the way you think. If you're a minority here, and you're willing to come to this room as a Republican or an independent conservative, well, they hate you for being a turncoat. Look at how they treat the best Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas, right? The Left is demented.\"\n\nIn May, Masters leaked a text that Hamadeh sent to him in which the former attorney general candidate appeared to privately mock those who believe in stolen elections. \"I'm not lumped in with crazies with election stuff because I'm so close at 280, but the crazies love because they see me fighting,\" Hamadeh said in part. When I asked Hamadeh who he was referring to when he said \"crazies,\" he laughed it off.\n\n\"We're all crazies,\" Hamadeh said, his face curling into a sardonic grin. \"It's ironic. I call everybody crazy. It's actually a very endearing term in these times.\"\n\nAs Hamadeh has waged his counteroffensive against Masters, he's done the same thing that Democrats did to the 37-year-old tech entrepreneur in 2022: Dredging up his long history of online commentary, including internet forum comments from his libertarian days calling for \"unrestricted\" immigration and his residence in a vegan co-op while attending Stanford University.\n\nWhile Thiel has stepped back from overt involvement in politics this year, Hamadeh has sought to turn Masters's association with the right-wing tech billionaire - who Business Insider revealed last year to be an FBI informant - against him, pointing to a nearly $25 million bonus that Masters earned from Thiel Capital in 2023. \"I think that warrants some investigative journalism,\" Hamadeh told me. A person familiar with Masters's compensation package, which the candidate revealed in financial disclosures this year, said that the payment was a bonus that Masters was owed in accordance with an industry-standard contract that he signed in 2018.\n\nBack at the antique shop, Hamadeh opened up the floor for questions, including half a dozen about whether this November's election might also be stolen, one about whether a newly concocted virus or \"a meltdown of the grid\" might prompt a cancellation of the election, another about \"what can we do\" to fight \"the deep state,\" and precisely zero about what specific policies Hamadeh might champion if he were elected to represent the 8th district.\n\nIn fact, we weren't even in the 8th district - we were five miles away from its easternmost edge. \"I can't vote for you,\" one woman, apparently not a prospective constituent, told Hamadeh as she shook hands with him after the event, \"but I'll give you a donation.\" Hamadeh did grow up in the area, but he's lived in Scottsdale for years. Hamadeh's campaign says that he has since re-established residency in the district, while Masters continues to live all the way in Tucson.\n\nBut charges of \"carpetbagging\" don't exactly land the same in Arizona: Most of the state's residents are transplants from out of state, and that's even more true of the tens of thousands of retirement community residents - many of whom likely pay more attention to Fox News or alternative media sources than the Arizona Republic - who make up a large chunk of the local GOP electorate and are the most likely to actually vote.\n\nIt is under these conditions that this primary's top two candidates, neither of whom have held elected office, are waging an ugly fistfight, much of it via dueling \"War Room\" accounts on X. When Hamadeh talks about issues specific to the district, it's to speculate that Chinese nationals may be crossing the southern border to surveil the sprawling TSMC semiconductor plant undergoing construction in the northern reaches of the district. Masters, meanwhile, proudly told the Sun City West crowd that he's \"honored to have won and beat Mark Kelly\" by \"seven or eight points\" in the district when he ran for Senate.\n\nAs attendees streamed out of the candidate forum, few stopped to shake hands with Ben Toma, the mild-mannered state House speaker who had politely warned the crowd to \"be careful of noisemakers\" and touted his record of enacting key conservative priorities on tax cuts and education reform while keeping a narrow, fractious majority in line.\n\n\"I don't think this new breed of in-your-face, always rushing to tweet or post something on social media, or run after a network camera, is good for us,\" Toma told me.\n\nBut Toma may simply be too much of a nice guy for this climate. He wasn't offering the red meat being sold by Hamadeh, who was busy holding court with a steady procession of voters on the other side of the room. He also can't compete with the personal war chest of Masters, who had apparently already bolted from the event.\n\nMoments earlier, I had overheard Toma explaining to one attendee - apparently unaware of what office he held - that he was, in fact, the speaker of the Arizona House.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump says Kari Lake will lead Voice of America. He attacked it during his first term\n\nBy\n\nRachel Treisman\n\n,\n\nDavid Folkenflik\n\nKari Lake, pictured at the Republican National Convention in July, is President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Voice of America. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says Kari Lake, a local television news anchor-turned-MAGA politician, will lead the federally funded broadcaster Voice of America.\n\nIf successful, the move would put a loyalist at the helm of a news outlet that Trump sought to bring to heel under his appointee during the final year of his first term. Trump officials sought to strip the network and its parent agency of their independence during his first term, including actions later found to be illegal and in one case, unconstitutional .\n\nBut Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally install Lake; the hire is dependent on a bipartisan board beneath the chief executive of its parent agency.\n\nVoice of America (VOA), which is funded by Congress , operates in nearly 50 languages and reaches an estimated 354 million people weekly across the globe. It is part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the government agency that oversees all non-military, U.S. international broadcasting.\n\nTrump said Wednesday on Truth Social that Lake will be appointed by and work closely with the incoming head of that agency, \"who I will announce soon.\"\n\nA free press is central to VOA's mission: It aims to bring unfettered reporting to places that do not have it, and show political debate and dissent in the U.S. even when that reflects critically on the administration in power.\n\nTrump's White House took the unprecedented step in spring 2020 of openly attacking VOA in public statements over its perceived failures to explicitly blame the Chinese government for the pandemic.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump wrote that Lake and his as-yet-unnamed agency leader will \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\"\n\nLake, who ran unsuccessfully for an Arizona U.S. Senate seat this year and for governor in 2022, has made a political name for herself in part by denying election losses (both hers and Trump's in 2020) and railing against the mainstream media, of which she was once a part.\n\nShe left her job at the Phoenix Fox affiliate in 2021 after over two decades and a series of controversies , including sharing COVID-19 misinformation during the pandemic.\n\nIn her speech at the Republican National Convention this summer, Lake accused the \"fake news\" of spending \"the last eight years lying about President Donald Trump and his amazing, patriotic supporters,\" and said they had \"worn out your welcome.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Lake said she looks forward to starting at VOA, which she described as a \"vital international media outlet dedicated to advancing the interests of the United States by engaging directly with people across the globe and promoting democracy and truth.\"\n\n\"Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America's achievements worldwide,\" Lake tweeted .\n\nThat's not exactly the organization's stated mission, however. On its website, it says it is \"committed to providing comprehensive coverage of the news and telling audiences the truth.\"\n\nVOA was founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda in Germany.\n\n\"We bring you Voices from America,\" said announcer William Harlan Hale in the first German-language program . \"Today, and daily from now on, we shall speak to you about America and the war. The news may be good for us. The news may be bad. But we shall tell you the truth.\"\n\nBy the end of World War II, it was broadcasting 3,200 programs in 40 languages every week, presenting America - and modeling a free press - to the world.\n\nVOA was able to continue and even expand its operations during the Cold War. And when the United States Information Agency was established in 1953, VOA became its largest element.\n\nToday, its over 2,000 employees produce radio, digital and television content, distributed by a network of satellite, cable, FM and MW and some 3,500 affiliate stations.\n\nVOA calls itself the largest U.S. international broadcaster; others include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Radio Martí.\n\nThe Voice of America building stands in Washington, D.C. Andrew Harnik/AP hide caption\n\nFrom its beginning, government officials debated the balance VOA should strike between reporting the news and furthering U.S. foreign policy. Over the years, the broadcaster has taken several steps to safeguard its editorial independence, in practice and in policy.\n\nIn the late 1950s, VOA employees drafted a formal statement of principles to protect the editorial integrity of their broadcasts, which became the official VOA Charter in 1960. President Gerald Ford signed it into law in 1976 .\n\nThere are three main guidelines: VOA news will be \"accurate, objective and comprehensive;\" \"represent America, not any single segment of American society\" and cover not only U.S. policies but \"responsible discussions and opinion\" about them.\n\nTaking a step further, the 1994 U.S. International Broadcasting Act enshrined in U.S. code a \"firewall\" that prohibits any U.S. government official from interfering in the objective, independent reporting of news.\n\n\"The firewall ensures that VOA can make the final decisions on what stories to cover, and how they are covered,\" the broadcaster says.\n\nThat firewall came under threat during the first Trump administration, as NPR has reported .\n\nDespite the VOA being owned by the federal government, the White House singled it out for attack during the first Trump administration, particularly during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020.\n\nThe White House accused the broadcaster of amplifying Chinese government propaganda about the country's efforts to contain the virus, which it denied.\n\nIt was in that context that the Republican-led Senate finally confirmed conservative filmmaker Michael Pack to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media, two years after Trump first nominated him.\n\nPack's arrival rattled VOA even before he got there: Two top officials resigned as soon as he was confirmed.\n\nFurther fueling fears of political interference , Pack quickly stripped most of the agency's senior leadership of their authority and fired the chiefs of the government-sponsored broadcast networks for foreign audiences, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.\n\n\"My job really is to drain the swamp, to root out corruption and to deal with these issues of bias, not to tell journalists what to report,\" Pack told the pro-Trump website The Federalist at the time.\n\nThroughout his seven-month tenure at VOA's parent agency, Pack faced multiple accusations of meddling in its process - from making personnel moves like reassigning VOA leaders and refusing to extend foreign employees' work visas, to editorial decisions like removing several controversial stories from its website after publication.\n\nUnder Pack's leadership, the agency also investigated one of its own VOA White House reporters for perceived anti-Trump bias and rescinded the firewall meant to ensure editorial independence from partisan interference.\n\nA formal federal investigation also said Pack engaged in \"waste or gross waste of government resources\" in paying a private firm $1.6 million to investigate agency executives he considered insufficiently loyal (they were ultimately exonerated). Such work is ordinarily done by government attorneys.\n\nThe Biden administration swiftly removed several Trump loyalists from the U.S. Agency for Global Media and VOA itself after taking office in 2021. A federal inquiry released in 2023 found that Pack repeatedly engaged in abuses of power and gross mismanagement - including, but not limited to, violating journalists' independence. A federal judge found that Pack had violated constitutional free speech protections of the network's journalists.\n\nThe chaos of the Pack era led to congressional reform - most notably, the creation of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board (IBAB).\n\nThe IBAB is an independent federal entity made up of seven people: six experts in mass communications and international affairs, appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and a seat for the secretary of state. No more than three of the president's appointees can be from the same political party.\n\nThe Senate confirmed its six new members last December.\n\nThe board's stated mission is to ensure the editorial independence and enhance the impact of the work carried out by the U.S Agency for Global Media. It also plays a role in the appointment and removal of heads of the agency's entities.\n\nThe heads of VOA and others \"may only be appointed or removed if such action has been approved by the Board,\" according to its bylaws .\n\nNotably, VOA welcomed a new director - former Freedom House president and longtime Washington Post reporter and editor Michael Abramowitz - in June.\n\n\"As I have said many times, I welcome a smooth transition of power for both USAGM and VOA,\" Abramowitz wrote Thursday in an email to staff. \"I intend to cooperate with the new administration and follow the process put in place by Congress for the appointment of the Director of VOA.\"\n\nIt's not clear when or whether the board would meet to decide to replace Abramowitz. Trump has not yet said whom he intends to appoint to lead the parent U.S. Agency for Global Media, a position that requires Senate confirmation.\n\nThe board has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Voice of America staff sue Trump administration for shutting down network\n\nDavid Folkenflik\n\nStaff at the government broadcaster Voice of America have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, which put nearly 900 employees on leave and froze funding last week. BONNIE CASH/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption\n\nSix Voice of America journalists sued Kari Lake and the Trump administration on Friday, alleging their moves to shut down the U.S.-funded network were unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nThe journalists say that the government's acts violate their First Amendment rights on free speech grounds and usurp the U.S. Congress's control of the power of the federal purse.\n\nMore than 900 full-time network employees were placed on indefinite leave last weekend; 550 contractors were terminated from their jobs. Most employees at the federal parent, U.S. Agency for Global Media, were also placed on indefinite leave.\n\nThe lead plaintiffs include Patsy Widakuswara, until recently Voice of America's White House bureau chief and Jessica Jerreat, its press freedom editor. Four other journalists sued anonymously as John Does. Kathryn Neeper, the director of strategy and performance assessment at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, is also a named plaintiff. She was also placed on leave.\n\nFew Voice of America journalists are known inside the U.S.; the network is prohibited from broadcasting to American audiences. Nonetheless, Widakuswara made headlines twice: First in pressing Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in early 2021 over the siege of the U.S. Capitol and, earlier this month, in asking Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin about \"the president's plans to expel Palestinians from Gaza\" at an appearance with President Trump at the White House.\n\nIrritated, Trump asked Widakuswara what outlet she worked for. Upon hearing the answer, he replied, \"No wonder,\" and called on another reporter.\n\nLake is Trump's special adviser overseeing USAGM. \"Waste, fraud, and abuse run rampant in this agency and American taxpayers shouldn't have to fund it,\" Lake said in announcing the moves last weekend .\n\nThe effect was to shut Voice of America down. The most recent stories on its home page and its audio headlines feed are a week old; live streaming services are unavailable.\n\nThe suit, which additionally names acting USAGM Chief Executive Victor Morales as a defendant, seeks immediate reinstatement of all full-time staffers and contractors. It points to regulations and law which specify a firewall to insulate Voice of America and the other international networks funded by the agency from political tampering. Those measures are intended to ensure their professionalism.\n\n\"Tragically, Kari Lake lives in the MAGA fantasy world, but she makes decisions that have real-world consequences for hundreds of journalists,\" said David Seide, the lead attorney on the suit. Seide is senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project, a non-profit that seeks to protect the rights of whistleblowers.\n\n\"We've assembled a coalition of journalists, unions, and advocacy groups to stop and reverse the DOGE machine,\" Seide added. Among the other backers of the suit are the press-rights group Reporters Without Borders and unions representing federal employees, journalists, and foreign policy staffers.\n\nLake gave this one-sentence reply to a request for comment for this story: \"Kari Lake does not grant interviews or interact with disreputable 'news' outlets like NPR.\" She has not responded to prior efforts seeking interviews.\n\nMorales and the agency itself did not respond.\n\nCongress has appropriated funds for the Voice of America every year since the broadcaster's founding during World War II. Lawmakers allocated additional money for the broadcaster and other federally funded networks as part of the stopgap spending measure passed last week.\n\nIn addition to Voice of America, the U.S. Agency for Global Media also oversees Radio/TV Martí, which broadcasts to Cuba. The agency also disburses the money Congress allocates for privately incorporated networks - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks - as well as the Open Technology Fund, which propels the open-source tech undergirding Signal and other secure communication programs.\n\nThe networks are intended to serve as a demonstration of soft power in places without a robust or free press. By providing news that incorporates political debate and dissent inside the U.S., the networks aim to promote and model pluralistic American ideals.\n\nAccording to the agency, the networks together reach more than 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week. They are fully funded by federal dollars.\n\nThe withholding of federal dollars from the non-profit broadcasters has had immediate repercussions. Radio Free Asia on Friday furloughed three-quarters of its U.S.-based staff as it burns through the remaining money it has; Steve Capus, the chief executive of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty told NPR's Leila Fadel this week that without a restoration of funds, the network would face \"pretty drastic actions.\"\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty sued Lake and the Trump administration earlier this week; the Open Tech Fund filed suit Thursday. Their suits were filed in the District of Columbia; the Voice of America plaintiffs sued in federal court in Manhattan.\n\nThe lawsuits are a replay of the litigation that ensued during Trump's first term. His pick to run USAGM, Michael Pack, sought to overhaul the agency. His tenure was marked by one controversy after another ; a formal federal investigation found that he had abused his powers.\n\nSoon after taking office in mid-2020, Pack sought to deny work visas for foreign nationals employed by the network.\n\nIn the newest litigation against Lake, Morales and USAGM, two of the unnamed plaintiffs are described as freelance journalists working under contract to VOA. Each is said in the lawsuit to be a foreign national authorized to work in the U.S. under a J-1 visa; their visas will expire on March 31 if their visas are not renewed and the agency is not operational once more. In that case, they would have to return to their home countries.\n\nJohn Doe 3 would return to a nation under rule by an authoritarian regime that has labeled Voice of America a \"subversive organization,\" according to the lawsuit; the plaintiff risks imprisonment for 15 years.\n\nJohn Doe 4 is described as \"a member of the LGBTQ community and is from a home country which persecutes and discriminates against LGBTQ people.\"\n\nLake, a former local TV news anchor in Phoenix, ran twice for statewide office in Arizona as a MAGA Republican candidate. She lost both times. Last month, she became a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media.\n\nTrump initially touted her as the next director of Voice of America but his top budget-slashing adviser, Elon Musk, and other administration officials called for the network to be shut down altogether.\n\nLake has since embraced that charge.\n\n\"From top-to-bottom this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer-a national security risk for this nation-and irretrievably broken,\" the agency said in its release last Saturday . \"While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "A bane for tyrants abroad, U.S.-funded networks fear fate under Kari Lake\n\nDavid Folkenflik\n\nKari Lake, U.S. President Donald Trump's choice to lead Voice of America, is shown speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort Hotel And Convention Center on Feb. 21, 2025 in Oxon Hill, Maryland. Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nA month ago, Elon Musk called for Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to be shut down, tweeting : \"It's just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.\"\n\nIt's in keeping with Musk's DOGE initiative, prompting the administration to slash jobs, cut programs and even seek to sever funds for contracts already in progress throughout the federal government.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump administration officials have asserted greater control over the Voice of America's parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Several DOGE aides have been sent to the agency, which has commenced an initial batch of firings of probationary employees at Voice of America. And leaders at other U.S.-funded networks that broadcast overseas fear Musk's grander wish - for a full shutdown - may be coming true.\n\nThose outlets include such storied networks as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, started up to counter Communist propaganda.\n\nThese institutions, unlike the government-owned Voice of America, are separate not-for-profit entities. Yet they are fully funded by the U.S. government through the same federal parent agency.\n\nWere the government to withhold money for any appreciable length of time, \"We would bleed out,\" an official at one of the international broadcast networks said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal.\n\n(NPR has no affiliation with the U.S. Agency for Global Media and typically receives about 1% of its annual budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.)\n\nThis account is based on interviews with 12 people with knowledge of developments at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which is the federal agency that oversees all these international broadcasters and distributes money to them. All spoke on condition they not be named for fear of recrimination, given the backdrop of government firings and budget cuts. The agency did not reply to two requests for comment for this story.\n\nThe networks' mission is to deliver news coverage and cultural programming to places where a free press is threatened or doesn't exist. They are also designed as a form of soft diplomacy, by modeling independent journalism that incorporates dissent from government policy. Together, according to the agency, the networks reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week.\n\nThat comes with diplomatic complications. The reporting of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has vexed autocratic-minded leaders in Russia and Hungary as well as their allies. The networks' journalists have been imprisoned or detained in Russian-controlled Crimea, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Russia itself .\n\nThe network's Farda news service reports intensely on life in Iran and is a thorn in the side of the regime there. The Iranian government, a sworn enemy of the U.S. and frequent irritant to President Trump, is allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In December, the regime sentenced former Radio Farda reporter Reza Valizadeh to 10 years in prison for \"cooperating with a hostile government.\"\n\n\"Clearly, this regime feels threatened by the forces of freedom, including independent journalism,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty chief Steve Capus said at the time. \"It's why Radio Farda's mission of providing uncensored news and other programming to the Iranian people is more important than ever. Journalism is not a crime.\"\n\nSimilarly, Radio Free Asia's reports on the oppression of Uighur Muslims by Chinese authorities helped to bring their plight to international attention. In 2020, North Korean officials executed the owner of a fishing fleet for secretly listening to broadcasts by Radio Free Asia while at sea, the network reported . Authorities brought in 100 of his peers to watch the execution as a warning of the dangers of tuning in.\n\nAccording to six people with knowledge, officials at the international broadcasters are closely monitoring deep cuts at the U.S. State Department to international relief efforts for which money has already been contracted. (Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.)\n\nThey also see parallels to the financial crisis at the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit organization that awards grants to strengthen democracy in 100 countries. Like the networks, it receives a direct appropriation annually from Congress.\n\nThe endowment is suing the Trump administration , saying the White House has unlawfully withheld nearly $240 million in congressionally approved funding, the bulk of it already obligated.\n\nNo concrete proof of such broad intentions at USAGM has publicly surfaced. The question of whether the agency could cut off funding for the networks is further complicated by two countervailing facts: Congress directly appropriates money for them, granting the agency only a small degree of latitude to redirect funds; on the other hand, Congress has not passed a budget for the current year in progress, and the current stop-gap measure is set to run out on Friday.\n\nTrump has announced he wants Kari Lake , a former Phoenix local TV news anchor turned two-time unsuccessful MAGA political candidate, to be the next director of Voice of America; hers, by law, is not a presidential appointment. She legally must await the Senate confirmation of Trump's pick to lead USAGM - the conservative media critic Brent Bozell III . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not yet set a date for a confirmation hearing. Then Lake has to be approved by a bipartisan board overseeing the network; the White House fired its members upon Trump taking office .\n\nIn the meantime, Lake is helping to lead the agency as a senior adviser to Trump. She has made conciliatory remarks to the journalists and networks in her official communications, while signaling changes and cuts may be in store.\n\n\"I understand the challenges faced by those who cover news both in front of and behind the camera, and I have immense respect for the men and women who do the job with honesty and integrity,\" Lake wrote in a memo to staff obtained by NPR.\n\n\"Sadly, journalism is experiencing dark days right now,\" she continued. \"The public has lost almost all trust in the media. For those reading this - it is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet.\"\n\n\"I am committed to quickly reforming and modernizing the agency into something the American people are willing to support,\" she wrote.\n\nIn outside statements, Lake has been blunter. \"We won't become Trump TV,\" she said at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month , \"but it sure as hell will not be 'TDS TV.' You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, 60 Minutes , The Washington Post and The New York Times .\"\n\nThat said, journalists throughout the agency's networks say she has not met to talk substance or her plans with their newsrooms or senior executives. (They spoke on condition of anonymity given a climate of fear.)\n\nFollowing the DOGE playbook, the U.S. Agency for Global Media has demanded that agency and VOA employees give weekly updates of their accomplishments, in correspondence reviewed by NPR. Several VOA staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fears of repercussions, say there have been offers of buyouts, which they believe will be followed by broader layoffs.\n\nIn addition, the agency has also fired nine journalists at Voice of America who held probationary status. The agency also fired two journalists from the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which is similarly fully owned by the U.S. government and runs Radio and TV Martí. The agency did so over the objections of Voice of America's senior management, according to three people with knowledge of events, speaking on condition they not be named for fear of reprisal. Voice of America did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nOstap Yarysh, a host and correspondent for the Ukrainian language service of the Voice of America, was among those fired. He tells NPR that he was pulled in a few hours before his show last Thursday and told not to do any more work. Yarysh says the network hired him as a contractor in 2019, but promoted him in 2023 to a full-time employee. He says he was still in the last legs of a two-year probationary period, and hence vulnerable.\n\n\"I was given no notice, basically,\" Yarysh says. \"There's speculation this was political retribution. I don't think that was the case. It was just a probationary employee directive and they got everyone.\"\n\nHe said the U.S. Agency for Global Media first tried to fire him two weeks earlier but Voice of America leaders objected, designating him as an employee critical to its mission. This time, Yarysh says, he received a termination notice saying he had not been designated as mission-critical - despite what news executives at Voice of America said.\n\nDuring the final year of Trump's first presidential term, his appointee as chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media similarly tried to upend it and its networks. Many of the efforts of then-CEO Michael Pack were overturned in court and found to have broken laws.\n\nPack's acting vice president of legal, compliance and risk was cited by a 2023 federal investigative report as having failed to observe federal law in several instances. That executive, Mora Namdar, wrote the chapter on USAGM and international broadcasting in Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation's suggested blueprint for Trump's second term. Though Trump disavowed it during the campaign, many of his administration's actions have closely hewed to its suggestions.\n\nIn her chapter for Project 2025, Namdar called for consolidation of many of the foreign language services, stricter scrutiny of visas for journalists who are citizens of other countries, and the scrapping of many \"firewall\" provisions intended to protect the journalists who work for the networks from political meddling.\n\nIn fall 2020, Pack assigned two political appointees at the agency to investigate senior White House correspondent Steve Herman ; it was decried as a witch hunt and found by a federal judge to be an unconstitutional breach of the firewall's free speech protections. Similarly, in early 2021, veteran reporter Patsy Widakuswara had been shifted from her assignment after pressing then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the January 6th siege of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Herman, was suspended and is being once more investigated over his social media posts of articles critical of the Trump administration. The network also reassigned Widakuswara from her beat covering the White House.\n\nBoth moves were said to have been done by the network's news leaders, not political appointees at the agency; VOA's director, Michael Abramowitz is a veteran editor at the Washington Post and former head of Freedom House, the free speech and journalism advocacy organization.\n\nAs of this month, Namdar appears to be back on board, spotted last week at USAGM, according to four people with knowledge who spoke on condition they not be named, citing fear of retribution. Namdar is said to be advising Lake.\n\nUSAGM did not respond to NPR's questions about Namdar's role at the agency.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

First, there's a question whether he can even do that. And second, it's a pointed choice for the federally owned news outlet, which broadcasts internationally and prizes its independent journalism. NPR's David Folkenflik covered the Voice of America during the first Trump administration. Hi, David. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Kari Lake's been in the news for several years now. Remind listeners who she is. FOLKENFLIK: Sure. She's a two-time Republican candidate for major office back in her home state of Arizona. She lost both times. She ran for governor. She ran this year for senator - wrapped herself in the MAGA mantle, embraced the lies that there had somehow been election frauds in her race, in the race for - that President-elect Trump lost to President Biden back in 2020. She's a former local TV anchor. Interestingly, she embraced Obama publicly before she made this hard swing to Trump. But I think a key element is that she has rhetorically been, despite her professional background, on the attack against the press and condemned it as offering - much like President-elect Trump himself - fake news. SHAPIRO: So tell us more about Voice of America and why Trump might want Lake to lead it. FOLKENFLIK: Sure. So the Voice of America is not well-known in this country, but it's really well-known abroad. It broadcasts in nearly 50 languages across the globe. It reaches its - an estimated 345-350 million people each week. It provides real news, and it's providing it often to places that don't have a robust and free press operating itself. So it's modeling democratic - small D - democratic pluralistic values by providing real news and showing what a free press does, which is it includes dissent and domestic debate even when it doesn't reflect great on whoever's in government at that moment. Why Trump wants Lake to lead the Voice of America is to bring it to heel. SHAPIRO: And you covered what happened to Voice of America during Trump's first term. How did it change during that administration? FOLKENFLIK: Well, the amazing thing is, although it's, you know, an asset of the American government's sort of soft diplomacy, Trump viewed it as part of the press and attacked it as doing fake news, particularly in his last year during - in the first months of the pandemic - attacking it as somehow doing propaganda on behalf of the Chinese Communist government, for not, in those early months, more directly blaming the Chinese government for the outbreak of COVID-19. What you then saw later that spring, after a guy named Michael Pack was confirmed to lead Voice of America's parent agency - it's called the U.S. Agency for Global Media - was a series of acts that were later found to be illegal and even, in one case, found to be unconstitutional. They tried to dismiss a bunch of executives. They instituted loyalty tests for journalists way down in the - you know, in the weeds, going through their social media accounts to see if they had even just linked to stories that were negative about the Trump administration and in another case, assigning a White House reporter who had the temerity to ask then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the January 6, 2021 assault on Congress. So it was a - both an attack rhetorically on the independence of it as a news outlet and on the professionalism of the civil service of people who aren't political appointees. SHAPIRO: Does the president actually have the power to name VOA's director? It's part of a larger agency. FOLKENFLIK: Right. So actually, under reforms passed in 2020, it appears not. It's got to be done with the, you know, assent and affirmation of the head of that U.S. Agency for Global Media and a bipartisan board. But two things to point out. One is we don't know what Trump's going to try to do to that board or what laws he's going to try to ignore, as he did at the end of his first term when it came to the Voice of America. And secondly, he's offering a clear broadside against the idea of the independence of Voice of America and, by extension, its sister networks operating internationally.

What you then saw later that spring, after a guy named Michael Pack was confirmed to lead Voice of America's parent agency - it's called the U.S. Agency for Global Media - was a series of acts that were later found to be illegal and even, in one case, found to be unconstitutional. They tried to dismiss a bunch of executives. They instituted loyalty tests for journalists way down in the - you know, in the weeds, going through their social media accounts to see if they had even just linked to stories that were negative about the Trump administration and in another case, assigning a White House reporter who had the temerity to ask then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the January 6, 2021 assault on Congress. So it was a - both an attack rhetorically on the independence of it as a news outlet and on the professionalism of the civil service of people who aren't political appointees. SHAPIRO: Does the president actually have the power to name VOA's director? It's part of a larger agency. FOLKENFLIK: Right. So actually, under reforms passed in 2020, it appears not. It's got to be done with the, you know, assent and affirmation of the head of that U.S. Agency for Global Media and a bipartisan board. But two things to point out. One is we don't know what Trump's going to try to do to that board or what laws he's going to try to ignore, as he did at the end of his first term when it came to the Voice of America. And secondly, he's offering a clear broadside against the idea of the independence of Voice of America and, by extension, its sister networks operating internationally.

She ran for governor. She ran this year for senator - wrapped herself in the MAGA mantle, embraced the lies that there had somehow been election frauds in her race, in the race for - that President-elect Trump lost to President Biden back in 2020. She's a former local TV anchor. Interestingly, she embraced Obama publicly before she made this hard swing to Trump. But I think a key element is that she has rhetorically been, despite her professional background, on the attack against the press and condemned it as offering - much like President-elect Trump himself - fake news. SHAPIRO: So tell us more about Voice of America and why Trump might want Lake to lead it. FOLKENFLIK: Sure. So the Voice of America is not well-known in this country, but it's really well-known abroad. It broadcasts in nearly 50 languages across the globe. It reaches its - an estimated 345-350 million people each week. It provides real news, and it's providing it often to places that don't have a robust and free press operating itself. So it's modeling democratic - small D - democratic pluralistic values by providing real news and showing what a free press does, which is it includes dissent and domestic debate even when it doesn't reflect great on whoever's in government at that moment. Why Trump wants Lake to lead the Voice of America is to bring it to heel. SHAPIRO: And you covered what happened to Voice of America during Trump's first term.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nSHAPIRO: And you covered what happened to Voice of America during Trump's first term. How did it change during that administration? FOLKENFLIK: Well, the amazing thing is, although it's, you know, an asset of the American government's sort of soft diplomacy, Trump viewed it as part of the press and attacked it as doing fake news, particularly in his last year during - in the first months of the pandemic - attacking it as somehow doing propaganda on behalf of the Chinese Communist government, for not, in those early months, more directly blaming the Chinese government for the outbreak of COVID-19. What you then saw later that spring, after a guy named Michael Pack was confirmed to lead Voice of America's parent agency - it's called the U.S. Agency for Global Media - was a series of acts that were later found to be illegal and even, in one case, found to be unconstitutional. They tried to dismiss a bunch of executives. They instituted loyalty tests for journalists way down in the - you know, in the weeds, going through their social media accounts to see if they had even just linked to stories that were negative about the Trump administration and in another case, assigning a White House reporter who had the temerity to ask then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the January 6, 2021 assault on Congress. So it was a - both an attack rhetorically on the independence of it as a news outlet and on the professionalism of the civil service of people who aren't political appointees. SHAPIRO: Does the president actually have the power to name VOA's director? It's part of a larger agency. FOLKENFLIK: Right. So actually, under reforms passed in 2020, it appears not. It's got to be done with the, you know, assent and affirmation of the head of that U.S. Agency for Global Media and a bipartisan board. But two things to point out. One is we don't know what Trump's going to try to do to that board or what laws he's going to try to ignore, as he did at the end of his first term when it came to the Voice of America. And secondly, he's offering a clear broadside against the idea of the independence of Voice of America and, by extension, its sister networks operating internationally.

Jon Cherry/Getty Images hide caption\n\nDemocrat Ruben Gallego has won the U.S. Senate race in Arizona, defeating Republican Kari Lake, according to a race call by the Associated Press.\n\nGallego, who's served in Congress for the last decade, is the latest Democrat to win a key race in Arizona, following a sweep of the top three statewide offices in 2022 and President Biden's narrow victory here in 2020.\n\nGallego led in the polls for much of his race against Lake, a MAGA firebrand who's yet to concede her 2022 gubernatorial loss and now faces another bitter defeat in a state where voters seem to have soured on MAGA candidates - save for former President Donald Trump himself.\n\nLoading...\n\nGallego will replace outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who declined to run what was seen as a longshot campaign for reelection after she defected from the Democratic Party in 2022 and declared herself an independent.\n\nBut Gallego didn't wait for Sinema's decision, and has been running for the Senate seat for nearly the last two years.\n\nThat time gave him a leg up on Lake, who declared her own candidacy a little over a year ago. Political analysts in Arizona say she failed to reintroduce herself to voters after her failed 2022 campaign, instead running the race in the same combative style - rife with election denialism and fealty to Trump - as she did four years ago.\n\nAnd Gallego hammered Lake for her past comments in support of strict, near-total abortion bans in Arizona - laws that proved unpopular with voters who also approved a constitutional right to abortion, also on the ballot this year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "'Bloody Saturday' at Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks\n\nDavid Folkenflik\n\nPresident Trump's late-night decree Friday led to orders gutting the Voice of America and other U.S.-funded international broadcasters. Andrew Harnik/AP hide caption\n\nJournalists showed up at the Voice of America today to broadcast their programs only to be told they had been locked out: Federal officials had embarked on indefinite mass suspensions.\n\nAll full-time staffers at the Voice of America and the Office for Cuba Broadcasting, which runs Radio and Television Martí , were affected - more than 1,000 employees. The move followed a late Friday night edict from President Trump that its parent agency, called the U.S. Agency for Global Media, must eliminate all activities that are not required by law.\n\nIn addition, under the leadership of Trump appointees, the agency has severed all contracts for the privately incorporated international broadcasters it funds, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.\n\nThe termination notices for grants for the funded networks, two of which were reviewed by NPR, carried the signature of Trump's senior adviser Kari Lake , whom he placed at USAGM, not the agency's acting chief executive. Lake does not appear in her current job to have the statutory authority to carry out that termination.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened that for the 1st time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" the network's director, Michael Abramowitz, said in a statement posted on his personal Facebook account. \"VOA needs thoughtful reform and we have made progress in that regard. But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission.\" He wrote that he was among those 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff put on leave.\n\nGrant Turner, the former chief financial officer at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, called it \"Bloody Saturday\" for the agency and its networks.\n\n\"From what I hear, this is shaping up to be a really sad day. USAGM networks share important news, information and American values around the world,\" Turner said. \"It took decades to build this goodwill and an audience of hundreds of millions every week. Seeing arsonists just set fire to it all is awful.\"\n\n\"The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's grant agreement would be a massive gift to America's enemies,\" Steve Capus, the president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said in a statement today shared with NPR. \"The Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years. Handing our adversaries a win would make them stronger and America weaker. We've benefitted from strong bipartisan support throughout RFE/RL's storied history. Without us, the nearly 50 million people in closed societies who depend on us for accurate news and information each week won't have access to the truth about America and the world.\"\n\nThis story is based on interviews with 16 current and former employees of the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the networks it funds. Almost all spoke on condition they not be named due to fear of professional retribution. NPR has reviewed internal notifications about the suspensions and the killed contracts.  Similar notices reviewed by NPR have been received by hundreds of contractors at the Voice of America as well today.\n\nUSAGM and the White House did not reply to requests for comment. A deputy White House spokesperson tweeted \"Goodbye\" in 20 languages over a link to a story from 2023 over a controversy at the Voice of America about how to characterize Hamas.\n\nTaken together, the federally-funded broadcasters and their sister networks covering the Middle East and Cuba reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week, according to the agency. They are fully funded by federal dollars.\n\nThe networks' mission is to deliver news coverage and cultural programming to places where a free press is threatened or doesn't exist. They are also designed as a form of soft diplomacy, modeling independent journalism that incorporates dissent from government policy.\n\nThe Voice of America sparked Trump's ire in his first term in office over reporting on Covid-19. His appointee as chief executive for U.S. Agency for Global Media embarked on a series of suspensions, visa revocations and investigations that were found, in some instances, to violate the law and federal policy .\n\nThis time, Trump's budget-slashing adviser, Elon Musk, and other administration officials have called for Voice of America and some of the sister networks to be shut down . The scope and legality of these acts are not yet in full focus , but they appear to be designed to gut them and place whatever coverage survives under tighter control of politically appointed officials.\n\nTrump placed Lake, a two-time unsuccessful MAGA candidate, as his senior adviser over USAGM . She did not reply to a detailed request for comment for this story. USAGM's media relations team has not replied to NPR's repeated and detailed requests for comment about developments at the networks in recent days, including today. Trump's pick to lead the agency permanently, the conservative media critic L. Brent Bozell III , has not yet been scheduled for confirmation hearings in the U.S. Senate.\n\nVoice of America and its sister networks have come in for criticism on specific editorial judgments. The U.S. Agency for Global Media, wrote Dan Robinson, a retired 34-year veteran of Voice of America and the agency, \"has essentially become a hubris-filled rogue operation often reflecting a leftist bias aligned with partisan national media.\"\n\n\"It has sought to avoid accountability for violations of journalistic standards and mismanagement,\" he continued in his essay , published in November in the conservative Washington Times.\n\nThe broadcasters' reporting has angered some powerful figures abroad, including those who have close links to Trump.\n\nThe reporting of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, for example, has vexed autocratic-minded leaders in Russia and Hungary, as well as their allies. The network's journalists have been imprisoned or detained in Russian-controlled Crimea, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Russia itself .\n\nTrump has struck warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Premier Viktor Orbán.\n\nSimilarly, Radio Free Asia's reports on the oppression of Uighur Muslims by Chinese authorities helped to bring their plight to international attention. In 2020, North Korean officials executed the owner of a fishing fleet for secretly listening to broadcasts by Radio Free Asia while at sea, the network reported . Authorities brought in 100 of his peers to watch the execution as a warning of the dangers of tuning in.\n\nA reporter for the English language Shanghai Daily , controlled by the Chinese Communist party, exulted at the developments: \"EXCELLENT NEWS,\" Andy Boreham tweeted. He called Radio Free Asia \"one of the US's most insidious anti-China propaganda outlets.\"\n\nDespite strong criticism from Trump administration officials and their allies on Capitol Hill, the networks have largely won strong bipartisan support over the years.\n\nU.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, the Republican former chairperson of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said in a statement to NPR earlier this week that he appreciated the ability of USAGM networks to disseminate information in China that the ruling Chinese Communist party censors sought to block there.\n\n\"That's why I strongly support many of its programs,\" McCaul said. \"Programs like [Radio Free Asia] provide day-to-day updates on far-off regions, uphold a free press even in authoritarian countries, and ensure Americans-and people everywhere-are not subject to our adversaries' propaganda.\"\n\nThe suspended staffers include reporters, editors, managers - journalists in the English-language core newsroom in Washington D.C. and those offering coverage and programs in dozens of languages serving audiences across the globe. The memos informing recipients that they can no longer perform their jobs say the action was not being done \"for any disciplinary purpose.\"\n\nEmployees at the U.S. Agency for Global Media also received the notification, technically an indefinite leave \"with full pay and benefits until otherwise notified,\" ordering the cessation of all work related activities and the surrender of all government property, including devices and records.\n\nThree staffers for DOGE, the government cost-slashing initiative led by Musk, have been camped out at the agency gaining access to its budget, social media and other activities, according to several people with knowledge. (They spoke anonymously due to potential professional repercussions.)\n\nIn recent days, administration officials had already taken actions that placed severe pressure on the ability of the networks to function.\n\nThe agency had cut contracts with major news services, including the Associated Press, Agence France Presse, and Reuters, which is used to supplement the broadcasters' reporting.\n\nIt had withheld money needed by Radio Free Asia to meet payroll, triggering the prospect of furloughs there, as first reported by Politico . Freelancers tell NPR they haven't been paid since last month because the aides assigned to USAGM from DOGE have frozen funds.\n\nAnd Lake ratcheted up the pressure with her own rhetoric.\n\nOn Friday evening, before Trump's order, Lake posted a video of the new headquarters for USAGM and the Voice of America to argue that it's an exemplar of profligate spending.\n\n\"I'm sitting here on the 13th floor of a shiny, brand-new beautiful skyscraper building that is costing you, the taxpayer, a fortune,\" Lake said , as camera footage lingered over features including glass walls, interior waterfalls, and modern conference rooms. \"Here's the kicker: They already have a building that they're located in, that is paid off, that they could have renovated or updated.\"\n\nFormer USAGM CFO Grant Turner says she's got it backwards. According to the USAGM's announcement last September , the lease, thanks to a slow real estate market caused by the pandemic, stands to save the federal government $150 million over 15 years.\n\n\"That's a bunch of lies and misinformation coming out of her mouth,\" said Turner, who left the agency in January. \"In fact, it's probably one of the best deals struck by a tenant in D.C. history.\"\n\nFour USAGM and Voice of America staffers backed up Turner's account on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retribution in the current climate. For one thing, they note, the new building is not new. It's nearly two decades old - built in 2006 , according to the general contractor on the project. For another, the old building wasn't \"paid off\" - the agency doesn't own it. The agency got three years in free rent at the new headquarters, and was drawing staffers out of the old Wilbur J. Cohen building, they said, thus sizeably reducing its footprint and rent paid to the federal government.\n\nAnd the new building's landlord gave $27 million toward the construction of state-of-the-art studios. That would have been necessary in the technologically archaic Cohen building - absent the existential question now hovering over the networks.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Kari Lake wins Arizona's GOP Senate primary. She'll face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego\n\nBy\n\nBen Giles\n\nRepublican Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake waves to supporters as she arrives on stage after being declared her party's primary winner on Tuesday in Phoenix. Ross D. Franklin/AP hide caption\n\nArizonans have chosen Kari Lake, an election denying ally of former President Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in a race that could determine control of the chamber this fall, according to a race call by The Associated Press.\n\nWith results from early voting reported, Lake led with approximately 54% of the GOP primary vote, well more than the roughly 40% held by her rival, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and a distant third challenger, Elizabeth Reye. Lake's margin of victory may change as more votes are counted.\n\nAt an election night rally in Phoenix after her race was called, Lake told a crowd of supporters that Arizonans had less than three-and-a-half months to save the country alongside Trump.\n\n\"He can't do this alone,\" Lake said. \"He needs backup in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nSomeone in the crowd shouted, \"He needs Kari Lake!\"\n\n\"He needs backup in Washington, D.C. and I'm gonna be his backup!\" Lake added.\n\nShe'll face Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, who ran unopposed for his party's nomination to the Senate seat now filled by retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nLoading...\n\nLake has been a MAGA Republican ever since launching her political career with a failed campaign for governor of Arizona in 2022. While running for the Senate, Lake continues to deny her loss to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, and earlier this month filed yet another lawsuit seeking to have the outcome of that gubernatorial race overturned - and have herself instated as governor.\n\nHer persistent election denialism may have helped her receive the support of Trump, who swiftly endorsed Lake when she entered the U.S. Senate race last fall. But it's considered a weakness by some Arizona Republicans who worry she'll lose another statewide race this fall to Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who's consistently led Lake in polls thus far.\n\nHer shifting position on abortion has also come under fire from Democrats in a state grappling with a ballot measure to enshrine the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution this fall.\n\nIn April, Lake denounced an Arizona Supreme Court ruling reviving a near-total ban on abortion in the state - a law she previously praised as a gubernatorial candidate, when she said she was \"thrilled\" Arizona would have the ban on the books in the event the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"From now until November, I welcome all Arizonans - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike - to join our team and help defeat Kari Lake and her dangerous plan to ban abortion and hurt Arizonans,\" Gallego said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nGallego has been a fierce ally of the abortion ballot measure in Arizona, and has vowed to abolish the Senate's filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nAt times during her victory speech on Tuesday, Lake sought to strike a collaborative tone, calling on \"Trump Republicans\" and \"traditional Republicans\" alike to join together to support her.\n\nAnd she also made overtures to conservatives, independents, Libertarians, and even \"disaffected Democrats.\"\n\n\"Who is ready to save this country? This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,\" Lake said.\n\nArizona has become a key swing state in the presidential contest, meaning even primary races have attracted high-profile endorsements and attention. The state helped President Biden clinch his win in 2020, and Democrats swept key statewide races, including the U.S. Senate seat that Masters lost, in 2022.\n\nBut Republicans now hold nearly a 260,000-person advantage among registered voters, and hope to use that to reclaim the state for Trump.\n\nLoading...\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Arizona Child Welfare Director Dismissed Amid GOP Attacks Speaks Out\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nArizona's newly elected Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, has given up on another of her Cabinet nominees in the face of misleading attacks from Republicans in the state Legislature. Matthew Stewart was forced out last Wednesday after serving just a month and a half as Hobbs' director of the Department of Child Safety , the state child protective services agency.\n\nWhen Hobbs selected Stewart in December, she called him one of \"the best minds Arizona has to offer\" and a leader on racial justice issues who would \"transform\" a child welfare system that ProPublica and NBC News had found investigated the families of 1 in 3 Black children in metro Phoenix during a recent five-year period.\n\nNow, Hobbs has forced Stewart to leave his post before he could defend his record in a public hearing.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, the first since his ouster, Stewart said the Republicans' attacks on him are inaccurate and reputation-damaging. More than a dozen current and former DCS employees, all of whom were contacted independently by the news organization and not at Stewart's recommendation, confirmed that the allegations about him that have since been circulating in the news media are unfounded.\n\n\"If you believe change is needed, and you make a decision to bring in a person who will create change, then you stand behind that person,\" Stewart said of the governor abandoning him. \"I'm an example of someone willing to take a risk going into a bureaucratic, deeply ingrained system trying to bring new thinking, new energy.\"\n\n\"I wanted to have the opportunity to go through [the confirmation process] and defend myself,\" Stewart said, adding that dismissing him was a \"way for the governor to stay safe.\"\n\nIt all started with a vaguely worded news release issued Wednesday by state Sen. Jake Hoffman, a Republican who has been banned from social media platforms for spreading misinformation and running an online troll farm . He has also denied Hobbs' legitimacy as governor.\n\nHoffman chairs the Arizona Senate Committee on Director Nominations, a panel for vetting Cabinet appointments that was formed after Hobbs' November victory over Republican Kari Lake and that never existed before 2023.\n\nIn his statement, Hoffman said that \"Katie Hobbs openly touted skin color as her seemingly only priority in the search for the next potential DCS director.\"\n\nStewart is Black and the son of the longtime senior pastor of Phoenix's most prominent Black church. He previously worked at DCS for over a decade as a case manager and training supervisor before quitting over the racial disproportionality he saw in the agency's enforcement.\n\nHoffman also said, without providing supporting detail, that Stewart had committed insubordination and taken an unauthorized absence during his prior stint working at the agency.\n\nDCS disciplinary records, obtained by ProPublica from the department, show Stewart received this reprimand (his only complaint during his more than a decade on the job) because he asked to work from home in the spring of 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. His daughter is severely asthmatic, and a doctor had warned him against going in to the office.\n\nStewart said he informed Hobbs about this when he interviewed with her team, and they said it wasn't a problem.\n\nHoffman, the Republican lawmaker, also cast aspersions on Stewart's recent decisions to dismiss four top DCS officials - adding that some of those who'd been let go are \"openly gay.\"\n\nAccording to an internal email obtained by ProPublica from DCS employees independent of Stewart, he did inform the staff on Jan. 20 that he was dismissing the department's deputy director of field operations, its chief of the office of child welfare investigations and two top program administrators in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.\n\nBut Stewart had already told ProPublica in multiple interviews over the last year that those individuals were part of an institutional culture that had led to the agency's high rate of investigations and separations of low-income families as well as its problem with turnover among overworked caseworkers - and that for DCS to change direction, they would have to go.\n\nTrying to reform any agency, he has consistently said, requires replacing people in leadership positions.\n\nStewart said in an interview Sunday that his decisions to part ways with the four officials were run by the governor's office and went through normal HR channels at the Arizona Department of Administration, and that he didn't know each of the individuals' sexual orientation.\n\nFive current and former DCS employees who identify as LGBTQ also said in interviews or emails with ProPublica that Stewart has consistently supported them and worked closely with them, and that the implication of any discrimination by him is, in their view, without merit.\n\nThe governor's office agrees that none of the issues brought up by the Republican committee had anything to do with Hobbs dismissing Stewart.\n\n\"Completely baseless,\" said Ben Henderson, the governor's director of operations, of the implication that there was anti-LGBTQ bias in Stewart's personnel decisions.\n\nHenderson told ProPublica that the real reason for forcing Stewart out was that while he had the \"vision\" to change the direction of DCS, he didn't have the day-to-day administrative acumen to run an agency with a billion-dollar budget and thousands of employees.\n\nThe governor's team declined to specify what exactly Stewart wasn't capable of as an administrator or how a month and a half was enough time to know that he wasn't up to the task.\n\nStewart said it is \"news to me\" that there was any issue with his performance, and that the governor's office had never contacted him about this. He said that on Wednesday morning, they scheduled a meeting and told him it was clear to them that his confirmation wouldn't make it past Republican opposition, and that they would therefore be withdrawing his nomination.\n\nNothing substantive about his record or managerial abilities was mentioned then or at any point in the past month and a half, Stewart reiterated, saying that he'd only received positive if sparse feedback from Hobbs' office on his hiring and other executive decisions.\n\nThe version of events from the governor's office \"sounds like controlling the narrative,\" Stewart said.\n\nIn an email Tuesday, C. Murphy Hebert, the governor's spokesperson, said that Hobbs has \"so much respect for Mr. Stewart\" that she doesn't want to challenge his experience of what happened last week. And the issue of his likely not getting through the committee process \"was definitely part of the larger conversation.\"\n\n\"The bottom line, Cabinet members serve at the pleasure of the Governor, and this is a decision that was made in everyone's best interest,\" Hebert said.\n\nThe governor's staff said they're having internal conversations about repairing the reputations of both Stewart and Dr. Theresa Cullen, who too was recently pulled from consideration as head of the state's health department after similar attacks from Hoffman and his committee.\n\nIn Cullen's case, several supporters of Stewart pointed out, the governor did at least issue a statement defending her .\n\nAfter Stewart's dismissal Wednesday, he was sent back to the DCS office to pack up his belongings and go home. Later that day, Hoffman, the Republican legislator, released his statement taking credit for the governor's decision to remove Stewart and citing it as evidence of the need for his new Cabinet nominee vetting committee.\n\nClaire Louge, executive director of the child maltreatment prevention organization Prevent Child Abuse Arizona, said she met with Stewart the morning before he was forced to leave. She said she asked him what he was looking for in the high-level positions he had dismissed people from.\n\nPart of his answer was that he really wanted DCS leadership to have optimism and \"show up differently\" in the lives of struggling families, Louge said.\n\n\"What did they expect?\" she said of the governor's office. \"Matthew Stewart is a known visionary, a known advocate, who did not have extensive administrative experience. They knew that.\"\n\nDCS staffers - some of whom took jobs at the agency since Stewart was hired because they wanted to work with him - say they are upset by the way he was treated, as are many people in Arizona's Black community.\n\nDustin Sallaz, a case manager and later supervisor at DCS from 2017 to 2022 who is openly gay and has worked extensively with Stewart, said Stewart was always an \"amazing\" and \"communicative\" DCS colleague who took time to get to know the families he worked with - and that he was right to fire the people he fired.\n\nSamantha Aiello was a case manager and program specialist at DCS from 2016 to 2022, when she left the department to work with Stewart's nonprofit organization, Our Sister Our Brother, which advocates for vulnerable families caught up in the child welfare system. She also identifies as LGBTQ, noting that Stewart knew this and sent her an Edible Arrangement for her wedding.\n\n\"Matt is the most compassionate person I've ever had the chance to work for,\" she said.\n\nThe current and former DCS employees interviewed by ProPublica agreed that the officials whom Stewart fired, all key figures in charge of the department's day-to-day operations, were widely known for contributing to long-standing problems at the agency, including staff retention.\n\nProPublica has requested that DCS provide documentation of the officials' complaints about Stewart but has not received the records.\n\nThe four officials could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn an interview, Kim Quintero, director of communications for the Arizona Senate Republicans, said the allegations about Stewart came from a whistleblower whose identity Hoffman and his team are protecting. \"We have attorneys that review these things before they even go out, so we did everything legally accurate,\" she said, referring to documentation she said the committee reviewed.\n\nRegarding the allegation that discrimination had something to do with Stewart's decisions about which DCS officials to dismiss, Quintero said that \"obviously, an investigation hasn't been done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hoffman, the committee chair, is leading a group of conservatives who plan to sue Hobbs for issuing an executive order guaranteeing equal employment opportunities for LGBTQ people working at state agencies. He also wrote a bill that would have banned books from schools that depict \"acts\" of \"homosexuality.\"\n\nRead More\n\nStewart said that many of the changes he made in the short time he was director \"were ones that needed to happen for years, maybe decades,\" adding that his goal was to reshape \"what the community experiences when DCS knocks on their door.\"\n\nHe also said that during his initial interviews with Hobbs' team, he was asked what it would mean to the public if he were picked as DCS director. \"I said it would mean she wants change,\" Stewart said of the governor.\n\n\"That was my charge,\" he said. \"I believe that is why I was hired.\"\n\nLynn Dombek contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter who writes about issues affecting poor and working-class people across the country.\n\nI'm interested in hearing from current and former insiders at federal agencies that administer anti-poverty programs, as well as working-class people of all stripes about how their lives are changing.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nArizona Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs is taking the state's child protective services agency in a radically different direction in the wake of a ProPublica-NBC News investigation into the racial disparities that have plagued the child welfare system here.\n\nThis week, Hobbs, a Democrat, announced that she has selected Matthew Stewart, a Black community advocate, as the new head of Arizona's Department of Child Safety. Stewart previously worked at DCS as a case manager and training supervisor for a decade before quitting in 2020, later saying he was ashamed by the racial disproportionality he was seeing in his work.\n\nStewart, who is the son of the longtime senior pastor of Phoenix's most prominent Black church, will be the first Black leader of the department, replacing its current director, Mike Faust. Faust had been appointed by outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican.\n\nArizona's child welfare system has long disproportionately investigated Black families. According to the ProPublica-NBC News investigation, which highlighted Stewart's role, 1 in 3 Black children in metro Phoenix faced a DCS investigation in just a recent five-year period. Faust said the department had made progress over that time, but the news organizations found that while the overall number of investigations has gone down, the racial disparity between white and Black families has only increased.\n\nAfter leaving DCS, Stewart formed the community organization Our Sister Our Brother, which has fought the department for more equitable treatment of Black and also low-income parents.\n\nThis fall, he told ProPublica and NBC News that generational poverty and the resulting trauma within families, which in some cases can lead to parenting problems and in turn DCS investigations, have been \"centuries in the making.\" Are parents supposed to believe, he asked, that after the department takes custody of their children, \"these things will be solved?\"\n\n\"I simply don't think DCS is the agency to do this,\" he said.\n\nStewart will now run that very agency.\n\nStewart was not immediately available for an interview. But he said in a statement that he will strengthen the state's partnerships with community organizations and hopes that under his team's leadership, the department will \"become a place for encouraging and facilitating community healing\" in part by providing more resources to families in need.\n\nIn a separate statement, the governor-elect said that Stewart knows how to keep children safe based on his experience working at DCS, but also how to get families help and keep them united. \"He is a leader who will ensure that we can continue to transform our public systems so they are responsive to the communities that we serve,\" Hobbs said.\n\nChild welfare experts in the state and families affected by the system praised Stewart's selection, though some wondered how much change he could bring about even in DCS' top position.\n\n\"Matthew Stewart has been singularly focused on keeping families safely together,\" said Claire Louge, executive director of Prevent Child Abuse Arizona, an organization that provides services and training to prevent child maltreatment. But, she pointed out, like all DCS directors he \"will face the challenge of leading an agency that is perpetually criticized - either for removing children from their families too much or too little.\"\n\nRichard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, an advocacy group, noted that \"Arizona's incredibly tough to fix.\" He pointed to a previous Democratic governor of the state, Janet Napolitano, whose reform-minded pick to lead DCS' forerunner agency couldn't fix the system's racial disproportionality two decades ago. \"We'll see how much times have changed,\" Wexler said.\n\nTyra Smith, a Phoenix-area parent who has personal experience with the child welfare system and has worked directly with Stewart as a parent advocate, said she is hopeful about Stewart's leadership but worries that when given a new role, people can change.\n\n\"I just don't want to be forgotten about,\" she said.\n\nStewart's first order of business likely will be selecting new senior staff; he has been critical of several of DCS' current top officials.\n\nHe also has expressed excitement about installing a new Cultural Brokers program that will ensure that a trusted community member of the same race is present when DCS caseworkers show up at a family's door.\n\nBut Stewart will be partially hamstrung by the fact that the Legislature, still in Republican hands, is unlikely to adjust its anti-poverty agenda to get more economic assistance and support services to struggling families in order to prevent child maltreatment cases before they happen. Currently, Arizona spends a majority of its welfare budget not on direct assistance to low-income parents but on DCS investigations of them, as ProPublica reported in 2021 .\n\nStewart also will have to focus on more than the racial disparity issue: DCS has been plagued by other scandals in recent years, as well as child fatalities. In one example, the outgoing director, Faust, was grilled by legislators about reports of violence and drug use in the state's foster system, leading to one teenager at a group home being shot and killed.\n\nRead More\n\nBut for the dozens of Black families across metro Phoenix who spoke with ProPublica and NBC News this year, there is finally a sense that someone who looks like them, who has actually interacted with them and who will listen to them is now in a position of power in a state where only two of 90 state legislators are Black. Many said in interviews that they know Stewart understands the constant, communitywide dread they feel, given that in Maricopa County, 63% of Black children will go through a DCS investigation by the time they turn 18.\n\nAfter Hobbs defeated Kari Lake in the governor's race, Stewart told ProPublica and NBC News that \"I believe this will work to our benefit.\" He noted that Hobbs' background as a social worker might provide her with \"a values frame and openness to change that will help guide her administration and choice of advisers.\"\n\nStewart said he \"can't predict the future,\" but \"I am optimistic, and I believe it is never too soon for hope.\"\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter who writes about issues affecting poor and working-class people across the country.\n\nI'm interested in hearing from current and former insiders at federal agencies that administer anti-poverty programs, as well as working-class people of all stripes about how their lives are changing.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "How Kari Lake Went From Local Anchor to New Face of the MAGA Right\n\nDonald Trump read the names off a teleprompter. It was July 2021, and the former President was speaking at the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action's confab in Phoenix, where candidates vying for the GOP nomination for Arizona governor hoped to grab his attention. Insiders expected Trump to endorse Matt Salmon, a former congressman with whom he was known to golf.\n\nTrump took a moment to recognize the candidates who had shown up. First was Salmon, who drew tepid applause. Then he mentioned Kari Lake. Thousands of fans rose to their feet and began chanting her name. Trump was visibly shocked. \"Whoa!\" he said, searching for Lake in the audience. \"This could be a big night for you.\"\n\nAfter Trump finished his speech, he approached one of his confidants backstage with a question: Who is Kari Lake?\n\nAn anchor for Fox 10 Phoenix until last year, Lake has been a fixture in Arizona homes for more than a quarter of a century. Since then, she's parlayed what may matter most in today's Republican Party-the ability to captivate an audience-into a startling political ascent. Polls show her locked in a dead heat with Democrat Katie Hobbs in the race to lead a key battleground state. The prospect of a Lake victory electrifies the right and terrifies the left.\n\nIf elected, Lake, 53, would oversee Arizona's next election-a source of profound anxiety for Democrats and some Republicans, who worry that Lake would subvert the will of the voters in 2024. Lake has said Joe Biden \"lost the election and shouldn't be in the White House,\" and claimed that she wouldn't have certified Biden's Arizona victory in 2020. Liz Cheney , the Republican vice chair of the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, is among those who have cast Lake as a threat to American democracy.\n\n\"That's total bull-t,\" Lake told me when I raised these concerns with her. \"I will certify the 2024 election. You know why? Because we're going to have election integrity bills that are passed that shore up our election laws, that remove loopholes from cheating. By the 2024 election, we're going to have honest elections in Arizona, full stop.\"\n\nSuch a declaration is unlikely to appease her detractors, who fear that her definition of \"honest elections\" will only be ones that Republicans win.\n\nLake's mark on the state as governor wouldn't stop there. She would have a major say over the future of abortion access in Arizona. She has vowed to root out \"woke teaching\" from schools and block vaccine mandates of any kind, measures that Arizona political analysts suspect would be supported in the state legislature. And she's planning to engage the Biden administration in a series of legal fights-on everything from education to the border-with the goal of engineering favorable rulings from a conservative Supreme Court.\n\nYet even if Lake suffers a narrow loss, her growing profile and connection with crowds suggests she'll remain a force within the GOP. Pundits are already speculating that Trump could tap her as a running mate in 2024. In other words, she could be the future of the Republican Party.\n\nIt's easy to see why when Lake takes the stage at a chic Scottsdale sports bar in mid-October. Although she regularly draws huge crowds, Lake still acts surprised over how many people show up to see her. \"Are they offering two-for-one drinks, or what?\" she says to the hundreds packed shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nIt never takes long for Lake to take aim at her favorite target. \"Raise your hand if you're with the fake news,\" she says, to big belly laughs. \"They don't want to ask about inflation. They don't want to ask about security at the border. They don't want to ask about crime. They don't want to ask about the struggles families are facing.\"\n\nFor the next 55 minutes, Lake-garbed in a shiny pink blouse, her hair styled in a perfect pixie cut, a gold cross hanging below her neck-dazzles the crowd with personal asides, punchlines, and provocations. She whips them up by deriding schools for incorporating trans issues into the curriculum. And she paints her entry into politics as part of a last stand to save America from irreversible decline. \"I walked away from my paycheck, which was beautiful and large, because I realized what good is a paycheck, what good is all of that, if you don't have a country to enjoy it in? If our children, if our babies, aren't free?\"\n\nIt was a vivid exhibition of Lake's knack for retail politics and the credibility she has with the GOP base that comes from rebelling against the \"fake news\" from within.\n\nPaul and Jenna Wyer, a couple in their 40s from Scottsdale, hung on to Lake's every word. They disagree with her on perhaps the most divisive social issue-they support abortion rights, she does not-but they don't see that as a dealbreaker. \"We watched her on TV,\" Jenna tells me. \"A lot of her values are at the core of our own values as a family.\"\n\nRepublican Steve May, a former member of the Arizona House, has a piercing memory of Lake. In 1999, May defied the military's \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy. When he sat down with Lake for an interview, she asked how he was handling the attention. He said he found it unsettling that \"people would come up to me at the grocery store, the airport, and just start a conversation as if they knew me and we had a prior relationship.\"\n\n\"Steve, they do have a relationship with you,\" Lake told him, according to May. \"You have been in their living room. You just don't have a relationship with them.\"\n\nIt's a moment that May believes provides insight into Lake's campaign. \"That's the belief and experience that she hopes will elect her governor: familiarity,\" he says. \"She knows this is her superpower.\"\n\nLake was born in Rock Island, Illinois in 1969, but grew up in eastern Iowa. She was the youngest of nine children, with eight sisters and one brother. When she was seven years old, her parents divorced and had a custody battle. Her father won, which Lake attributes to the fact that he had a more stable job situation.\n\nLarry Lake was a high school teacher and football coach. He often brought his young daughter with him to practices. Because they lived in a rural school district, Lake went to the same school where her father taught, North Scott Senior High in Eldridge, Iowa. She ended up taking one of his social studies classes. She got a B.\n\nHer mother, Sheila Lake, was a nurse. While Lake describes her as an \"amazing human,\" she says she's glad her father raised her. \"Obviously, a mother's really important in those first few years of a child's life, in that nurturing phase, and then after that, I believe fathers are actually almost more important.\" She describes women who grew up without fathers as often \"searching for somebody to define them,\" but that \"when you have a strong father in your life as a girl, you don't need somebody else to define you. Your father helped define you.\"\n\nAt 16, Lake graduated from high school early after amassing enough credits, and enrolled at the University of Iowa. During her first two years, she thought she would become an elementary school teacher, but she had no major, and worked various part-time jobs to pay her tuition, including at a pizza joint and a computer store. She was also, at one point, a janitor at a drug treatment center. After her sophomore year, she took two years off of school, working at first as a radio sales agent, and later as a receptionist, while she lived with an older sister and her sister's husband in Minneapolis.\n\nHer brother-in-law watched the local news every night, something Lake had never done much of before. She was transfixed. \"I started watching it, and I'm like, this looks like a great job,\" she says. \"You're in the middle of everything.\"\n\nShe returned to Iowa City a year later and became a communications major, with the goal of getting into broadcasting. \"When I went back, I was on a mission, and I had a passion, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do,\" she says.\n\nAfter graduating in 1992, she worked as a production assistant at KWQC, in Davenport, Iowa, before joining another station in Rock Island for two years. After that, NBC's Channel 12 in Phoenix hired her as a weekend weather anchor.\n\nLake worked at NBC for four years, until she left for a one-year stint in Albany, New York. In 1999, she returned to Phoenix as Fox 10's evening anchor, taking the lead role at 5 and 9 p.m. Lake and her co-host John Hook soon became one of the the most watched local news programs in Arizona's largest market, working side by side for 22 years.\n\nFor most of Lake's time in the newsroom, she wasn't known to be outspoken about politics, which made her decision to run for office all the more surprising to her former colleagues. \"It was such a shock to me,\" says Diana Pike, Lake's HR manager for nearly two decades.\n\nLake says she registered as a Republican the day she turned 18 but kept her views out of her work. \"If you're a good journalist,\" she says, \"you don't push your opinion.\"\n\nShe says she grew embittered with her party during the George W. Bush Administration, and donated to John Kerry's campaign in 2004 and Barack Obama's in 2008, both in protest of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and registered as a Democrat for a four-year-stretch. \"I was thinking which of these candidates is going to end the war,\" she explains. \"I'd covered John McCain for 20 years, and I didn't think it was going to be him. So I took a shot on our first Black president.\"\n\nAccording to Lake, Trump's message first resonated with her when he delivered his campaign launch speech in June of 2015. \"The media went crazy,\" Lake says. \"I went, wait a minute, why are they going crazy? He's actually speaking the language of a lot of American people.\"\n\nThere were few outward signs at the time of Lake's conversion to MAGA faithful. In 2016, she floated what she called a \"humane and fair\" proposal on social media that would give amnesty to millions of immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. (Her campaign says she was only asking her followers their thoughts on the idea, not endorsing it.)\n\nBut Lake's social media posts would start to demonstrate a right-ward shift in the years ahead. In April 2018, she faced a backlash for tweeting that the pro-public education movement \"Red for Ed\" was conspiring to legalize marijuana. Lake later apologized on air.\n\nSeveral of Lake's Fox colleagues say they first noticed a change in her thinking after she returned from a June 2019 trip to Washington to interview Stephanie Grisham, an Arizona native who was serving as Melania Trump's communications director. While there, she also scored an interview with the President.\n\n\"She was more pro-Trump when she came back from that assignment,\" says a former colleague, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Lake with reporters.\n\nFrom then on, Lake's former colleagues say, she began challenging the producers over their political coverage, pressing them over what she argued was their covering one side of the story, or ignoring Trump's side. \"Oftentimes, those things would be some ridiculous conspiracy theories and things like that,\" one of them adds.\n\nIn July 2019, she faced scrutiny for joining Parler, a social media platform known for its right-wing audience. \"Sounds like this is the only social media site that is actually putting the First Amendment first,\" she wrote on her first post. \"Bravo!\" Later that month, she was caught on a hot mic dismissing the controversy and the potential for blowback from a local weekly newspaper, the Phoenix New Times. \"F-k them,\" she said. \"That's a rag for selling marijuana.\"\n\nBut Lake's disillusionment with journalism peaked during the pandemic. She was isolated at home with her family. Fox 10 was limiting the number of people allowed into the office. Her husband, Jeff Halperin, a videographer who used to work at NBC's Phoenix affiliate, set up a studio in their house, with a sophisticated lighting display and a state-of-the-art camera. Lake's co-anchor, Hook, worked from the newsroom.\n\nEven though more than 1 million Americans have died from the virus, Lake believes the wall-to-wall Covid coverage early in the pandemic was tantamount to fear mongering. \"I don't know how anybody is still a journalist after coming through Covid, to be honest,\" she says. \"You couldn't question anything about Covid. That's where I had a problem. I just felt like, wow, this has ceased being journalism. It is pure propaganda.\"\n\nIn one instance, Lake wanted to do a segment on a patient who recovered from Covid after taking ivermectin, a drug mostly used to treat animals that Trump and other right-wing media figures had promoted as a possible treatment but whose efficacy had not been established. The station killed the story, according to both her best friend Lisa Dale and her sister Jill Stringham. (Fox 10 Phoenix declined to comment for this report.)\n\nStringham recalls Lake saying, \"I can't do this anymore. It's killing me inside. It's eating away my soul.\"\n\nLake had been raised Catholic. She and Jeff-whose mother was Colombian and father was Jewish-raised their kids in the faith, but were put off by the Church's child abuse scandals. \"So we just kind of raised them Christian and believed in God and Jesus and all that, but we weren't overly active in the church,\" Lake says.\n\nThat changed during the pandemic when Dale introduced her to a nearby Evangelical church. \"Our Catholic Church was closed,\" Lake says with frustration evident in her voice. \"It was by appointment only. And we really felt that we needed to be in church. We were struggling as a people.\" Lake recalls stepping through the doors of Scottsdale Bible Church for the first time and feeling a jolt to her system. \"It was like an epiphany for me that I had never experienced before in my faith journey.\"\n\nBy December of 2020, Lake had reached a breaking point. She told Dale she was planning to leave Fox 10.\n\n\"You can't quit,\" Dale told her, ticking off all the objections: \"How much time do you have left on your contract? How much money have you saved? Are you going to have to live in my house?\" According to Dale, Lake said, \"I can't look at myself in the mirror while I'm putting on my makeup and feel proud about what I do anymore.\"\n\nThe next day, Dale and Lake went to church, and the pastor delivered a sermon that might as well have been speaking directly to Lake.\n\n\"What you do for work is important,\" he told his flock, per Dale's recollection, \"but it shouldn't control or change who you are. God doesn't want his children to be miserable in a dead-end job that doesn't make them happy.\"\n\nWhen they got in the car afterwards, Dale turned to Lake. \"Kari, you need to quit.\" Lake's eyes pierced hers. \"I know,\" she said.\n\nIn March of 2021, Lake resigned by posting on social media a two-and-a-half minute video that her husband filmed of her, shot in soft focus and with a gauzy tone. \"In the last few years, I haven't felt proud to be a member of the media,\" Lake says in the clip. By the next morning, it went viral, and calls for her to run for office soon followed, from users on social media, people on the street, and GOP operatives.\n\nLake had already begun to weigh jobs in the private sector, including as a media consultant or as a virtual reality specialist. She also had offers to join conservative media outlets, she says. But now she began to consider politics. So she contacted some Arizona politicos for their advice, such as Sal Diccicio, a Phoenix city council member, and Kelli Ward, the chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party. \"What's the first step?\" Lake recalls asking them.\n\nMeanwhile, she began to surround herself with other political vets, like Tom Van Flein, a former chief of staff for Rep. Paul Gosar who was part of Sarah Palin's inner circle when she was running for vice president, and Sam Stone, who was Diccicio's chief of staff.\n\n\"I was kind of contemplating running for the U.S. Senate or running for governor,\" she says, but she chose the latter because she didn't want to leave Arizona. She also had little interest in being one vote in a larger body. She wanted executive authority.\n\n\"I realized during Covid-I think the whole country realized-just how powerful our governors are,\" she says. \"They had the power to do right, or they could really mess our lives up. Unfortunately, too many of them messed our lives up and shut our schools down, masked our children, closed our businesses, shut our churches down, quarantined healthy people. It was coming from governors.\"\n\nIn May of 2021, Lake drove two hours north to Pine, Arizona, to celebrate Stringham's birthday. Midway through dinner, Lake told her sister that she figured out what she was going to do next-run for office. Stringham recalls asking her which office, assuming she would say either state senator or representative.\n\n\"She goes 'Governor,'\" Stringham recalls. \"I think I might have dropped my fork.\"\n\nWhen the Lake campaign launched in June of 2021, local pundits brushed her off. She may have been well known throughout the state-\"I probably had $10 million in name ID or more,\" Lake says-but she had nowhere near the war chest of her opponents. And she was a first-time candidate.\n\nHer bid for the GOP nomination shifted from longshot to frontrunner status on July 24, 2021, when Turning Point Action held its Phoenix summit with Trump. Once the former president stepped off the stage, he asked Charlie Kirk, Turning Point's founder, about the woman who had roused the crowd. \"I want to meet with her,\" he said, according to Kirk. \"What is her story?\"\n\nIt was exactly the kind of reception that Trump looks for in a candidate. \"When President Trump saw how popular she was with the grassroots here in Arizona, arguably one of the most important target states, it was like, how do you deny that?\" says Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point Action's chief operating officer, who helped plan the rally.\n\nRead more : Why Donald Trump Is Making Extremely Local Endorsements\n\nTrump invited Lake and her husband to Trump Tower the next month. At the outset of the conversation, Trump brought up the reaction to her in Phoenix. \"That's not a poll that you hire some pollster to do,\" Trump told her, according to Lake. \"That's a real poll. That's the people telling you who they like.\"\n\nThe meeting was supposed to last only 20 minutes. It went on for over an hour. By the end, Trump told Lake he was going to support her. It happened to be Lake's birthday.\n\nTrump blasted out his seal of approval in a statement a month later, far earlier than he had gotten involved in other races in the midterm election cycle. \"Few can take on the Fake News Media like Kari,\" Trump said. \"She has my Complete and Total endorsement.\"\n\nEverywhere Lake goes , she has a lavalier mic attached to her. It's for her husband, who films practically her every move, to capture each conversation she has with journalists. They say it's a form of self-protection. If Lake thinks a reporter has misrepresented her words, or ambushed her with a loaded question, her team will post the tete-a-tete online. The strategy has helped establish her as one of the MAGA right's rising stars.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of the media because I've worked in the media,\" she tells me. \"I don't understand why people are afraid of the media. Half of these people-they're not very smart. I hate to say it. I mean, there are smart people in the media, but the majority of them aren't very smart. So it's not hard to outsmart them. I think people running for office should just remember that.\"\n\nLake has shown herself adept at manufacturing feisty clashes with reporters.\n\nA few weeks before the primary, her husband filmed a CNN reporter approaching Lake outside an event, asking if she had a moment to chat. \"I'll do an interview,\" Lake says, \"but only if you agree to air it on CNN+,\" referring to the recently defunct steaming service. \"Does that still exist? I didn't think so, because the people don't like what you guys are peddling, which is propaganda.\"\n\nLake's team posted the clip on social media and, within hours, it caught on like wildfire, eventually capturing the attention of Tucker Carlson, who lionized the exchange as offering a blueprint for how Republican politicians should deal with the mainstream press.\n\nIn August, Lake won her primary by five percentage points, carrying every single county in the state. That set up a clash with Hobbs, who, in the face of pressure from Trump and his allies, helped to certify Biden's narrow 2020 win as Arizona's secretary of state, with Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and a GOP-controlled legislature.\n\nDemocrats fear that Hobbs has run a lackluster campaign, marked by her refusal to debate Lake, her absence on the trail, and a past employee suing her over discrimination. News of a registration error in her office this month that could affect up to 6,000 voters added to a perception of a flailing bid.\n\nA stronger candidate could counter Lake more effectively, argue Democratic operatives, who say their focus groups show Lake's message shouldn't be resonating with Arizona's middle-of-the-road voters. \"The more people learn about Kari Lake, the more hesitant they are,\" says Eric Hyers, a Democratic strategist who has managed multiple gubernatorial campaigns. \"You have bomb throwers like Kari Lake win congressional offices all the time, but it's much tougher for someone who thrives on chaos and who thrives on controversy to get elected governor.\"\n\nHobbs declined multiple requests for an interview, and would only agree to respond to written questions. \"Kari Lake is only interested in creating a spectacle,\" she wrote to TIME, adding, \"Our race for governor isn't about Democrats vs. Republicans. It's about sanity vs. chaos.\"\n\nThe issues that divide them are stark. Since the Supreme Court ended federal abortion rights in June, Arizona has been mired in a legal battle over which state law is now in effect: a total ban on the procedure from 1864, or a 15-week ban that Gov. Ducey signed this year. For now, the latter is being enforced. Hobbs has called for restoring Roe v. Wade . She also wants to allow abortions during the third trimester under extraordinary circumstances. Lake, in contrast, has called abortion \"the ultimate sin\" and, in recent weeks, has been noncommittal on whether she would back a total ban or a 15-week ban when in office. \"I'm going to be governor, not emperor,\" she says. \"I will execute the laws on the books.\"\n\nHobbs has also insisted that Lake would refuse to certify the presidential election in two years if a Democrat won Arizona. \"As Donald Trump's most loyal foot soldier in denying the results of the 2020 election, Kari Lake cannot be in a position of power to certify the 2024 election,\" Hobbs says.\n\nIt's a concern shared also among some Arizona Republicans, including Rusty Bowers, the state's longtime GOP Speaker of the House who stood up against Trump and Rudy Giuliani's push to have him hold a special session to decertify Biden's win there. Since then, Bowers has lost a campaign for the state senate.\n\nBowers says it would be hard for a governor to decertify an election result on their own without both a like-minded secretary of state and an acquiescent legislature. Mark Finchem , the GOP nominee for secretary of state, has also denied that Biden won the election and is currently polling ahead of Democrat Adrian Fontes. Such a trifecta, Bowers posits, could be \"a perfect storm depending on who gets the speakership.\"\n\nRead more : Conspiracy Theorists Want to Run America's Elections. These Are the Candidates Standing in Their Way\n\nLake insists such fears are unfounded, and yet she hasn't said explicitly that she would certify the election no matter who wins. She says she will work with the legislature to pass an election integrity bill that improves the state's elections system to the point that she would have no reason not to certify the results in 2024. Arizona was ground zero for 2020 election disputes, and despite a litany of allegations, no evidence of substantial fraud has come to light. A comprehensive investigation by Arizona's Maricopa County found \"100 potentially questionable ballots cast out of 2.1 million.\"\n\nLake and her top aides say they want to harden the state's voter ID requirements and transition fully to paper ballots. To avoid the possibility of hacking, they say they want to use electronic machines that don't rely on software to tabulate the votes. And lastly, they want to mandate an annual audit of all elections.\n\nOf course, the devil is always in the details-and those haven't been fleshed out yet, Lake admits. \"I don't know exactly what it's going to look like,\" she tells me, referring to the elections overhaul she envisions. \"But I will guarantee you this: We will have honest elections. That is a top priority.\"\n\nOther top priorities include issuing a \"Declaration of Invasion\" at the southern border, which Lake and her team say would pave the way for Arizona to complete Trump's border wall in the state, and station Arizona's national guard troops along the border. Both of those efforts would likely set up legal fights with the federal government and outside groups, which Lake's team predicts would eventually make it to the Supreme Court. \"I hope it does,\" Lake says.\n\nThe calculated attempt to bring about court battles with the Biden administration may sound like a platform for rabble rousing. It is that, but it's not only that. Lake's team is betting that an emboldened six-vote conservative Supreme Court majority will welcome the opportunity to rewrite constitutional law in order to bless aggressive, boundary-pushing conservative policymaking.\n\nA Lake victory would be a jarring setback for Democrats in a state that was one of their biggest triumphs two years ago. Arizona is a battleground for the soul of America. It's poised on a knife's edge: an increasingly diverse electorate that just barely went blue in 2020 but that is now fielding hardcore conservatives who stand a good chance of winning.\n\nBut even before the votes have been cast, Lake has established herself as a MAGA elite. GOP hopefuls are expected to start seeking her endorsement almost as aggressively as Trump's, according to Republican insiders.\n\nIt's not the only way that expectations are high. Toward the end of the event in Scottsdale, the moderator gets to a question surely on everyone's minds: \"Are you going to run for President?\"\n\nLake's answer is at once conventional and unorthodox. She says she's focused on her current race. But she conveys the message in what has become her trademark manner-by bashing her former colleagues in the press.\n\n\"It's so funny that this question is even being asked,\" she says, \"because the fake news, when I first got into this, they were calling me incompetent and 'She doesn't know what she's doing.' Now they're like, 'Are you going to run for VP? Are you going to be President?' It's like, okay, slow down, everybody.\"\n\nThe audience is eating it all up. But then, Lake's tone and body language harden. She points toward the back of the room, her finger aimed at the cameras and the reporters jotting down her every word. \"I want to let the fake news know: No, I am not. I'm going to be the governor,\" she says. \"I'm going to be your worst nightmare for eight years.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "In Arizona's Senate Race, Everyone Is Waiting on Kari Lake\n\nA few months ago, Kari Lake met with a trusted confidante. After refusing to concede her narrow loss for Arizona governor, the former news anchor's legal effort to reverse Democrat Katie Hobbs' victory was nearing its end, and she was thinking ahead to what would come next. She wanted to discuss her plans to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"You really can't afford one more loss,\" warned the source close to Lake, who requested anonymity to speak freely, emphasizing the level of resistance she would face vying for a Senate seat in a swing state that could determine the balance of power in Washington. \"The Democrats might drop $50 million on you. They don't want a conservative firebrand, a female Ted Cruz, a female Mike Lee, who is telegenic and really well-spoken. They would probably spend a lot of money to destroy you.\"\n\nLake threw her arms in the air and chuckled. \"They're going to come after me anyways no matter what I do,\" the source recalls Lake saying. \"She didn't really give a sh-t.\"\n\nIt was a sign that Lake, 53, was near certain of her next steps, even as she was waiting for her legal fight to conclude before making it official. In the intervening weeks, as primaries have started to take shape around the country, the situation in Arizona is unusual, in part because Lake is still not finished with her litigation. A Maricopa County judge rejected her case for a second time last week, but Lake has already filed an appeal . She broke that news at a Scottsdale rally she held Thursday night, with hundreds in attendance, as all eyes in Arizona and Washington are on the MAGA darling who boasts a loyal following that sees her as the torchbearer of a populist crusade.\n\nBut a Senate announcement is not imminent, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. While her team once floated the idea of launching her candidacy in June, Lake has pushed a possible Senate campaign start to September or October­. It would come after she goes on a nationwide book tour upon releasing her memoir on June 27.\n\nThe delay is leaving the field of other potential GOP candidates stuck in a state of limbo as they await her decision. Lake remains highly popular among a plurality of Arizona Republicans, positioning her as the immediate frontrunner for her party's nomination. Several prospective Senate hopefuls have been holding back until they know for certain what the right-wing sensation known for her Trump-inspired theatrical fearlessness will do. It's creating an especially difficult dilemma for those with a smaller national profile, who would need more time to get their fundraising and field operation off the ground.\n\n\"She's going to be like the Donald Trump of the GOP primary,\" Mike Noble, chief researcher at the independent Phoenix-based polling group Noble Predictive Insights, tells TIME. \"It's just really hard to get around that 40 or so percent of support. She's still beatable, but it's tough. It's super tough. Hence, why a lot of the field is frozen.\"\n\nRead more : How Kari Lake Went From Local Anchor to New Face of the MAGA Right\n\nLake's deliberations come ahead of one of the most highly anticipated Senate races of next year. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in December to become an independent, will be up for reelection. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is challenging her from the left. Sinema has not yet said she will run again, but she has been laying the groundwork to seek a second term, setting up a likely three-way race in a state that is 34% Republican, 34% Independent, and 30% Democratic, according to state data.\n\nComplicating matters for Arizona Republicans has been Lake's unwillingness to firmly commit to the race, even in private. \"Kari Lake remains laser focused on her court case,\" Caroline Wren, a senior adviser to Lake, tells TIME, noting her latest appeal filed on Thursday. \"You will see more filings in the coming days. Kari Lake is not stopping and she will never back down.\" The seeming ambivalence has led some to suggest that Lake has been dangling the possibility of a Senate candidacy to maintain relevance and media interest.\n\nThat impression has been compounded by her habit of faking out possible launches. On her social media accounts, she recently teased out a \"Big Announcement,\" prompting widespread speculation that she was hopping into the Senate race. Instead, it was to advertise her upcoming book, Unafraid: Just Getting Started . Last week, she held a press conference the day after the judge ruled against her election case, promising another \"Big Announcement.\" This was to unveil a new \"ballot-chasing operation\" intended to boost Republican turnout in Arizona through mail balloting. \"There's a little bit of toying with the media to be had,\" Brady Smith, a staffer on Lake's governor campaign, tells TIME.\n\nSmith insists her flirtation with a Senate bid is not a ploy. \"In all our talks, it's looking extremely, extremely likely,\" he says. \"I wouldn't say 100%. But I really do think 99% is a very fair number.\"\n\nOver the last few months, Lake has been meeting with donors and gauging interest. She's met twice with the National Republican Senate Committee. Sources say the GOP's Senate campaign arm has plainly recognized she would be difficult to beat in a nominating contest. Therefore, it is working to avoid, as best as it can, a repeat of last year's bitter and bloody GOP primary for Arizona governor. Some conservatives suspect the $20 million in attack ads that wealthy businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson launched against Lake in the final weeks of the campaign hurt Lake's standing with moderate Republicans in the general election. Because Arizona's primary comes so late in the cycle-in August-candidates don't have as much wiggle room to recover from internecine infighting as they do in other states. \"Not a lot of time for those wounds from the primary to heal,\" Smith says.\n\nAs of now, there is only one Republican in the race: Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who is well-liked in conservative circles but not considered a formidable challenger to Lake. Robson, who lost to Lake by five points in the 2022 gubernatorial primary, said last week she wouldn't run. (Sources close to her say she's holding off to try again for governor in 2026.) Former Gov. Doug Ducey has shown no interest in a Senate run. Former solar executive Jim Lamon, who ran for Senate last year but lost in the GOP primary, has told associates he would run if no real challenger to Lake emerges. He has the means to self-fund his bid, but it's unclear how much he would be willing to spend on what may well be a futile endeavor.\n\nThe other wildcard is Blake Masters , the young venture capitalist who lost to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly last year. Arizona Republicans have been impressed with Masters' introspection since falling to Kelly by more than 100,000 votes in November. He's made clear to party insiders his desire to seek public office again and has recognized a need to soften his image. Sources familiar with his thinking say he would prefer not to go up against Lake, but he won't wait on her to make his own decision.\n\nAn April poll of registered Republican and undeclared voters conducted by J.L. Partners found Lake leading all potential rivals by double digits. The survey showed Lake with 38% support, compared to 10% for Robson, 8% for Lamb, and 7% for Masters.\n\nWith the clock ticking, some Arizona political veterans are bracing for the possibility that Lake could run without a serious challenger. \"That's a depressing likelihood,\" Steve May, a former member of the Arizona House who has a declared antipathy to Trump-affiliated pols, tells TIME. \"I don't know what polling Lamon and others are seeing. But I don't know what the path is for someone to beat her.\"\n\nIf Lake does face a strong adversary, they are likely to argue that she's not electable in a conservative state that has spurned MAGA candidates in the last three election cycles, says Chuck Coughlin, CEO and founder of the Arizona consultancy HighGround. Her slim loss of 17,000 votes against Hobbs, who was widely viewed as having run a lackluster campaign, is evidence, he argues, that most of the state's voters don't want election-denying America First adherents in office.\n\n\"She could have won if she bought a f-cking ticket to Hawaii and left,\" Coughlin tells TIME. \"Honest to God, if she just shut up, she would have won. There's no doubt in my mind about that. She was consistently hurting herself, as she's consistently continued to do, by limiting her ability to appeal to a broader section of voters.\"\n\nFor her part, Lake has been sending a message that there are some ways she would run her campaign differently. Most notably, she's set up a new ground operation to encourage Republicans to vote by mail, even as she still excoriates the voting method. \"We've gotta stop the machines,\" she told a right-wing media personality Wednesday night. \"We have to stop the mail-in ballots.\"\n\nSince former President Donald Trump castigated mail ballots as rife with fraud, GOP voters have mostly flocked to in-person Election Day voting, a move that influential conservatives have increasingly come to recognize as a strategic blunder, especially after the party's poor national showing in the midterms.\n\nIn Arizona, hundreds of thousands of Arizona Republicans who were sent mail-in ballots never returned them. That wasn't necessarily surprising; the party apparatus was far more invested in mobilizing Election Day turnout. But it marked a stark contrast to Democratic campaigns and activist groups that had operations in place to surgically target their own voters who were automatically sent mail ballots, thereby giving them a competitive advantage in a state where more than 80% of voters cast early ballots. \"I think Republicans now in Arizona have decided if you cannot beat them, you must join them,\" a source close to Lake says. By launching a ballot-chasing operation, Lake can not only raise funds for her nonprofit group and the initiative, her aides say, but convey to fellow Republicans that she's learned some of the lessons of the last election.\n\n\"This hopefully sends a signal to insiders and national committees that we're not going to be bastardizing mail-in ballots. In fact, we're going to be embracing them,\" Smith says. \"This is not a re-litigation of 2022. We're willing to make necessary changes to be victorious.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "In Arizona, Kari Lake Leads United GOP Slate, While Democrats Go It Alone\n\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz.-Call it a tale of two campaign strategies. In the final days and weeks of Arizona's midterm elections, the major Republican and Democratic hopefuls have embarked on strikingly different approaches. Whereas Republicans are running as a unified slate, branding themselves as a single ticket, Democrats are running more of an every-candidate-for-themselves playbook.\n\nThe notably divergent game plans were on full display this weekend. In Scottsdale, north of Phoenix, all of the GOP candidates for statewide office-Kari Lake for governor, Blake Masters for Senate, Abe Hamadeh for attorney general, and Mark Finchem for secretary of state-held a campaign rally together on Saturday, with a massive charter bus that has their faces plastered on its side outside the venue.\n\nA day later, more than 100 miles southeast, both Katie Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state and Democratic nominee for governor, and Sen. Mark Kelly, who's running for reelection, held events at the same time in the same city, but in different locations. Kelly rallied students at the University of Arizona in Tucson, while Hobbs worked to mobilize voters at a nearby senior center, where she warned the audience that her bid against Lake was \"perhaps the most important election for governor in Arizona's history.\"\n\nThe Republican's united front began to coalesce over the summer, after a spate of candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump won their primaries, but really picked up steam in the fall. The four statewide candidates have rallied together virtually every day over the last month. At each stop, their backers write encouraging messages in Sharpie on their \"Arizona First\" get-out-the-vote bus.\n\nAccording to multiple Arizona Republican sources, the candidates are hoping to capitalize on the intense enthusiasm for Lake, the former television journalist who entered politics last year and who has taken Arizona by storm.\n\nLake, who insists that Joe Biden didn't win the 2020 election and has been coy about whether she would accept Tuesday's election results if she loses, has become a MAGA sensation who regularly attracts huge crowds and has cultivated a fervent emotional connection with the state's GOP base, drawing on her longtime presence in their lives as one of the top news anchors in Arizona's largest market.\n\n\"I told Finchem, I told Blake: Just show up with Kari,\" Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist and a conservative firebrand, tells TIME. \"That's all you need to do. She's getting all the media. She's getting crowds. It would be foolish to do anything else.\"\n\nRead more : How Kari Lake Went From Local Anchor to New Face of the MAGA Right\n\nThey've taken his advice. In Scottsdale, before a packed crowd, they each took the stage one after the other. Signs on the wall read, \"Vote for Lake, Blake, Mark & Abe.\" As is usual for the headliner, Lake came on last and emphasized the importance of electing the other Republicans on the ticket to help enact her agenda.\n\nShe said she needed Masters in the Senate to \"push back against the overreach of the federal government.\" She cast Hamadeh as a core partner who could help her secure the border and combat violent crime. \"I've got to have an attorney general fighting along with me.\" And she extolled Finchem, who rose to prominence as an outspoken voice denying Biden's victory: \"I need that cowboy.\"\n\nRepublicans are betting that the strategy will pay off. While Lake remains in a tight race-she is polling 2.5 percentage points ahead of Hobbs in FiveThirtyEight's polling average -she appears to be a galvanizing force. \"She's got coattails,\" Bannon adds.\n\nIt's not just Lake's fan base that recognizes the trendline. \"When you look at the numbers, especially when we polled the top four races, Kari Lake is unequivocally the anchor,\" Mike Noble, chief researcher at the independent Arizona-based polling group OH Predictive Insights, tells TIME. \"She is Arizona's Donald Trump reincarnate. One hundred percent. She's got that star power.\"\n\nLake's campaign says she is sharing the stage-and thus her avid followers-with the other Republicans to help elevate like-minded insurgent candidates who share her political goals.\n\n\"She does it because electing outsiders up and down the ballot who will relentlessly fight to put Arizona First is the most important thing we can do to save our state,\" a campaign spokesperson tells TIME. \"Career politicians Mark Kelly or Katie Hobbs don't campaign together because they care more about their careers than the future of Arizona. The polls tell them the only thing more toxic than one leftist Democrat is two.\"\n\nBannon pointed to a recent immigration roundtable event that Lake orchestrated in the border town of Sierra Vista with the rest of the Republican slate. \"She was reaching out and bringing them into it, not trying to hog the spotlight like most others would,\" he says. \"She was doing the exact opposite.\"\n\nThe Democrats, on the other hand, are mainly doing their own thing. They have campaigned together on a few occasions, such as when former President Barack Obama came to Arizona last week to energize the party's base. Otherwise, Kelly, Hobbs, secretary of state candidate Adrian Fontes, and attorney general candidate Kris Mayes have largely run separate races.\n\n\"We have been campaigning all over the state, meeting voters directly in their communities and talking about my plans to take Arizona forward,\" Hobbs tells TIME.\n\nSarah Guggenheimer, a spokeswoman for Kelly, frames the Senator's approach to campaigning as a sign of his approach to governing. \"Following in the footsteps of his predecessor Senator John McCain, Senator Kelly has been the independent senator that Arizona deserves, putting the needs of the state ahead of partisan politics,\" she says.\n\nYet some Arizona Democrats have acknowledged that the problem may lie in the party's lack of cohesion. \"There's something to be said for message coordination and message discipline,\" Ron Ober, a veteran Phoenix-based Democratic strategist, tells TIME. The Democrats, he goes on, haven't been \"as coordinated and as crisp as the Republicans have been by running as a team.\"\n\nRight-wing activists have also noted the discrepancy between the two parties, and see it as an advantage with trying to win over the state's independent voters. \"We're able to work together because everyone's getting along,\" Tyler Bower, the chief operating officer of the conservative group Turning Point Action, tells TIME. \"We're able to go out and evangelize to the independent space on a unified message.\"\n\nAlong with the Democrats' go-it-alone approach, the absence from the trail of an Arizona Democrat not even on the ballot this year hasn't gone unnoticed. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has rarely been seen stumping with Kelly or Hobbs. She was conspicuously missing last week when Obama came to rally for them at a high school gymnasium in Laveen Village.\n\nSinema, who joined the Senate in 2019, has been a thorn in the side of her fellow Democrats in the evenly split chamber, where she and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have repeatedly stymied Biden's agenda on taxes, changing the filibuster, and other issues. While Sinema is now loathed by many liberals, she polls well with the up-for-grabs voters Hobbs needs, as 34% of the state's electorate is independent.\n\nSinema has publicly spoken of her support for Kelly and has donated $10,000 to his campaign through her leadership PAC. She also recently said that she voted for Hobbs, but has stopped short of lending her credibility with Arizona's independent voters to Hobbs by campaigning with her. Hobbs' campaign confirmed that Sinema has not donated to her campaign.\n\nSinema's absenteeism this cycle has been notable to Arizona political analysts, given that she and Hobbs have a history. Sinema helped to recruit Hobbs in 2010 to replace her seat in the Arizona House when Sinema ran for the state Senate.\n\n\"You'd think that Kysten Sinema would come to campaign for Katie,\" Dave Wells, an Arizona State University politics professor, tells TIME. \"She's up for reelection in 2024. And it would help her with the Democratic base to see her campaigning for Democrats cause she never seems to do that here.\"\n\nIn response to a question from TIME about why Sinema hasn't been on the trail with Kelly or Hobbs, Hannah Hurley, a spokeswoman for Sinema, responded: \"Kyrsten is working closely with Senator Kelly and is supporting him however he needs and however his campaign thinks is most helpful.\" She did not mention Hobbs.\n\nSome local insiders suspect that Democrats are distancing themselves from Hobbs, who has been seen as running a weaker campaign than Lake. Along with refusing to debate Lake, Hobbs has struggled to explain away a former employee's lawsuit over racial and sexual discrimination, or a recent registration error in the secretary of state's office that could affect up to 6,000 voters.\n\n\"I think that the way it played out certainly is that Hobbs has been a drag on everybody,\" a veteran Arizona Democratic consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak more freely, tells TIME.\n\nBut the lack of coordination is not just from Sinema. Neither Hobbs nor Kelly speak about each others' campaigns much on the stump, or that of Fontes and Mayes.\n\nLake, in contrast, seems to relish the opportunity to boost her fellow Republicans.\n\nAll of them, like her, have Trump's stamp of approval and share many of the same core policy positions, including support for remaking Arizona election laws, enacting more stringent border policies, and castigating the way gender and racial issues are taught in public schools.\n\n\"We've got a great ticket,\" Lake told her supporters on Saturday evening. \"The media has been attacking us. I'll tell you, vote for whoever the media has been attacking.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Kari Lake Preparing to File Election Lawsuit Next Week to Combat Loss\n\nR epublican candidate for governor Kari Lake plans to sue Arizona's largest county next week to overturn her election loss, sources familiar with the matter tell TIME, as the state's election system is beset by turmoil more than three weeks after Election Day.\n\nLake, who lost by less than one percentage point to Democrat Katie Hobbs and has refused to concede, cannot file her lawsuit under Arizona law until state officials certify the election results. That process will take place on Dec. 5, when Arizona's governor, secretary of state, attorney general, and chief justice will validate the election outcome based on official results submitted by the state's 15 counties.\n\nIn the meantime, Lake's legal team has been collecting affidavits from voters who claim they were unable to vote on Election Day because of problems with tabulator machines in roughly 30% of Maricopa County's vote centers, according to Lake campaign insiders.\n\nThe equipment problems led to long lines and voter confusion at those polling places. Maricopa County officials have stressed that no voters were denied the right to vote. Anyone who experienced issues with the machines, they said, was able to deposit their ballot in a secure box to be tabulated later. \"People were still able to vote,\" said Bill Gates, the chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors. \"It was just a matter of maybe not voting in the way they wanted to.\"\n\nLake trails Hobbs by a little more than 17,000 votes. Lake's lawsuit, sources say, is likely to claim that more than that many voters were disenfranchised by Maricopa's tabulator snafus, which they argue had a disparate impact on Republicans, who were more likely to vote in person on Election Day, compared to Democrats, who in recent years have tended to vote early or by mail. It's a trend that is due in large part to former President Donald Trump having falsely demonized mail voting as rife with fraud.\n\nRead more : Trump's Attacks on Mail Voting Bolstered 'Big Lie,' Jan. 6 Panel Says\n\nLake, the former news anchor turned politician, intends to ask the Maricopa County Superior Court to nullify its election and hold it over again. Such a decision would be unprecedented in modern American elections. Some of Lake's top advisers recognize that the chances of a judge ruling in their favor are slim. \"Courts require proof,\" a Lake insider tells TIME. \"And it's going to be hard to prove. You don't know how many people actually drove to a polling location, looked at the long line, and left. You'll never know who decided not to pull in. And that's unfortunate for Kari. We can just argue common sense. But that's not evidence in court. It's going to be tough.\"\n\nOn social media, Lake has said her lawsuit will include \"at least one smoking gun\" based on whistleblowers who have contacted her campaign. \"I'm working with a team of patriotic, talented lawyers on a legal case to challenge the botched elections,\" she said in one video. \"We will file this case in accordance with Arizona state law, and you'll want to stay tuned for this one. Trust me.\"\n\nLake is being represented by the Phoenix-based conservative lawyer Tim La Sota, and sources say there are conversations ongoing with the Republican National Committee to potentially join in the lawsuit. Lake's campaign had hired Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC committeewoman who helped with Trump's efforts to contest the 2020 election, to run its election week operations.\n\nRepublican candidates who have said without evidence that Trump won in 2020 ran across the country in this year's midterms. Nearly all who have lost have conceded, making Lake the most high-profile holdout.\n\nLocal officials in all of Arizona counties convened on Monday to approve their respective election results, but those typically mundane proceedings were far more dramatic than usual in some counties. The Republican-controlled Cochise County governing board voted two-to-one to delay a vote on certifying their results until Friday, a move that risks delaying the statewide certification and that quickly drew lawsuits from outside groups and Hobbs in her role as secretary of state. In Mohave County, the Republican chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Ron Gould, reluctantly certified the election results but only \"under duress,\" he said, proclaiming from the dais: \"I have no choice but to vote 'Aye' or I will be arrested and charged with a felony.\"\n\nAnd in Maricopa County, which comprises more than 60% of the state's voters, hundreds protested the Board of Supervisors' certification meeting, with many testifying about their grievances over Election Day issues with technical glitches and long lines. The board eventually voted unanimously to certify the election results.\n\nProblems with the machine tabulators emerged early in the morning on Election Day at 70 of Maricopa's 223 vote centers; by midday, county officials said they had diagnosed and remedied the problem.\n\nOne longtime Arizona politico acknowledged that the problems were disruptive, but insisted that they did not ultimately disenfranchise Arizona voters. \"Were there some inconveniences? Yeah, absolutely,\" Barrett Marson, a veteran Arizona Republican operative, tells TIME. \"Did Maricopa County make a mistake? Absolutely. But did they rectify it as soon as possible? Absolutely. Did people have to wait in long lines to vote? Yes, but they voted. That's Kari Lake's problem. People were still allowed to vote.\"\n\nDuring the public comment period on Monday at the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors meeting, Lake supporters one by one excoriated the county, in some cases citing unsubstantiated claims that the technological hiccups were part of an intentional plot to steal the election. \"This is a war between good and evil,\" one man told the board, \"and you all represent evil.\"\n\nOver and over again, those who spoke expressed that they had little faith that the election was fair. One of the speakers, who works for a right-wing media outlet, suggested that Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, was compromised in his role because he founded a political action committee last year called Pro-Democracy Republicans of Arizona to combat GOP candidates who say the last presidential election was stolen, despite multiple investigations finding no evidence of substantial fraud. Lake has often said that Joe Biden is an \"illegitimate\" president who did not really beat Trump in 2020. Richer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne woman who served as a poll observer testified that they weren't trained to check out voters who had already checked in at a polling place. That became an issue for some voters who had tabulator machines reject their ballots and who wanted to go to another location to vote. Another said she heard from a fellow poll worker that one of the tabulators at her polling place wasn't working the night before the election.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich's office cited the tabulator malfunctions and check-out issues prominently in a Nov. 19 letter to Maricopa County demanding answers on the Election Day mishaps. \"These complaints go beyond pure speculation, but include first-hand witness accounts that raise concerns regarding Maricopa's lawful compliance with Arizona election law,\" the attorney general's office wrote.\n\nMaricopa County officials responded on Nov. 27, saying the county complied with federal and state election law, and that voters who went to a second polling place on Election Day without checking out of the previous polling place were able to cast a provisional ballot. Elections officials would then research to make sure that the voter did not vote twice before counting that ballot. The letter did not address the training of poll workers for check-out procedures.\n\nBrnovich's shadow looms large in the ongoing controversy over the 2022 Arizona election, as he is one of the state officials tasked with certifying the election next week. While the Republican attorney general certified and defended the integrity of the last Arizona election two years ago, he later cast doubt on its legitimacy when he ran for U.S. Senate this year. Brnovich has not made any public declaration on whether he will certify this election. His office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Hobbs, as secretary of state, has engaged in a legal battle to compel Cochise County to certify its election results as mandated by state law, after its Board of Supervisors refused to do so, citing concerns with voting machines, even though voters did not experience issues in that jurisdiction. \"The Secretary of State's Office provided supporting documentation that confirmed Cochise County's election equipment was properly certified,\" a spokesperson for Hobbs tells TIME. \"The Board of Supervisors had all of the information they needed to certify this election and failed to uphold their responsibility for Cochise voters.\"\n\nSince the Associated Press called the election for Hobbs on Nov. 14, Lake has vowed to fight the results of what she has called a \"shoddy election\" and has emphasized to her supporters that she will challenge the outcome.\n\n\"This whole system is a joke,\" she told a conservative podcast host on Tuesday. \"Either our courts help us out right now, or I feel we lose this country.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "In Arizona, Kari Lake and Katie Hobbs Prepare for Potential Legal Battle Over Ballots\n\nA day after the polls closed, the Arizona governor's race remained neck-and-neck, with both Democrat Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake waiting for hundreds of thousands of ballots to be counted. But as the final batches of votes are tallied, there remains a possible legal fight looming in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nThe Lake campaign has made clear it is prepared to pursue legal action over the election, potentially over the counting of ballots and the observation of that process, according to sources familiar with the matter. A member of Lake's legal team who requested anonymity tells TIME that \"a subject matter of a lawsuit\" could be \"the counting of the ballots and the monitoring of the counting.\" They wouldn't say whether any specific suits were planned as of yet.\n\nSuch an action could ultimately focus on the final batch of ballots-roughly 290,000 mail ballots that were delivered in person on Election Day-that will be counted over the next several days.\n\n\"We've said from the beginning that this was going to be a tight race,\" Nicole DeMont, campaign manager for the Hobbs campaign, said in a statement. \"Each and every Arizonan deserves to have their ballot counted and their voice heard, and in the days to come we will continue to watch these results closely to make sure that happens.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state, was leading Lake by a little more than 13,000 votes with roughly 70% of the ballots counted. Hobbs took a commanding lead on Tuesday night after winning the early mail-in votes by roughly 14 percentage points. Lake then closed the gap through her lead with voters who cast ballots in person on Election Day.\n\nThat leaves those roughly 290,000 ballots from Arizonans who voted absentee but who either dropped off their ballots on Election Day or whose ballots arrived by mail on Election Day. An Arizona election official familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the governor's race expected those votes to be split evenly between Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.\n\nArizona Republicans, however, are banking on those ballots leaning toward Lake. They say that many Republicans stayed on the absentee voter rolls after 2020 but weren't comfortable mailing in their ballots or voting early. It's a trend that remains a legacy of former President Donald Trump's bashing of voting by mail as being rife with fraud, despite no substantial evidence to support that claim, which he became especially vocal about two years ago, as many states expanded mail voting to facilitate elections amid the pandemic.\n\nThe Hobbs campaign informed its supporters on Wednesday that it's embarking on a process to reach out to Arizonans who voted absentee but who then received a notice that their ballot wouldn't be processed until a problem was addressed, what's known as the \"cures process\" in elections parlance.\n\nA Hobbs campaign spokesperson confirmed to TIME that the campaign is being represented by the Elias Law Group, a Washington D.C.-based firm headed by the Democratic Party's leading elections attorney.\n\n\"Because every single vote matters, and every single vote counts equally-whether you voted by mail, dropped off your ballot at a secure drop box yesterday, or voted in person,\" the Hobbs campaign wrote in an email to supporters on Wednesday. \"That's why our focus is now turning to ballot curing-contacting voters who may have had an issue with their ballots-to make sure all voices are heard in this race.\"\n\nAn Arizona elections official explained that this was a common process in vote counting. It generally applies to voters who either forgot to include a signature on their ballot or who may have made a mistake like signing a spouse's ballot instead of their own. These errors are caught because of signature-verification technology used to ensure a signature on a ballot matches the one on a voter's registration.\n\nIn Arizona, monitors are allowed in the room for the cures process to ensure faith in the system. The Lake campaign has indicated that it is prepared to deploy lawyers to observe the process-and potentially take legal action if they see something they don't like.\n\nAhead of the election, the Lake campaign pumped $2 million to create and staff an election week \"War Room\" to monitor the election and vote-counting process, and file lawsuits at the drop of the hat, according to a campaign official. The effort includes roughly 40 lawyers in a conference space in a Scottsdale hotel, as well as a team of what the campaign has called \"roving lawyers\" dispatched to polling places and vote-counting centers throughout the week.\n\n\"This is the most robust Election Day operation and post-election operation that Arizona has ever seen,\" Brady Smith, the Lake campaign's chief political strategist, tells TIME.\n\nFunding for the effort, Smith says, came from several sources, including the Lake campaign, the Republican National Committee, the Arizona Republican Party, the National Republican Senate Committee, and Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters' campaign.\n\nBoth Lake and Masters have been outspoken voices casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 election, including President Joe Biden's Arizona victory, despite multiple investigations finding no evidence of substantial fraud.\n\nThe War Room unit created several channels for voters to report irregularities, including a hotline and a web portal that allows users to sign affidavits digitally. Lake promoted the site on her social media accounts in the days leading up to the election.\n\n\"Those are all being utilized, and our attorneys are responding rapidly to address issues and concerns as they pop up,\" Smith says.\n\nBoth the Lake and Masters campaigns joined the RNC in a lawsuit filed in Maricopa County court on Tuesday to extend the voting times there in response to problems with about 20% of the machine tabulators used to scan ballots at polling places in the morning. By midday, county officials said they had identified and fixed the problem. The judge denied the GOP request, saying that the issue didn't result in voters not being able to cast ballots and have those ballots counted. In 2016, the Arizona Democratic Party filed a similar lawsuit to extend voting times, which was also denied.\n\nRead more : Problems With Some Arizona Voting Machines Are Stoking Right-Wing Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe Lake campaign legal source suggested that, if the counts are close, they may request a hand count, rather than using machines, noting that hand counts often produce different results.\n\nThe Arizona elections official did not dispute that machine counting and hand counting often does result in different final vote counts, but said the discrepancy was usually marginal. They also stressed that machines tended to be more accurate and less susceptible to human error.\n\nYet if the remaining ballots pan out as Lake campaign officials hope and expect, they may be less likely to embark on a legal battle. \"Wow,\" Lake tweeted Wednesday afternoon. \"We're going to win big.

      "text": "Katie Hobbs Defeats Trump-Backed Kari Lake in Race for Arizona Governor\n\nA fter a bruising election in which she was tarred by both her allies and adversaries for running a lackluster campaign, Democrat Katie Hobbs pulled off a come-from-behind victory against Republican Kari Lake to clinch the Arizona governor's office, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe AP called the race Monday night after Arizona's most populous county released a new batch of roughly 71,000 votes, inching closer to completing the count. Most of those were mail ballots hand delivered on Election Day, which the Lake campaign was relying on to close the gap. Lake had been banking on the expectation that those voters would lean in her favor, as former President Donald Trump won most voters who dropped off their mail ballots on Election Day in 2020 and analysts estimated that there were a substantial percentage of GOP voters who stayed on the absentee rolls but who didn't trust mailing them in or depositing them in drop boxes.\n\nUltimately, those hopes faded when Monday's ballot drop did not provide Lake with enough votes to surpass Hobbs' lead.\n\nThe contest for Arizona governor was defined in large part over the two candidates' dueling stances on the last election. Hobbs, as Arizona's secretary of state, gained notoriety two years ago for resisting a pressure campaign by Trump and his allies to decertify Biden's win and defending the integrity of Arizona's elections. Lake, in contrast, was outspoken in claiming that Biden did not legitimately win Arizona, despite multiple investigations having found no evidence of substantial fraud.\n\nLate Monday evening, Lake suggested she might not graciously accept the results of her own loss either. \"Arizonans know BS when they see it,\" she tweeted to her nearly 700,000 followers. A Lake campaign source tells TIME that Lake, who staffed a \" War Room \" with dozens of lawyers ahead of the election, was \"wound up\" throughout the day and that her advisers had been discussing potential litigation over problems with tabulators used to scan ballots at polling places in Maricopa County on Election Day.\n\nHobbs' victory is part of a nationwide wipe-out in the midterms of GOP gubernatorial candidates who embraced the former president baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, including Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania and Tudor Dixon in Michigan.\n\nHobbs also campaigned as a good-government liberal who would work to reduce poverty and expand voting access. She championed a series of state-level tax credits for low-income families, and she vowed to try and restore the right to an abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade . Since the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 ruling in June, Arizona has been mired in a legal dispute over which law is in effect: a total ban on the procedure from 1964 or a 15-week ban signed into law this year by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nHobbs, 52, also sought to characterize her opponent as an \"extremist\" who could not be trusted with the powers and responsibilities of the governor's office. \"Our race for governor isn't about Democrats vs. Republicans,\" Hobbs told TIME last month. \"It's about sanity vs. chaos.\"\n\nLake, the former local news anchor who parlayed her built-in following and media acumen into a political career, became a right-wing sensation who would regularly draw huge crowds. She often went viral by lambasting old colleagues in the press, and sometimes manufacturing feisty clashes with reporters. Political pundits saw her as a potent threat to the soft-spoken Hobbs.\n\nRead more : How Kari Lake Went From Local Anchor to New Face of the MAGA Right\n\nOne of Hobbs' most controversial decisions over the campaign was to refuse to debate Lake. Hobbs said her opponent would use the opportunity to create a spectacle and \"spread conspiracy theories.\" The former social worker's reluctance to go toe-to-toe with Lake on a debate stage was widely cast in the press as a cowardly move that could cost her the election.\n\nAt the same time, Hobbs was hobbled by a former employee's lawsuit over racial and sexual discrimination-leading Lake to brand her opponent a \"twice-convicted racist\"-and a recent registration error in the secretary of state's office that stood to affect nearly 6,000 voters.\n\nIn the end, though, Hobbs surmounted those challenges to defeat a controversial candidate who not only made waves by casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 election, but who planned to embark on an aggressive, boundary-pushing populist conservative agenda while in office.\n\nLake vowed to issue a Declaration of Invasion over the border, root out \"woke teaching\" from schools, and block vaccine mandates of any kind. She also planned to engage the Biden administration in a series of legal fights-on everything from education to immigration-with the goal of engineering favorable rulings from a conservative Supreme Court.\n\nLake's Arizona loss didn't happen in a vacuum. The other Trump-aligned candidates on the statewide ballot lost by even larger margins, including Blake Masters for U.S. Senate and Mark Finchem for Secretary of State.\n\nThe Republican running for statewide office who had the strongest showing in Arizona was Kimberly Yee, who won re-election as state treasurer and who Trump didn't endorse. As of Monday night, Yee was leading by nearly 260,000 votes. While she was the only incumbent running statewide, Arizona politicos saw it as a telling sign that many Republicans and independents voted for her and not the rest of the MAGA slate. \"Some Republicans are voting for Yee to ensure that the Lake cartel clearly sees their collective middle finger,\" Steve May, a former Arizona state legislator, tells TIME.\n\nThe Arizona governor's race began in chaotic fashion last Tuesday, when more than 20% of tabulators in Maricopa County had problems scanning ballots, leading to voter frustration and the promulgation of false theories on the internet of voter suppression directly targeted toward Republicans. By midday, county officials had diagnosed and fixed the problem.\n\nMaricopa County makes up more than 60% of the state's registered voters, and since the 2020 election, Republicans across the country have overwhelmingly preferred to vote in person on Election Day. But while such tabulation snafus had the potential to disenfranchise more conservative voters, no evidence has emerged to show that any votes were prevented from being counted by night's end.\n\nThe election, instead, rested on what are known in Arizona as \"late earlies\"-an oxymoronic term that refers to mail ballots that voters deliver in person on Election Day.\n\nWhile mail ballots returned early are usually processed and tabulated before Election Day, that process doesn't typically begin for \"late earlies\" until the day after the election, when they go through signature verification and other authorization processes to ensure their legitimacy.\n\nThis year, Maricopa County received roughly 290,000 such ballots-more than 70% more than two years ago. That led to an excruciatingly long vote count that right-wing media figures portrayed as either a sign of incompetence or malfeasance. It was neither. Arizona's election workers were operating under the confines of election laws passed by Republicans in the state legislature.\n\nOther states that counted votes faster don't allow for mail ballots to be delivered as easily on Election Day. Florida, for instance, only allows voters to drop off mail ballots at county elections offices on Election Day, not polling places all across the state.\n\nThat discrepancy may also account, in part, for Arizona having a higher turnout level than Florida. Fifty-nine percent of Arizona's registered voters cast ballots in 2020, whereas 57 percent of Florida's did. The two-percentage-point point difference in turnout can be decisive in races as close as the one between Hobbs and Lake.\n\nAs of Monday night, Lake had yet to concede, as many of her detractors feared after she refused to tell CNN last month whether she would accept the outcome if she lost. \"I'm going to win,\" she said, \"and I will accept that result.\"\n\nBy Monday evening, though, Lake campaign insiders had seemed to accept her loss. \"Maybe she'll run again for something,\" one of them tells TIME. \"Who knows?\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Plenty of Voters Care About Democracy. It's Still Probably Not Enough.\n\nD emocrats and defenders of small-d democracy across the country continue to rejoice as nearly every election denier on the ballot to oversee 2024 elections in swing states has been declared a loser. Stories trumpeting American voters' wisdom in rejecting Trump-backed conspiracists in secretary of state races dominate the national conversation, relegating even Kari Lake's \"will she won't she\" concession story out of Arizona to a mere subplot.\n\nAt the risk of being the turd in the punchbowl, it's possible we may be overstating the significance of these results for the future health of American democracy.\n\nThese outcomes, though a tremendous relief, are as much a product of Democrats' go-for-broke, shock-and-awe national campaign strategy than they are a repudiation of election denialism. Indeed, two of the most strident election deniers in the bunch, Jim Marchant and Mark Finchem, lost far less decisively than one might expect. Consider: they ran unhinged, anti-democratic campaigns that likely suppressed their base's turnout; they faced high quality opponents with colossal fundraising and spending advantages. So why weren't Marchant and Finchem trounced? Donald Trump can surely take some credit. The rest, however, is thanks to the hyper-partisan, nationalized nature of our politics, from which no area of governing is immune, including the traditionally apolitical issue of election administration.\n\nOver the past decade, as polarization between the two major parties has deepened, their positions on how to conduct elections have drifted further apart and hardened. As Republican state officials promoted tighter controls on voting-from stricter voter ID requirements to voter roll purges-Democrats in many states responded by pushing for easier access to the ballot box. These earlier partisan fights paved the way for the Republican Party's embrace of Donald Trump's discredited claims of election rigging, which, along with the pandemic, turned the primarily administrative office of secretary of state into a lightning rod for national partisan controversy.\n\nWhen Covid-19 collided with the 2020 primary election season, secretaries of state across the country rushed to scale their mail voting infrastructure or provide technical assistance to their counterparts with less mail voting experience, all the while leading highly-publicized outreach campaigns to inform voters about their ballot access options and the reliability and partisan neutrality of voting by mail.\n\nThey did an exemplary job, playing a leading role in what election security officials have called \" the most secure election in U.S. history .\" Yet their messages about mail voting failed to break through to millions of Republicans. Years of disinformation targeting government combined with an increasingly polarized and polarizing media environment primed the majority of Republican voters-and nearly half of GOP candidates in last Tuesday's midterms-to believe or at least entertain the \"Big Lie.\"\n\nIf not for Trump, what secretaries of state pulled off in 2020 would be widely remembered as a shining example of government competency-something we sorely need in an era of record low trust in institutions. Instead, the office of secretary of state became yet another casualty of hyperpartisan polarization and the nationalization of state and local politics.\n\nWhile the midterm results offer hope that Trump's spell over his party is not absolute, the legacy of \"Stop the Steal\" will continue to haunt election administration and administrators. For example, a whopping 148 bills were filed by Republican state legislatures in 2021 that would strip election officials of their usual powers, and even more have been filed this year. And since 2020, Republican voters' suspicions toward the electoral process have only grown, especially toward mail voting. Early analysis from this year's midterms suggests that these doubts, which were egged on by GOP candidates, probably depressed Republican turnout, making it all the more unsettling that Marchant and Finchem came so close.\n\nThe post-2020 frenzy also led to a surge in national attention on secretaries of state that is both unusual and unhealthy for the body politic. Powerful as most secretaries of state are-overseeing elections and voter registration in 37 states -their duties are state-centered and mainly administrative. As such, secretaries of state tend to be more technocratic and civic-minded. They're also more likely to be women than their fellow state executives. According to Rutgers' Center for American Women in Politics database, 135 women have served as secretary of state in American history, compared to just 45 female governors and 41 attorneys general. Perhaps not coincidentally, secretaries of state also have been less likely to go on to serve in higher offices than fellow state executives. Before 2020, these characteristics kept both the office and its occupants out of the national spotlight. (Notable exceptions include Brian Kemp in 2018, and Katherine Harris in 2000.)\n\nIn some cases, this newfound attention on secretaries of state and election workers has manifested in threats of violence . In others, like in this year's midterms, the attention has come in the form of unprecedented campaign spending for secretary of state campaigns in swing states.\n\nFundraising for six close secretary of state contests more than doubled since 2018, driven in large part by out-of-state contributions , a trend which the Brennan Center attributes to the increased nationalization of these elections. Democratic groups were especially aggressive in their efforts to counter the threat posed by the America First Secretary of State Coalition . The coalition's all-Republican members campaigned on election \"reform\" goals such as erasing voter rolls and forcing voters to re-register, rewriting state elections procedures, decimating early and mail voting, ditching vote tabulation machines in favor of all hand counting, and refusing to certify results they dislike. Despite their radical positions, and the fact that they spent next to nothing on advertising after the primaries, pre-election polling showed a number of these candidates leading or within striking distance of their Democratic opponents.\n\nIn response, Democratic Association of Secretary of State and affiliated groups spent upwards of $24 million- eight times what they spent in 2018-to defeat these extremists. On TV ads alone, Democrats outspent Republicans 57-1 to defend their candidates, according to the NYT. Democratic secretary of state candidates also had the backing of celebrities like former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and actress Kerry Washington , and even pro-democracy Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney pitched in. Without this unprecedented investment of money and star power in secretary of state races, it's easy to imagine some of them ending differently.\n\nFor state down ballot races to attract such huge sums of campaign money and media attention is uncommon, but it's becoming less so as more state and local campaigns are subsumed under the major parties' national platforms and framed in existential terms. Such is the \" two-party doom loop ,\" as my colleague Lee Drutman calls it, that these conflicts will only continue to escalate and infect new corners of democratic life until we make serious structural changes to our elections. Reforms like ranked-choice voting, proportional representation, and fusion voting have the potential to scramble America's toxic zero-sum approach to politics that fuels negative partisanship and rewards extremism rather than compromise. Unfortunately, despite steady advances for ranked-choice voting in particular, these changes are not likely to be implemented any time soon.\n\nSecretaries of state are the quiet engines that keep our democracy running. Their elections always mattered, even when we weren't paying attention. This year, however, the stakes were too high to ignore, and voters across the U.S. took notice, defeating almost every election denier who sought the job. That's the good news. The bad news is that we had to work this hard to do it, and chances are it will not be the last time.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "The 10 Races That Will Determine Control of the Senate\n\nA s the presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris remains tightly contested, the battle for Senate control is equally competitive, hinging on a handful of critical races across key states.\n\nWith 34 Senate seats up for election this November, Democrats are focused on defending their slim majority. Currently holding 51 seats, they face the prospect of losing a seat in red West Virginia that has been occupied by Sen. Joe Manchin since 2010. If that happens, Republicans would need just one additional victory to reclaim control of the chamber, provided they manage to avoid any upsets elsewhere.\n\nThe stakes are incredibly high. The party that controls the Senate will have power over the next president's legislative agenda, Cabinet appointments, judicial nominations, and more.\n\nHere's a closer look at the ten key races that will determine control of the Senate.\n\nMontana's Senate race is shaping up to be a critical test for Democratic incumbent Jon Tester, who faces a tough re-election campaign against Republican nominee Tim Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL backed by Trump.\n\nIn a state that Trump won by 16 points in 2020, Tester's incumbency has given him a slight boost, but he will need to appeal to a diverse electorate, including independents and moderate Republicans. The most recent Emerson College poll-from early August-showed Sheehy ahead of Tester by just two points. (Montana is not polled very often as it's not a presidential swing state).\n\nMany political analysts consider Montana's race to be the most critical bellwether contest for determining control of the Senate this cycle. The Cook Political Report recently shifted its rating of the race from toss-up to 'Leans Republican,' while other analysts are waiting for more reliable polling data. Tester has defied the odds before, winning red Montana in 2006, 2012, and 2018-all strong Democratic cycles. Lately he has leaned more into the abortion rights issue, which is on the ballot in Montana this year. His campaign has also focused on Sheehy's use of racial stereotypes to refer to Native Americans-a small but important voting bloc in Montana-while Sheehy aims to portray Tester as an out-of-touch Washington politician tied to the national Democratic brand. (Tester has not endorsed a candidate for President.)\n\nAll eyes will be on battleground Michigan this November-and not just for the presidential election. The high-stakes race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is shaping up to be one of the most competitive in the nation, with the potential to tip the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nA September New York Times /Siena College poll shows that Democrat Elissa Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, currently holds a narrow five-point lead over former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers. But unlike all the other Democratic candidates in key races on this list, Slotkin is getting a lower share of the vote than Harris, suggesting that Michigan could present the toughest challenge for Democrats to run ahead of the presidential race.\n\nGiven that neither of the candidates are well-known incumbents, their success largely hinges on how Harris and Trump perform in the \"blue wall\" state that Trump won in 2016 but Biden carried in 2020. Rogers, who was once a Trump critic but later won his endorsement, has been hitting Slotkin on inflation and the southern border, claiming she's part of a \"Biden-Harris-Slotkin\" regime. Slotkin, meanwhile, has positioned herself as the \"normal\" and \"rational\" candidate. Like many Democrats, she has made abortion central to her campaign , running ads highlighting Rogers' past support for abortion restrictions.\n\nBoth candidates have national security backgrounds, with Rogers having served in the FBI and as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, and Slotkin having worked for the CIA and in the Pentagon. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record, with her campaign reporting $18 million raised in the third quarter. Republicans have also made significant investments in the state, with the Senate Leadership Fund committing $22.5 million to support Rogers.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year. His re-election bid against Republican nominee Bernie Moreno, a wealthy businessman and Trump ally, is considered a toss-up. Trump is expected to carry the state in the presidential race, while Brown is currently holding a four-point lead, according to a September New York Times /Siena College poll. The good news for Democrats is that Brown, a well-funded three-term Senator, is winning 10% of Trump voters, according to the same poll, and has a history of performing better than the overall Democratic statewide ticket; in 2018, he won by a little under seven points while other statewide Democratic candidates lost by roughly three to six points.\n\nBut Republicans believe their candidate can edge ahead of Brown by nationalizing the race. In one of Moreno's recent ads, he touts his endorsement from Trump and ties Brown's record on immigration to Harris'. Democrats, meanwhile, believe they can win Ohio by building off of Brown's reputation as a champion for working-class voters. Brown's campaign has capitalized on Moreno's recent comments questioning why older women care about abortion, airing ads that highlight his own support for abortion access in a state where a ballot measure to protect reproductive rights passed with 57% support last year.\n\nWith substantial fundraising on both sides-total ad spending in Ohio surpassed $300 million-this Senate contest is ranked by AdImpact as the most expensive congressional race in the country.\n\nIn Wisconsin's Senate race, Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin maintains a seven-point lead over Republican nominee Eric Hovde, according to a September New York Times /Siena College poll. Baldwin, the first out gay member of the Senate , has been a fixture in Wisconsin politics for more than two decades and has consistently out-fundraised Hovde, who has the resources to self-finance his campaign.\n\nHovde, a banker and businessman, has attempted to frame Baldwin as out of touch with Wisconsin values, particularly on issues like border security and transgender rights. Baldwin, on the other hand, has made an effort to connect with rural voters and has received endorsements from groups like the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation. Polls show that Baldwin is receiving a higher share of the vote than Harris, who is leading the crucial swing state by just 1.5 points, according to 538's polling average .\n\nThere's little room for error in the Keystone State, where its 19 electoral votes and contested Senate race between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick could play a decisive role in November. Casey's lead has fluctuated between two to nine points in various polls , though a CNN/SSRS poll in early September showed the presidential and Senate races tied in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe contest has become increasingly contentious as spending ramps up. Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have bombarded Pennsylvania with television ads, pouring $954 million across the commonwealth -more money than any other state this election cycle, according to AdImpact. The heavy presidential investment in Pennsylvania could help boost the Senate candidates, who have focused on contrasting their positions on issues like inflation and abortion. Casey's campaign has spotlighted McCormick's anti-abortion stance, while McCormick has sought to tie Casey to the Biden-Harris Administration. McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO who funded his campaign with his own money, lost a close Republican Senate primary to television doctor Mehmet Oz last cycle after he failed to win Trump's backing. While the former President now supports him, Democrats have used some of his past attacks on McCormick in their ads to help Casey, a three-term Senator.\n\nIn Arizona, the contest to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema , an independent who caucuses with Democrats, has become a focal point for both parties. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego currently holds a substantial lead, polling 10 to 13 points ahead of Republican Kari Lake , who is a polarizing figure after her gubernatorial loss and persistent false claims of election fraud. Lake's campaign has attempted to pivot away from her spurious claims about election integrity, focusing on issues like inflation and immigration. But Lake has been consistently polling behind Trump, who leads in Arizona by just under two points according to 538's polling average .\n\nDemocrats believe Gallego's efforts to position himself as a pragmatic, experienced leader with a Harvard education and combat experience in Iraq are resonating, particularly with Latino voters. He has slammed Lake for her past support for banning abortion and for continuing to falsely claim the 2022 election was stolen, while Lake has painted Gallego as a far-left radical who voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, which she is labeling the \"Kamala Inflation Act\" since she cast the tie-breaking vote. While the contest in Arizona doesn't appear as close as some of the other races on this list, the state has a large portion of independent voters that will likely decide the result. An abortion-related referendum will also be on the state ballot, which could boost Gallego.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen's re-election campaign in Nevada is proving more secure than expected against Republican challenger Sam Brown. Recent polling indicates Rosen leading between seven and 10 points, buoyed by her incumbency and strong fundraising efforts. Brown, a West Point graduate and Army veteran who was severely burned in 2008 in Afghanistan when a roadside bomb exploded, has struggled to gain traction with Republican voters despite a compelling personal story.\n\nRosen has capitalized on the abortion issue, which is on the ballot in Nevada, highlighting her commitment to reproductive rights. Brown has said that he supports current state law legalizing abortion up to 24 weeks and would \"close the door\" on a federal abortion ban in the Senate. He and his wife even shared a personal story of her having an abortion as a young woman. (Democrats have pointed out that in a past race, Brown supported banning the procedure except in the case of a mother's life being at risk).\n\nDemocrats are making a significant push to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, turning up the heat in what many pollsters consider a sleeper race that could upend expectations. Rep. Colin Allred, the Democratic candidate who is outraising Cruz, has gained momentum in recent months as he highlights issues related to abortion rights and border security, hoping to appeal to independents and moderates who are disenchanted with Cruz. A statewide poll by Morning Consult in September found that Allred is polling ahead of Cruz for the first time this cycle, while other polls show him trailing within a margin of error.\n\nIf Democrats can make a real run at Texas, it would allow them more room to keep the Senate even if they lose Montana. The last time a Democrat won a Senate seat in Texas was in 1988, though Democrat Beto O'Rourke came within three points of Cruz in 2018. Democrats are hoping that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat and would be the state's first Black senator if he wins, can be the one to change that.\n\nThe election has been cast by many as a referendum on Cruz, who has struggled with popularity in Texas. Allred has accused Cruz of \"doing nothing to secure the border,\" flipping the script on Republicans and blaming him for blocking the Senate's bipartisan border deal earlier this year. Allred has also hit Cruz on abortion; an ad put out by his campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) featuring Kate Cox , who had to leave Texas to seek an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after being denied an abortion despite facing complications, has received attention. \"If you're experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you're in danger,\" Zurawski says in the ad, \"and it's Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists' fault.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cruz has resurfaced comments that Allred made during the Trump Administration calling a border wall \"racist,\" which Allred said was taken out of context. Cruz has also targeted Allred for his support of legislation that would have banned LGBTQ discrimination in public places and his vote against a bill that would cut off federal funds for athletic programs that allow transgender athletes in women's sports. \"Boys and girls are different,\" one of Cruz's ads begins.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Allred can capitalize on the dissatisfaction with Cruz to turn Texas blue, but his fundraising efforts so far have been striking: He brought in more than $1 million in a day twice in the third quarter, his campaign says .\n\nTypically a Democratic stronghold, Maryland is witnessing a surprising challenge by Republican nominee Larry Hogan, the popular two-term governor whose moderate appeal and high-profile endorsements are expected to keep this race in play for Republicans. Still, Democrat Angela Alsobrooks , the Prince George's County Executive, holds a sizable lead for Maryland's open Senate seat, which has been held by Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin since 2007. A recent Washington Post -University of Maryland poll shows Alsobrooks leading by 11 points, while Maryland-based pollster Patrick Gonzales had her up five points. AARP's bipartisan polling team, however, found the Maryland Senate race tied at 46% even though Harris led the presidential race by about 30 points in the poll.\n\nHogan, who has a track record of bipartisanship and rejected Trump's endorsement earlier this year, has been polling well with Democratic voters. He's expected to perform better than Trump in the state, but most analysts are skeptical that it will be enough to counter Alsobrooks, a former prosecutor and Harris ally who would be Maryland's first Black senator if elected. Biden won the state by 33 points in 2020.\n\nA potential dark horse of the 2024 cycle, Democratic hopes in Florida hinge on former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who served one term in the House after the 2018 blue wave and is challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott, the former two-term governor and Trump ally. Scott maintains a solid foothold in the state, which Trump carried by three points in 2020, but is only narrowly ahead of Mucarsel-Powell in most polls. An early September poll by Emerson College showed that Scott is leading by just one point, while a Morning Consult poll published just under two weeks later had him up four points.\n\nWith Florida being a potential-but unlikely-swing state, Democrats are hoping they can rally voters around key issues like healthcare and abortion rights. For Mucarsel-Powell to win, she will likely need to appeal to disenchanted voters who may have previously supported Scott. But with Florida's substantial population of conservative-leaning retirees, many analysts say the state remains right-of-center this election cycle. Scott has also outraised Mucarsel-Powell by $30 million (including $14 million in self-funding) to $14 million. His self-funding helped him win razor-thin gubernatorial and Senate victories in 2010, 2014, and 2018.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "Kari Lake: Interviewing the election denier who ran for Arizona governor\n\nAn election-denying former journalist wanted to be the next governor of Arizona. But does Kari Lake truly believe in what she's campaigned on?\n\nIt was 54C (130F), but Kari Lake was cool as a cucumber.\n\nHer immaculate hair-do and pristine make-up had somehow defied the sweaty ravages of the summer heat.\n\nLake spent 22 years as a TV anchor on Arizona's local Fox 10 news channel before jumping into politics with a run for Arizona governor this year, and her poised on-air persona has been one of her most powerful political weapons.\n\nI met Lake this summer at a coffee morning hosted at a retirement community in Wickenburg, a couple of hours north of Phoenix. Lake had driven out there to campaign, soliciting votes and donations, from this critical group of constituents. She invited us to join them.\n\nNo Republican can hope to win state-wide office in Arizona without the support of older white voters, and in the pristine house on Tenderfoot Way, that's exactly what she found.\n\nMy crew and I arrived before Lake, and the room of a few dozen supporters was already buzzing with anticipation. They recognise Lake from her years reading the news; she's a celebrity in Arizona, and they were very excited to meet her. One elderly woman told me she only hoped Lake would be as glamorous in the flesh as she was on TV.\n\nAnd when the TV anchor turned conservative firebrand finally arrived she didn't disappoint.\n\nLake is a real pro at working a room. Those years performing for the camera have served her well, and she walked in confidently, with a wide smile. \"Oh my gosh, how are you?\" she beamed. \"Nice to see you, hi everyone. Gorgeous neighbourhood but even better looking people.\"\n\nIf it was a bit canned, they didn't seem to mind. She'd been in the room less than a minute and had them eating out of her hand. I felt I was watching a master-class in retail politics.\n\nLake had a smile for everyone. Except me. She doesn't like journalists - which is odd since she was one for so long.\n\n\"I made a very difficult decision to walk away from my career,\" she explained. \"I realised the work had become immoral. The field has gone full propaganda, and they are lying to the people. So I decided to throw my hat into the ring.\"\n\nShe paused for the applause and then a sly dig. \"And, you know, we've got the media here. I'm about to do an interview with them, and I do hope they're fair.\" More applause.\n\nFor the next fifteen minutes Lake told this group of conservative voters what she planned to do if they elected her as governor. Her list included banning abortion, banning \"woke\" ideology in schools, clamping down on illegal immigration and litigating the 2020 election results.\n\n\"Without honest elections and a secure border, we no longer have a country and we're not going to let Arizona go,\" she said.\n\nThat didn't just get applause, it got appreciative whistles too.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Lake won Donald Trump's endorsement by placing herself on the conservative wing of the Republican party, and more importantly, by claiming the 2020 election was stolen (though there is no evidence that it was). Her political ideology is right in line with that of his supporters.\n\nBy and large, this Republican women's coffee morning was happy with what they heard. Their only real concern was whether she was conservative enough.\n\nThe TV anchor once donated to one Barack Obama when he was running for president in 2008, and this crowd wanted to know if she was worthy of Donald Trump's endorsement. \"Being new to this party, how did you manage to get Trump's endorsement?\" one of the women asked.\n\n\"I've been a registered Republican almost 30 years. For four years I registered as a Democrat. I took a chance on a newcomer named Obama and was disappointed,\" she explained, adding: \"President Trump knows a fighter when he sees one. He knows a winner when he sees one.\"\n\nAt that point she wrapped up her campaign pitch, and said goodbye with more hugs and effusive compliments - and one more shot across my bow. \"What do you think: are the BBC going to be fair?\" she asked the room.\n\nWe'd set up for our interview with her in another room of the house, and her press team insisted on filming us filming her. It was a little unnerving, but they said they wanted to make sure we didn't misrepresent her.\n\nInterviewing Lake is an exercise in frustration. First, she loves fighting with the press, and is uniquely well placed to do it.\n\nShe told reporters that if she becomes governor, she'll be their \"worst fricking nightmare\".\n\nSecond, she refuses to concede any doubt at all in her own election denial. During our interview, I put it to her that there was no evidence the 2020 election had been stolen. I pointed out that the Arizona Republican party's own recount had confirmed that Joe Biden had won the state. I reminded her that over 60 lawsuits claiming election fraud had been dismissed for lack of cause by judges around the US, including judges Trump himself had appointed.\n\nIt made no difference. She is far more disciplined and on message than Trump could ever be.\n\n\"We could sit here all day,\" she said. \"I can go over the evidence and the media still won't believe it because they're on a mission to discredit that.\"\n\nShe said evidence has never been presented, at least not in public. If the Lake team has it, we haven't seen it. She told me Arizona's attorney general has sat on a mountain of evidence. He says he's wrapped up his investigation and there's no evidence of fraud. The back-and-forth of baseless claims is frustrating. This should be black and white, fact-based, especially, one would think, to a news journalist.\n\nI went into my interview with Lake hoping to discover if she really believes what she says about the election being rigged, or if she just uses the conspiracy as a useful way to win votes. Honestly, I left none the wiser.\n\nAnd maybe it doesn't really matter. Lake is still casting doubt on the validity of elections, this time her own. And whether she believes it or not, millions of her supporters do. That's where the damage to American democracy can be done.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nThere may be opportunities for impromptu diplomacy at one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in years.\n\nThe US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Lake has built her political brand around her willingness to buck the D.C. establishment wing of the GOP.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lake met with about a dozen lobbyists in the nation's capital, and the following day she attended a campaign fundraiser that was heavy with D.C. hired guns.\n\nLake also met separately with a top GOP lobbyist recently to strategize how to get her in front of even more industry players, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Like others in this story, they were granted anonymity to describe private events.\n\nThe Arizona Senate race is poised to be one of the most competitive and high profile contests in the nation this fall. President Joe Biden won the state by a mere 10,000 votes in 2020, less than half a percent.\n\nArizona's late primary date -- July 30 -- means the Senate race will also likely be one of the most expensive in the country, as large fields of candidates on both sides spend the next five months raising money to duke it out for the nomination.\n\nLake's whirlwind D.C. schedule marks a significant departure from her message to voters in January. \"I don't give a damn what the lobbyists think,\" Lake wrote in a tweet on X.\n\n\"I don't care how much they vilify me in the media. I don't want a seat at the table with the political elites. I care about kitchen table issues,\" she wrote.\n\nNow, it appears a candidate who built her career around the idea of being an anti-establishment culture warrior is evolving into one who is ready to partner with the forces that wield real power on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the hours before her Wednesday fundraiser, Lake met with the most powerful Republican in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. As recently as August of last year, Lake tore into McConnell, questioning his health and his ability to lead the party.\n\nGuests at the Wednesday fundraiser included a lobbyist for tech giant Microsoft and another who works for the American Bankers Association, according to a source who was at the event. Other guests included over a dozen senators, according to an invitation obtained by CNBC.\n\nThe evening was a success, raising $330,000 for the Kari Lake Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that benefits her campaign, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a third Lake leadership PAC called Keep America Red Indefinitely, or KARI.\n\nPress representatives for Microsoft and the ABA did not reply to requests for comment on Lake's campaign from CNBC.\n\nLake also recently met with Rick Dearborn, a partner at the lobbying shop Mindset, according to sources familiar with the matter. The meeting focused on the types of future events Lake could host with attendees from a variety of business sectors.\n\nA former White House deputy chief of staff under Trump, Dearborn has a rolodex full of clients that could potentially be interested in meeting with Lake, including Shell, Amazon Web Services, Verizon and Meta, according to public lobbying disclosure reports.\n\nLake, who has already been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, previously ran a failed Arizona gubernatorial campaign in 2022. When she lost that race, she claimed that widespread election improprieties caused her defeat . She campaigned , in part, on the false idea that Trump's 2020 election defeat was the product of a rigged vote.\n\nIn a recent radio interview, Lake suggested that she still believes there are issues with elections.\n\nYet in conversations with lobbyists, the topic of the last election and election integrity issues has not come up, these sources explained.

      "text": "Kari Lake loses lawsuit over her defeat in Arizona governor's race\n\nA judge has thrown out Republican Kari Lake's challenge of her defeat in the Arizona governor's race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, rejecting her claim that problems with ballot printers at some polling places on Election Day were the result of intentional misconduct.\n\nIn a decision Saturday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson, who was appointed by then-Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, found that the court did not find clear and convincing evidence of the widespread misconduct that Lake had alleged had affected the result of the 2022 general election.\n\nThe judge said Lake's witnesses didn't have any personal knowledge of intentional misconduct.\n\n\"The Court cannot accept speculation or conjecture in place of clear and convincing evidence,\" Thompson said.\n\nLake, who lost to Hobbs by just over 17,000 votes, was among the most vocal 2022 Republicans promoting former President Donald Trump's election lies, which she made the centerpiece of her campaign. While most of the other election deniers around the country conceded after losing their races in November, Lake has not. Instead, she asked the judge to either declare her the winner or order a revote in Maricopa County.\n\nLawyers for Lake focused on problems with ballot printers at some polling places in Maricopa County, home to more than 60% of Arizona's voters. The defective printers produced ballots that were too light to be read by the on-site tabulators at polling places. Lines backed up in some areas amid the confusion.\n\nCounty officials say everyone had a chance to vote and all ballots were counted, since ballots affected by the printers were taken to more sophisticated counters at the elections department headquarters. They are in the process of investigating the root cause of the printer problems.\n\nLake's attorneys also claimed the chain of custody for ballots was broken at an off-site facility, where a contractor scans mail ballots to prepare them for processing. They claim workers at the facility put their own mail ballots into the pile, rather than sending their ballots through normal channels, and also that paperwork documenting the transfer of ballots was missing. The county disputes the claim.\n\nLake faced extremely long odds in her challenge, needing to prove not only that misconduct occurred, but also that it was intended to deny her victory and did in fact result in the wrong woman being declared the winner.\n\nHer attorneys pointed to a witness who examined ballots on behalf of her campaign and discovered 14 ballots that had 19-inch (48-centimeter) images of the ballot printed on 20-inch paper, meaning the ballots wouldn't be read by a tabulator. The witness insisted someone changed those printer configurations, a claim disputed by elections officials.\n\nCounty officials say the ballot images were slightly smaller as a result of a shrink-to-fit feature being selected on a printer by a tech employee who was looking for solutions to Election Day issues. They say about 1,200 ballots were affected by turning on the feature and that those ballots were duplicated so that they could be read by a tabulator. Ultimately, these ballots were counted, officials said.\n\nA person who takes public opinion polls testified on behalf of Lake, claiming technical problems at polling places had disenfranchised enough voters that it would have changed the outcome of the race in Lake's favor. But an expert who was called to testify by election officials said there was no evidence to back up the pollster's claim that 25,000 to 40,000 people who would normally have voted actually didn't cast ballots as a result of Election Day problems.\n\nThompson had previously dismissed eight of the 10 claims Lake raised in her lawsuit. Among those was Lake's allegation that Hobbs, in her capacity as secretary of state, and Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer engaged in censorship by flagging social media posts with election misinformation for possible removal by Twitter. He also dismissed her claims of discrimination against Republicans and that mail-in voting procedures are illegal.\n\nHobbs takes office as governor on Jan. 2.\n\nEarlier on Friday, another judge dismissed Republican Abraham Hamadeh's challenge of results in his race against Democrat Kris Mayes for Arizona attorney general. The court concluded that Hamadeh, who finished 511 votes behind Mayes and hasn't conceded the race, didn't prove the errors in vote counting that he had alleged.\n\nA court hearing is scheduled Thursday to present results of recounts in the races for attorney general, state superintendent and for a state legislative seat.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Lake, a prominent election denier and Trump ally, was allowed to go to trial last week with two of her 10 claims, which alleged misconduct with ballot printers and problems with ballot chain of custody.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson denied Lake's challenge after the trial in a 10-page ruling Saturday. He said the court did not find clear and convincing evidence of misconduct that would have changed the election results. Thompson also noted that the defendants had stated their intention to seek sanctions against Lake and ordered them to file a motion for sanctions by Monday morning.\n\nMore from NBC News: Kari Lake loses suit over her defeat in Arizona governor's race Migrants from Texas dropped off outside VP Harris' home on freezing Christmas Eve After string of abortion-rights wins, conservatives look to curtail the ballot measure process\n\nAttorneys for Hobbs, who has been Arizona's secretary of state for four years, joined the county in its filing Monday seeking $25,050 from Lake, which includes attorney fees for Hobbs and the state's most populous county. The county took aim at Lake's remarks before the election indicating she would not accept the results unless she won, as well as her \"groundless\" and \"frivolous\" lawsuit after the election was certified .\n\n\"Before a single vote was counted in the 2022 general election, Kari Lake publicly stated that she would accept the results of the gubernatorial election only if she were the winning candidate,\" the county said in the filing.\n\n\"But she has not simply failed to publicly acknowledge the election results. Instead, she filed a groundless, seventy-page election contest lawsuit against the Governor-Elect, the Secretary of State, and Maricopa County and several of its elected officials and employees (but no other county or its employees), thereby dragging them and this Court into this frivolous pursuit.\"\n\nThe county added that the courts \"should not be used to harass political opponents and sow completely unfounded doubts about the integrity of elections.\"\n\n\"Enough really is enough,\" the county said. \"It is past time to end unfounded attacks on elections and unwarranted accusations against elections officials.

We can't have someone who is corrupt and compromised running the Republican Party,\" Lake told NBC News on Tuesday, referring to state chair Jeff DeWit .\n\nDeWit did not respond to a request for comment but posted a letter on X saying he was resigning \"as Lake requested\" - while also claiming had threatened to release another incriminating tape if he didn't step down.\n\n\"This morning, I was determined to fight for my position. However, a few hours ago I received an ultimatum from Lake's team: resign or face the release of a new, more damaging recording,\" his statement said. \"I am truly unsure of its contents, but considering our numerous past open conversations as friends, I have decided not to take the risk. I am resigning as Lake requested,\" he added.\n\nA spokesperson for Lake did not immediately respond to a request for comment on DeWit's allegations. Lake posted on X that she'd be answering questions about the \"bribery scandal\" on the social media platform Rumble at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nIn the already released audio of the March 2023 conversation between DeWit and Lake posted online by Garret Lewis, a conservative talk show host in Arizona, the chair can be heard telling Lake, \"There are very powerful people that want to keep you out.\" \"They're wiling to put their money where their mouth is in a very big way,\" DeWit continued, calling it \"an incredible opportunity.\"\n\nThe \"they\" are never identified, other than as \"people back east.\" Lake said, \"This is crazy. They should want me. I'm a great candidate, people love me.\"\n\nThe conversation between Lake and DeWit, whom Lake had supported for chairman, came months after she lost the 20222 governor's race to Democrat Katie Hobbs. A 2020 presidential election denier , Lake maintained she had won the gubernatorial election and sued to overturn the results. The suit was dismissed in May of last year.\n\nDeWit is a former Arizona state treasurer who led Trump's Arizona campaign in 2016 and was chief operating officer of his 2020 campaign.\n\nIn the conversation with Lake, DeWit can be heard saying the unidentified people \"want you to stay out for two years. ... they want you to be on their team.\"\n\nLake tells him, \"I'm not going to let these people in DC tell me not to run.\"\n\nDeWit then asks, \"Is there a number at which...\" \"I could be bought?\" Lake asks. \"No.\"\n\nShe told DeWit, \"this is about getting Trump out. It's about getting DeSantis in,\" and \"I'm with Trump.\"\n\nDeWit pushed her to at least name a price.\n\n\"I actually just wish that you'd give me a counter-offer that was big.

Lake officially declared her campaign for Senate in October.\n\nIt's unclear why the audio was released now, but the Arizona GOP is holding its annual meeting in Phoenix on Saturday.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Steve Daines said he didn't know anything about the recording.\n\n\"Just saw the report on it,\" the Montana senator said, but \"I have not listened to it.\"\n\nAsked about DeWit's claim that people \"back east\" wanted her to stay out of the race, Daines said, \"Look, I think Kari Lake is a great candidate, and she's gonna win that race in Arizona.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The suit was dismissed in May of last year.\n\nDeWit is a former Arizona state treasurer who led Trump's Arizona campaign in 2016 and was chief operating officer of his 2020 campaign.\n\nIn the conversation with Lake, DeWit can be heard saying the unidentified people \"want you to stay out for two years. ... they want you to be on their team.\"\n\nLake tells him, \"I'm not going to let these people in DC tell me not to run.\"\n\nDeWit then asks, \"Is there a number at which...\" \"I could be bought?\" Lake asks. \"No.\"\n\nShe told DeWit, \"this is about getting Trump out. It's about getting DeSantis in,\" and \"I'm with Trump.\"\n\nDeWit pushed her to at least name a price.\n\n\"I actually just wish that you'd give me a counter-offer that was big. Give me a counter,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't be bought,\" she responded.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nNikki Haley refuses to quit, insisting she can still beat Trump\n\nOhio Senate overrides governor's veto of transgender care restriction\n\nConnecticut mayor wins the Democratic primary in a rare election redo\n\nIn his letter, DeWit said that Lake had released a \"selectively edited audio recording of our private conversation\" which she made while she was employed by DeWit's company. \"I genuinely believed I was offering a helpful perspective to someone I considered a friend,\" he wrote.\n\nDeWit said Lake had made it her \"mission to destroy me\" since a conversation where he recommended she end her campaign for the Senate to focus on another run for governor. Lake officially declared her campaign for Senate in October.\n\nIt's unclear why the audio was released now, but the Arizona GOP is holding its annual meeting in Phoenix on Saturday.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Steve Daines said he didn't know anything about the recording.\n\n\"Just saw the report on it,\" the Montana senator said, but \"I have not listened to it.\"\n\nAsked about DeWit's claim that people \"back east\" wanted her to stay out of the race, Daines said, \"Look, I think Kari Lake is a great candidate, and she's gonna win that race in Arizona.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

They've been going after his family,\" Ms. Lake told a standing-room audience during a campaign swing at The Trump Store in Show Low on May 31.\n\nOn May 30, a jury in Manhattan found Mr. Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents related to alleged payments he made to silence porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"Can you imagine [Mr. Trump's trial] happening in New York City right now with all of these illegals pouring into that city as a sanctuary city?\" Ms. Lake said.\n\n\"And what are they prosecuting? A bogus, made-up bookkeeping dispute. That's what they spent six weeks prosecuting. Not the murders. Not the rapes. Not the attacks on the subway. Who's losing out right now? It's We The People who are losing out.\"\n\nMs. Lake had two words to describe the jury verdict: \"Horrible. Unbelievable.\"\n\n\"Actually, I wish it were totally unbelievable. I actually kind of saw it coming with the direction we've been going,\" Ms. Lake said.\n\n\"His family's been dragged through the mud. I'm not here to defend him-I'm here because he's fighting for us. I don't want that happening to any of you. I guess I do defend him, because you know what? I've never seen a man who's more willing to fight for this country than President Trump.\"\n\nMs. Lake asked, \"Can you imagine, day after day after day-it's not just local news. It's worldwide news attacking him. People are waking up to it, and they're turning off the news.\n\n\"All they wanted to say was 'convicted felon.' They were willing to put our judicial system through all of this. They were willing to trample on our judicial system, our court system.\"\n\nMs. Lake is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate against Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nIn 2022, Ms. Lake ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor with President Trump's endorsement against former Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, despite Ms. Lake enjoying a 15-point lead in several polls.\n\nThe general election became mired in controversy following a massive failure of ballot counting machines and printers in multiple voter precincts and Ms. Lake's allegations of election fraud.\n\nMs. Lake accused the legacy media of working to undermine President Trump's 2024 presidential campaign throughout the six-week trial.\n\n\"They're going to ramp it up and see what sticks. You saw the headline-' Guilty. Convicted felon,'\" Ms. Lake said. \"That's what they're trying to get. They're trying to get us to [abandon] the one guy who has been fighting for us.\n\n\"They're going to say everything.\"\n\nArizona Sen. Wendy Rogers, a Republican, said she attended the rally in her district in Show Low to support Ms. Lake for U.S. Senate.\n\n\"This is the part of the country that loves Trump, loves Kari,\" said Ms. Rogers, who supports an election integrity bill pending in the state Senate, including a May 29 House Committee report recommending impeachment of Arizona Attorney General Kristen Mayes, a Democrat.\n\nThe 102-page report alleges that Ms. Mayes abused her power to attack her political opponents, used her position to advance a political agenda, and refused to uphold state laws.\n\nRegarding the jury verdict in Manhattan, Ms. Rogers believes the six-week trial was a \"sham\" and an example of \"weaponized government.\"\n\n\"I think more people are waking up. They know that President Trump stands in the breach for us, and they're coming for us,\" Ms. Rogers told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"This is what happens. They put targets over those of us who are strong and unflinching and stand up.\"\n\nThe senator said she does not see America's 45th president serving time in jail.\n\n\"I don't. But if he does, he can still be sworn in from jail. People think they have him cornered; his poll numbers go up. It's the darnedest thing. He will never give up.\"\n\nMs. Lake said the battle is not Democrat versus Republican, Left versus Right, but how \"we are going to push back against this monarchy-which is really globalism.\"\n\nShe said many Democrat voters realize the party has swung too far left and are ready to support President Trump.\n\n\"What you see has been replaced with communism. It's time to come on over,\" she said. \"People are ready to get back to our roots-our Bill of Rights-our freedom. This is about being American,\" said Ms. Lake.\n\n\"It's going to take all hands on deck to save this country. Everyone is suffering. Democrats are suffering. Independents are suffering. Let's start talking to our neighbors.\""

I actually kind of saw it coming with the direction we've been going,\" Ms. Lake said.\n\n\"His family's been dragged through the mud. I'm not here to defend him-I'm here because he's fighting for us. I don't want that happening to any of you. I guess I do defend him, because you know what? I've never seen a man who's more willing to fight for this country than President Trump.\"\n\nMs. Lake asked, \"Can you imagine, day after day after day-it's not just local news. It's worldwide news attacking him. People are waking up to it, and they're turning off the news.\n\n\"All they wanted to say was 'convicted felon.' They were willing to put our judicial system through all of this. They were willing to trample on our judicial system, our court system.\"\n\nMs. Lake is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate against Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nIn 2022, Ms. Lake ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor with President Trump's endorsement against former Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, despite Ms. Lake enjoying a 15-point lead in several polls.\n\nThe general election became mired in controversy following a massive failure of ballot counting machines and printers in multiple voter precincts and Ms. Lake's allegations of election fraud.\n\nMs. Lake accused the legacy media of working to undermine President Trump's 2024 presidential campaign throughout the six-week trial.\n\n\"They're going to ramp it up and see what sticks. You saw the headline-' Guilty. Convicted felon,'\" Ms. Lake said. \"That's what they're trying to get. They're trying to get us to [abandon] the one guy who has been fighting for us.\n\n\"They're going to say everything.\"\n\nArizona Sen. Wendy Rogers, a Republican, said she attended the rally in her district in Show Low to support Ms. Lake for U.S. Senate.\n\n\"This is the part of the country that loves Trump, loves Kari,\" said Ms. Rogers, who supports an election integrity bill pending in the state Senate, including a May 29 House Committee report recommending impeachment of Arizona Attorney General Kristen Mayes, a Democrat.\n\nThe 102-page report alleges that Ms. Mayes abused her power to attack her political opponents, used her position to advance a political agenda, and refused to uphold state laws.\n\nRegarding the jury verdict in Manhattan, Ms. Rogers believes the six-week trial was a \"sham\" and an example of \"weaponized government.\"\n\n\"I think more people are waking up. They know that President Trump stands in the breach for us, and they're coming for us,\" Ms. Rogers told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"This is what happens. They put targets over those of us who are strong and unflinching and stand up.\"\n\nThe senator said she does not see America's 45th president serving time in jail.\n\n\"I don't. But if he does, he can still be sworn in from jail. People think they have him cornered; his poll numbers go up. It's the darnedest thing. He will never give up.\"\n\nMs. Lake said the battle is not Democrat versus Republican, Left versus Right, but how \"we are going to push back against this monarchy-which is really globalism.\"\n\nShe said many Democrat voters realize the party has swung too far left and are ready to support President Trump.\n\n\"What you see has been replaced with communism. It's time to come on over,\" she said. \"People are ready to get back to our roots-our Bill of Rights-our freedom. This is about being American,\" said Ms. Lake.\n\n\"It's going to take all hands on deck to save this country. Everyone is suffering. Democrats are suffering. Independents are suffering. Let's start talking to our neighbors.\""

      "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.-It was supposed to be a \"red tsunami.\"\n\nNot just a wave. And not just the House. But the Senate, the governorships, and state legislatures. We were told it would be the end of the politics of race, gender fluidity, drag queen brunches, undocumented workers, homeless encampments, Dr. Fauci, ESG, RINOs-followed by the rebirth of America First: Donald Trump's announcement that he would run for president; his 2024 victory; and a nationwide, political realignment, which would be metabolic.\n\n\"The people are just starting to wake up,\" said Mark, a math teacher. (He called himself Citizen Mark, from Mesa. He didn't want to share his last name.) \"We, as Americans, have been asleep. We have been passive, and we're not really paying attention to what's happening, and Trump and the other patriots have been more astute, more aware, and they woke us up, and they have a game plan, I believe, and this is part of their game plan.\"\n\nWe were milling around outside the ballroom at the hotel where Kari Lake, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, was expected to give her victory speech. It was a little past 8 p.m., local time, and it seemed-at least, to Republicans-that the whole country, even New York, even Los Angeles, was waiting to be won.\n\nThat's not what happened.\n\nFirst, a couple of embattled, moderate Democrats won reelection in the House, starting with Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, then Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. Then, Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania-the better to rebuild the once-mighty blue wall. Then the networks called it for John Fetterman, the Democrat running against Dr. Oz for the Senate in Pennsylvania. Democratic Senator Maggie Hasson won a tough race in New Hampshire, and Democratic Senator Michael Bennet won in Colorado.\n\nAnd then, of course, it was too close to call the governor's race in Arizona-everyone had pretty much expected that Lake, the charismatic former television reporter, would defeat Democrat Katie Hobbs-and it was looking bad for Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel-funded, Trump-endorsed Republican running against Senator Mark Kelly. (As of this writing, Lake had gained some ground, and was down by a little less than 12,000 votes . Kelly maintained a nearly 90,000-vote edge over Masters.) Republicans are saying we won't have a final tally until Thursday or even Friday.\n\nThe Republicans at the GOP powwow in Scottsdale seemed mostly unfazed. They were, as one of the emcees put it, \"the party of positivity.\" The men in their blazers and khaki pants, with their string ties and goatees and drinks in hand; the ladies with their red dresses and flaxen manes and heels. Lots of leg, lots of cleavage.\n\nThey made jokes about Hunter Biden and Stacy Abrams-\"I'm so sick of being lectured to about all the black voters I've been supposedly repressing,\" one woman told me-and Beto O'Rourke, whom the emcee called a \"fake Mexican.\" When they called it for J.D. Vance in Ohio, the crowd exploded. There was a guy, probably in his twenties, impersonating Trump. He crushed it. Alice Cooper was on the hi-fi. Then Twisted Sister.\n\nIn retrospect, it wasn't that surprising-the red tsunami that didn't materialize. Yes, pretty much everyone had predicted Armageddon for Team Blue, and pretty much everyone was wrong.\n\nBut there was a logic to the fact that some Republicans who were meant to trounce barely eked it out, while others went down in flames.\n\nThat was because their politics seemed more like a feeling than an agenda that you could market and sell to other voters who might not normally vote Republican. Like the Contract with America, or the Great Society, or the Fair Deal or the New Deal.\n\nThe feeling had been building for many years, before Trump, before the Tea Party, all the way to the aughts or even the nineties, they said, when it seemed as if everything began to happen: the exporting of blue-collar jobs, the acrimony, automation, globalization. \"We've been angry since forever,\" a man in an American-flag tie told me, laughing. (\"And another thing,\" a man in a cowboy hat said, \"we were in high school or just out of high school then, and that's the time of your life you always look back on and wish you could go back to.\")\n\nAnyway, bottom line, they knew for sure what they did not want.\n\nThey didn't want a civil war. They didn't want teachers teaching that America is evil. They didn't want the Chinese Communist Party owning a majority stake in Hollywood. They didn't want their grandchildren on TikTok, and they didn't want TikTok selling their grandchildren's data.\n\nThey didn't care who you slept with, and they didn't care (that much) about whether you had an abortion or cut off your breasts and grew a penis (so long as you were over 18). They knew \"the libs\" thought they were white supremacists and Klansmen, and they no longer knew how to respond to that. They were done responding.\n\n\"It really breaks my heart when I'm considered a Nazi, because I'm a Republican. I mean, my father was a World War II Marine,\" Paula Glowacki told me. She had been born in the Chicago area, and she and her husband, Chris, had met at work-he was in IT; she stopped working ages ago to care for her parents-and then they moved to Arizona.\n\nThey had a harder time saying what they did want. What America 2032 might look like-an America in which the Republican Party had not only built durable majorities in the Congress and taken control of the White House, but won the war of ideas and enacted its agenda.\n\nThey had been in combat mode for so long, they had become so inured to the ad hominem attacks, the sloganeering, the warring, the pyrotechnics, that they hadn't given much thought to that.\n\nA better America, they said, would be energy-independent-more fracking, more nuclear. And it would secure its southern border.\n\nBut that was mostly it. The rest of their program was things like defending free expression and fostering a greater sense of community. It wasn't really a program as much as the Bill of Rights.\n\nChris Glowacki said that in this better, futuristic America, there would be a middle ground-room for hashing things out in a civilized way. \"You should be able to sit down and talk with each other, instead of saying, 'I don't agree with you, and I don't want to listen to you.' There's too much of that on both sides.\"\n\nRobby Starbuck, the music-video director-turned-Republican-congressional candidate in Tennessee, flew to Phoenix Tuesday afternoon to support Lake. When I asked him what kind of America Republicans pine for, he said it was one that embraced the old federalism-states' rights. If California wanted to give school children puberty blockers, that was California's business. Ditto with high taxes or low taxes or social services or whatever. What scared him was the emergence, over the past several years, of a Chinese-style social-credit system. He said that Covid, and the imposition of \"tyrannical\" anti-Covid policies, had been revealing. It reminded him of the Cuba his family had fled.\n\nIt was going on midnight, and most of Kari Lake's supporters had gone home or decamped to their hotel rooms, or they were clustered around one of the many makeshift bars, or they were smoking cigars. They didn't like being called MAGA. \"That's just a slogan,\" the man with the American-flag tie said. He was in construction east of Phoenix. (He worked with all kinds of \"illegals,\" he said-\"good people, Christians, salt of the Earth people, but they gotta follow the rules.\") He had a goatee and a wan smile. \"My point is I don't know what MAGA means,\" he continued. \"That doesn't actually say anything about the people you mean when you say, 'MAGA.'\"\n\nNor were all of them enthusiastic about Trump running again. \"MAGA is not the way it used to be,\" said Mary, a nurse. Her husband, Bruce, explained that Trump had been the bull in the china shop who had razed the old system, but they couldn't keep razing forever.\n\nMary remembered, when she was a girl, her parents, both lifelong Democrats, running the local caucus during the presidential caucuses in her home state of Iowa. This was in her house, in a little town north of Sioux City. That old-fashioned America seemed impossible now-like a memory of something that had never happened.\n\nThey were tired of watching the country fall apart. The fentanyl, the homelessness, the inflation, the rusting ports, the unreliable supply chains. The managed decline. And the elites presiding over that decline while insisting on everyone using the correct pronouns. And they believed they were the only ones who could stop America from spiraling into bloodshed and chaos, and if you said, But what about January 6? , they said, Well, that was a little excessive , or, more likely, What about it?\n\n\"I think it was a complete setup,\" said Mark, the math teacher, referring to the attack on the Capitol. \"I think Nancy Pelosi is behind the whole thing.\" If you tried to argue, if you said, Where's the evidence for that? , they offered up reams of circumstantial evidence-suggestive emails, articles from dubious sources.\n\nThey were not surprised that, even though Lake had been up in the polls for weeks, if not longer, the race was too close to call Election Night. They knew what that meant.\n\n\"They're doing whatever it takes to make the difference right now,\" Butch Meeks told me. He was referring to the ballot-counting machines in Maricopa County. There had been some irregularities, and Lake and Blake Masters, the Republican running against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, and the Republican National Committee were suing the county. Meeks went on: \"We used to always know in every state before morning who won. Now we're so much smarter, but we can't do what other countries can do? This is the United States. We have the best computers, but oh no, we can't count our ballots. That shows you it's just horrible-our country is against the people.\"\n\nMeeks' wife, Margie, added: \"The people who are running our country right now, I feel, want the United States to collapse.\"\n\nThe point was that the second coming was, for now, not coming. They could forget the Senate. The House was in sight, but by a sliver. The doddering, old man in the White House, who they had mocked, was stronger in the early morning of the day after than he had been just a few hours before. He hadn't run on much of a program either, but at least he was a reprieve, a break from the crazy, the vitriol.\n\nThe Arizonans I talked to, like the Trump wannabes-Lake, Masters, Bolduc, Mastriano -were still enraged, overflowing with contempt for \"the elites,\" \"the deep state,\" \"the administrative state,\" Washington, New York, the whole of California. It was the old rage that had been curdling since the dawn of web 1.0, since Ross Perot warned of that giant sucking sound, since the American hinterland had started to atrophy, and the old economic order disappeared. It wasn't an agenda. It wasn't a way forward.\n\nThe Red Wave should have occurred. Why it didn't is the $64,000 question! If someone revealed to me that the Communist Chinese-made voting computers had a backdoor enabling the Communist Chinese hacking of these voting machines, I just might think it possible!!  That makes more sense to me than otherwise!  The Red Wave should have occurred.\n\nSorry it's taken me weeks to read this piece. Perfect. Gee Gosh Golly...actual journalism! I don't know which \"side\" Mr. Savodnik is on! He observes, reports, perceives. Bravo. While I weep for my former profession, I'm grateful for Common Sense for pieces such as this.\n\nNo posts"

Sure, she realized the NYT, and, by extension, much of the MSM is partisan and corrupt. Admitting there's a problem is just the first step.\n\nHer views on Kellyanne Conway and Kari Lake are shallow left wing characterizations and she's a bit surprised it seems that they provided insights she found noteworthy.\n\nVivek gives an awesome answer on how one cannot blindly follow ideals but adapt to the situation at hand that goes right over her head. I don't think she is capable of parsing nuance in right wing views.\n\nThankfully, TFP has some writers I enjoy. I tip my cap to Bari for eschewing the corrupt MSM and starting TFP. However, moving forward I'll treat Bari's analysis of the GOP like she's George Costanza - whatever she says, I'll consider the opposite to be true.\n\nTFP, your coverage of this debate was unfortunate and was no different from other media organizations such as WPo and NYTimes.  While not a direct criticism of TFP, Andrew McCarthy's article in NR better expresses my thoughts of how Honestly irresponsibly reacted to this debate with condescension: https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/09/democrats-2024-plan-is-working-to-perfection/\n\nMore Moynihan! 🙌🏼\n\nLol did Trump have a fake autoworker union rally?\n\nSo Michael Moynihan is working for TFP now?

The 2022 midterm candidates he endorsed-Herschel Walker, Mehmet Oz, Kari Lake-all went down in flames. In 2023, he was declared guilty of sexually assaulting the writer E. Jean Carroll in a civil case. This past May, he was convicted in a Manhattan court on 34 felony counts for improperly reporting hush money payments. Overall, he has faced 116 indictments . Even now, the New York State attorney general is trying to punish the Trump Organization with nearly $500 million in fines, claiming that he unlawfully inflated the value of his properties.\n\nAnd yet here he is: America's 47th president.\n\nHow did he do it? Trump led an insurgency of oddball outsiders against an insular band of out-of-touch elites. Kamala Harris had Beyoncé, Harvard economists, The New York Times , and the cast of Saturday Night Live . Trump had Elon Musk, Robert Kennedy Jr., Joe Rogan, and the Teamster rank and file.

Mt 15:14.\n\nI didn't think the article was that condescending. I never thought there would be a red wave. I understood that the SCOTUS Roe decision would motivate women to stand by the Democrat Party and ignore the deceit their Party has peddled for decades now. Deceit that has led to overwhelming violence and chaos in our cities and Stalin like canceling and silencing within our workplaces and our schools. Deceit that supports our precious children being used as political pawns; telling our brown and black children that they're oppressed by their white peers and filling their precious souls with hopelessness and rage, while instructing our beautiful white children that they are oppressors and riddling them with shame, guilt, self doubt, and eventually, with their own rage. But I also recognized something that many Republicans refuse to acknowledge, which is that Trump must go in order for Republicans to sell their message(s). As a lifelong moderate independent Democrat I voted for the man once, knowing he was a jerk and a bully, because I thought that Republicans needed a fighter to bully back what has become the Party of Big Bullies, the Democrats. But we no longer need his brand of bullying, it's stale and regressive now. What we need is someone like DeSantis who Trump is now attempting to destroy with his ugly name calling and his narcissistic jealousies. I like DeSantis because he's Trump without the nastiness, without the delusions, without the ugly name calling and ugly lies; yes Trump lies, a lot; and did I mention that he's an absolute infant, and, most importantly from a political vantage, HE CAN'T WIN! My fear is that far too many Republicans are willing to bite off their noses to spite their faces and that they will continue to stay on this angry, mean, and dysfunctional  Trump ship as it burns and plunges to its and our inevitable doom. God bless All Americans!\n\nGonna neee to see that data on \"Immigrants with nothing to their name greatly outperform most black Americans.\"\n\nMaybe it's next to the data that \"America is the least racist country in the world.\"\n\nI thought I was on the page of Heather Cox Richardson\n\n\"State's rights\"\n\nGot it.\n\nNot complicated.\n\nUh...not a complicated concept.\n\n\"State's Rights\"\n\nGot it.\n\nApparently, you need to look up the fact that Graham is a major figure in the GOP and wins re-election quite easily. Not signs of unpopularity.\n\nThe law in Montana is abortion is legal until the fetus is viable, subject to certain conditions, such as parental notification in the case of a minor. Montana also bans partial birth abortions after a fetus has become viable.\n\nYou're quite confidently incorrect.\n\nLol....you think people are supporting abortion at 8-9 months?\n\nLol. Actually, not woke at all. Think diversity trainings are stupid and a waste of time.\n\nOh, wow the blacks are .\"lucky\"....had \"infinite head start\" ...have been \"lavished\".....now they're \"demonizing\"....\n\nYou're revealing yourself. By all means, keep going. And you call other people racist? Lol.\n\nUse quotations absoultely perfectly - especially when illustrating hypocrisy.\n\nBari has documented nothing. Fake, moral panic.\n\nHave lead you perfectly. Right to this point. Now, we'll see if the dumb horse drinks:\n\n1. What is \"wokeism\"\n\n2. How was wokeism effected your daily life?\n\n3.  What quantitative data do you have proving Americ is the \"least racist country in the world.\"\n\n4. Two camps/groups of Trump supporters.\n\nA. Non-racist (but racism/bigotry are not disqualifying)\n\nB. Racist.\n\nWhat do you think the percentages are?\n\nLook forward to your answer to the above 4 questions.\n\nGood to know sensibility prevailed, my faith in America restored.  Most Americans don't believe it's true because Trump says it and mocking, lying and being crude is not a way to win over people.\n\nLol....sorry, dude....still trying to get over you calling Birmingham \"dead weight\" for the state of AL.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo2idRoPeyM\n\nIn Arizona, the Secretary of State has her official employees counting the ballots. In the other provinces, the situation is not as questionable. And yes, I'm not seeing much in the way of campaign promises in Missouri, but for conservatives this is an unusually good country without the leftist misgovernment. That's the one promise the Republican party needed to emphasize.\n\n\"The Trump v. DeSantis talk by the Establishment isn't because one is good and one bad. They tried for 4yrs to split you from Trump & failed. Their new plan is to promote DeSantis in hopes you become suspicious, resulting in infighting, thus splitting the MAGA/America1st/Populist wing.\"\n\nhttps://fightthepower.substack.com/p/the-case-against-desantis-2024\n\nThis writer sounds a lot like my nephew who recently said to me, \"Republicans don't have a plan.\"\n\nHow about this:\n\nEnforce the laws and keep criminals in prison instead of on the streets.\n\nFund the police.\n\nEnforce the immigration laws and keep foreigners in other countries until their asylum applications are accepted.\n\nKeep voter registration lists accurate and up to date, and have a method of verifying that the people actually casting votes are on that list.\n\nStop the FBI from interfering with American elections.\n\nStop collusion between the government, Big Tech and Big Media to suppress the truth.\n\nRemove the regulatory barriers to producing energy in the United States. Stop trying to put a major American industry out of business.\n\nLet parents know what the schools are teaching their children.\n\nThe Bill of Rights? Yeah, remember that we have a Bill of Rights, that sounds like a pretty good plan to me."

      "text": "Early on Tuesday evening, The New York Times posted an item for its readers called Five Ways to Soothe Election Stress:\n\n(Yes, we checked, and it is indeed real.)\n\nIt urged anxious readers bracing for the widely predicted Republican romp to \"plunge your face into a bowl with ice water for 15-30 seconds.\" Or, if that didn't work, perhaps \"breathe like a baby.\" Or maybe \"try five finger breathing.\" (I googled that last one.)\n\nBut by Wednesday morning, conservatives and Republicans were the ones huddled under their weighted blankets downloading meditation apps.\n\nFor weeks, pundits and pollsters on the left and right had predicted a red wave, even a red tsunami. Some were predicting Republicans would gain 30 to 35 House seats. But that red wave turned out to be little more than a ripple.\n\nWhy?\n\nThink about the context as Americans headed to their polling places on Tuesday: A president, Joe Biden, with an approval rating of 41%. The worst crime wave in decades. The worst inflation in more than 40 years. Americans in poll after poll, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the country after a pandemic that crippled it.\n\nAnd still, while neither the House nor the Senate has been called, Republicans are expected to pick up a total of seven seats in the House, giving them far weaker control than polls predicted. The Senate looks likely to come down to a December runoff in Georgia. And governor's mansions across the country are occupied by about as many Democrats as Republicans.\n\nSo why did Republicans perform so badly?\n\nHere's one theory: Trump.\n\nTrump is poison. Trump lost in 2020 and on Tuesday night he helped lose at least 23 elections.\n\nThink of the candidates Trump endorsed:\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz. Oz was handpicked by Trump for the Pennsylvania Senate race over David McCormick, a West Point graduate who served in the Gulf War. It's not as if McCormick, a hedge funder, was anti-Trump; his wife, Dina Powell, was Trump's deputy national security adviser. But he did condemn the January 6 storming of the Capitol, so Trump endorsed Oz-who ran against John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor of the state who had a stroke in May and could barely make it through the single debate he agreed to. And still won.\n\nDoug Mastriano. The Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate was endorsed by Trump (and in league with the antisemites over at Gab). He lost his race for governor to the moderate Democrat Josh Shapiro by 13 percent and a whopping 600,000 votes.\n\nDon Bolduc. Bolduc-who claimed during the primary that Trump had won the 2020 election before later reversing his position-ran against incumbent Maggie Hassan for a New Hampshire Senate seat, but lost to Hassan 53 percent to 45 percent.\n\nJohn Gibbs. Trump denounced the incumbent in Michigan's 3rd congressional district, Peter Meijer , the only Republican freshman who voted to impeach him over January 6. Then, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee doubled down by funding John Gibbs, Meijer's MAGA challenger, who lost on Tuesday by 13 points to Hillary Scholten-who turned the seat Democratic for the first time in nearly 50 years.\n\nTudor Dixon , who ran for governor of Michigan, was endorsed by Trump and said his election was stolen. She lost on Tuesday night to Gretchen Whitmer, the incumbent who called women \"people with periods\" in a recent TikTok video and had been roundly criticized for her handling of Covid.\n\nThen there is Herschel Walker , who Trump endorsed, apparently unconcerned about Walker's history of domestic violence, child neglect, and the question of Walker's basic competence. (Walker's thoughts on the Green New Deal: \"So what we do is we're going to put, from the 'Green New Deal,' millions or billions of dollars cleaning our good air up. So all of a sudden China and India ain't putting nothing in there-cleaning that situation up. So all with that bad air, it's still there. But since we don't control the air, our good air decide to float over to China, bad air.\") The race was so close-a difference of just over 35,000 votes -that it's headed to a runoff.\n\nKari Lake was meant to be the new GOP star, and she sang right from Trump's hymnal on the 2020 election. Her gubernatorial race in Arizona is also too close to call, but she's 13,000 votes behind Katie Hobbs-the unpopular Democratic secretary of state, who refused to debate Lake-with 70 percent of ballots counted. (It's impossible to say with certainty who's going to win. But it's noteworthy that Maricopa County-by far, the biggest county in Arizona, which Trump lost by two points in 2020-has yet to be counted. What technology does Florida have that Arizona lacks?)\n\nThe other big race in Arizona was the Senate contest, in which astronaut Mark Kelly leads Trump-endorsed Blake Masters by nearly 100,000 votes. Masters was backed by Peter Thiel and received assistance from Trump's super PAC-at least $1.8 million-after Mitch McConnell's Leadership Fund cut spending in Arizona to divert resources elsewhere.\n\nNow, think about the candidates Trump trashed.\n\nBrian Kemp ended his race for the governorship 300,000 votes ahead of his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams despite the fact that Trump called Kemp, \"a complete and total disaster\" and  funneled millions to a Kemp primary challenger. Kemp had earned Trump's hatred by refusing Trump's entreaties to throw the 2020 election. So for good measure, the president insisted at a rally that Abrams would be a better governor.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Sununu , New Hampshire's incumbent Republican governor-who Trump couldn't stand -won by 16 points. At a Washington bash in April, Sununu said of Trump: \"He's fucking crazy!\"\n\nWho can argue?\n\nIt appears that one of the lessons of this cycle is telling your voters not to vote and that our elections are \"rigged\" won't help your party at the polls.\n\nIn the runup to the midterms, the former president, as always, prioritized himself, teasing the press with the idea that he was about to announce his own candidacy. He raised some $100 million for his SuperPAC in 2020 but spent, according to NBC , a measly $16 million on candidates. Trump spent election night-shocker-focusing on himself. He unleashed on his social media site, Truth Social, celebrating the defeat of Joe O'Dea, a Senate candidate who criticized him, among other jewels.\n\nBy Wednesday, he had moved on to negging Ron DeSantis -the only Republican who actually delivered the promised red wave, winning Florida by a massive 20 points, and who is currently dealing with a hurricane. (And is the biggest stumbling block separating Trump from the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.)\n\nHere's a second lesson: When abortion is on the ballot, it matters.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Dobbs decision in May, which repealed Roe v. Wade and rescinded national abortion rights, there were all kinds of predictions that abortion would drive this election-maybe even determine it. Then that narrative largely disappeared. Pollsters told us that abortion trailed voter concerns behind inflation, the economy, crime and immigration.\n\nTuesday proved that wrong. Exit polls showed that it ranked right up there with the economy for many voters. And abortion rights referendums-which were on the ballot in California, Kentucky, Vermont, and Michigan-won everywhere.\n\nIt's hardly surprising that progressive Vermont and California have codified abortion rights.\n\nIt's a little surprising that Michigan, which has wavered between Democratic and Republican control for years, has now enshrined abortion rights in its state constitution. But it's very surprising that Kentucky-not exactly a liberal redoubt-rejected a No Abortion amendment, which held there is no right to abortion in the state constitution, by a 5 percent margin. (A few months back, Kansas pulled a similar move.)\n\nWhen it comes to abortion, Americans tend to embrace the kind of compromise position that is the law in most European countries, where abortion is legal in the first trimester and outlawed after about 15 weeks. But if the choice is between being forced to carry a baby to term without exception-including cases of rape and incest, and cases in which the health of the mother is in danger or the baby is not expected to live for more than a few hours-voters will choose whatever else is on the ballot.\n\nThat doesn't mean the culture war is over. It is raging. And one man is winning it.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "We're sitting down to write this at 2 a.m., and by now it's clear: Donald Trump is set to be the 47th president of the United States, and on track to win the electoral college and the popular vote. It is a stunning comeback.\n\nThe red wave that wasn't in 2022 came crashing down tonight. Republicans have retaken control of the Senate. Control of Congress is still in the balance.\n\nGoing into tonight, Nate Silver ran 80,000 simulations of what could happen. In 40,012 of them, Kamala Harris won. Every pollster and pundit said the same: It was gonna be a squeaker. Too close to call. We wouldn't know for days, maybe even weeks!\n\nThat's not how it went down. Not at all.\n\nTrump had won Pennsylvania before the night was out. And by 2:30 in the morning, he was onstage, surrounded by his family and Dana White, delivering his victory speech in West Palm Beach.\n\nTonight at our election party, the British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore said he hadn't seen a comeback like this since Charles de Gaulle . But perhaps the only American echo of tonight is Richard Nixon. As Commentary editor John Podhoretz wrote on Twitter : \"This is the most staggering political comeback in American history. Period. Nixon has held the comeback trophy for nearly 60 years. No longer.\"\n\nWhy Trump won so convincingly-and why Kamala lost so fully-are themes we'll cover over the coming weeks. But for now, enough from us.\n\nSomehow, after livestreaming for six hours , we have a packed Front Page on this historic day beginning with our Eli Lake on How Trump Won.\n\nHere's Eli:\n\nDonald Trump ended his first term in disgrace, hit with a second impeachment after his supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The 2022 midterm candidates he endorsed-Herschel Walker, Mehmet Oz, Kari Lake-all went down in flames. In 2023, he was declared guilty of sexually assaulting the writer E. Jean Carroll in a civil case. This past May, he was convicted in a Manhattan court on 34 felony counts for improperly reporting hush money payments. Overall, he has faced 116 indictments . Even now, the New York State attorney general is trying to punish the Trump Organization with nearly $500 million in fines, claiming that he unlawfully inflated the value of his properties.\n\nAnd yet here he is: America's 47th president.\n\nHow did he do it?\n\nRead Eli Lake: \" How Trump Won .\"\n\n\"We Blew It, Joe\"\n\nThis race was the Democrats' to lose. And they blew it. Badly. As of 2 a.m., there wasn't a single state in the country in which Harris outperformed Joe Biden's 2020 numbers. What went wrong? Peter Savodnik has some ideas.\n\n\"They didn't lose because they didn't spend enough money,\" writes Peter. \"They didn't lose because they failed to trot out enough celebrity influencers. They lost because they were consumed by their own self-flattery, their own sense of self-importance.\"\n\nAnd above all else, they lost because they lied. \"They seemed to think that Americans wouldn't mind that they had pretended Joe Biden was 'sharp as a tack,' that they actually orchestrated a behind-the-scenes switcheroo, that the party that portrayed itself as the nation's answer to fascism nominated its standard-bearer without consulting a single voter.\"\n\nLast night, the truth caught up with them.\n\nRead Peter Savodnik: \" We Blew It, Joe! \"\n\nWe're Going to Be Okay\n\nDeep breath. In the run-up to last night, we heard a lot about how this was going to be the last American election-from both sides. Oprah Winfrey , speaking Monday evening at Kamala's last rally in Philadelphia, said: \"If we don't show up tomorrow, it is entirely possible that we will not have the opportunity to cast a ballot again.\" Elon Musk tweeted to his more than 200 million followers: \"Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election.\"\n\nWe call bullshit.\n\nAmerica is going to be okay.\n\nRead our editorial: \" Repeat After Us: This Is Not the Last Election .\"\n\nThe presidential race was only one of last night's shocking stories. Here are some of the others:\n\nAfter four years in the minority, Republicans have regained control of the Senate-as many expected ahead of the election. Their new majority was solidified as Republican Jim Justice won Joe Manchin's seat in West Virginia, political outsider and MAGA whisperer Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Ted Cruz won in his third competitive race for reelection, and Deb Fischer secured reelection in an unexpectedly close Nebraska race.\n\nThe battle for the House may not be settled for days, but it's possible the Republicans could cling to control, setting the stage for a unified GOP in Washington. Here's a smattering of the closest races that may hand the House to the Republicans: In Iowa, Rep. Zach Nunn held on to his seat in a race Democrats viewed as flippable; and in the increasingly red suburbs of NYC, New York Rep. Mike Lawler staved off a challenge from progressive Democrat Mondaire Jones.\n\nIn a scene reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's distraught voters in 2016, Harris's supporters left her increasingly dour election night watch party in tears as the candidate delayed her address until Wednesday afternoon. Biden did not attend the party, according to White House officials, in yet another indication of the distance placed between the incumbent and his vice president: \"Tonight, the president and First Lady will watch election results in the White House residence with longtime aides and senior White House staff.\"\n\nFlorida's abortion amendment failed, leaving the state's six-week ban in place. The current law, supported by Republican governor Ron DeSantis, has exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking, and the life of the mother. The amendment would have enshrined a right to an abortion any time before viability-roughly 24 weeks of pregnancy-and any time after when recommended by a healthcare provider. Abortion advocates outspent their opponents 8 to 1. But they needed 60 percent of the vote. In the end they got 57 percent, with 43 voting against. ( ICYMI: Read Olivia Reingold on \" How Abortion Became 'the Defund the Police of the GOP.' \" ) A separate amendment to legalize marijuana also failed in the Sunshine State.\n\nProp 36, California's tough-on-crime amendment, passed with overwhelming support . The ballot measure reverses Prop 47, a 2014 law that downgraded felonies like thefts of under $950 and drug violations to misdemeanors. Los Angeles district attorney George Gascón, a mastermind behind Prop 47, lost to law-and-order candidate Nathan Hochman.\n\nKentucky's school choice amendment failed, with 65 percent of voters casting their ballots against the measure. The amendment would have revised the state constitution to permit taxpayer money to go toward nonpublic education. (ICYMI: Read Frannie Block, \" School Choice Is Usually a Conservative Issue. Not in Kentucky .\")\n\nNew York passed Proposition 1 , ostensibly a bill to enshrine abortion rights, but really a Trojan horse allowing biological males into female spaces. (ICYMI: Read Josh Code for The Free Press on what this anti-equality measure means for the Big Apple .)\n\nMassachusetts failed to pass a ballot measure that would have legalized psychedelics, including psilocybin (mushrooms) and DMT. If the ballot measure had passed, the state would have joined Oregon and Colorado as the third state in the nation to legalize the recreational use of psychedelics.\n\nAnn Selzer ate her words after she hung her reputation on an especially optimistic Iowa poll this weekend that showed Harris leading the state by three points. She told The Daily Beast : \"I'll be reviewing data from multiple sources with hopes of learning why that happened. And, I welcome what that process might teach me.\"\n\nIf you missed our Free Press livestream-thanks to the hundreds of thousands of you who tuned in!-you can watch it here .

      "text": "On Wednesday night, Fox Business and Rumble hosted the second Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in beautiful Simi Valley, California. Bari Weiss and The Free Press 's very own Peter Savodnik watched live in the spin room as the seven candidates-Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, Chris Christie, Tim Scott, and Doug Burgum- took the stage to spar over questions about union strikes, inflation, income inequality, the cost of childcare, the border, China, crime, policing, drugs, gun violence, education, Russia, Ukraine. . . really, nothing new.\n\nBut of course, the man they really wanted to spar with and the man leading the polls by a landslide still refuses to play ball. So, we sent TFP reporter Michael Moynihan to check in on the elusive Donald Trump, who spent his night on the other side of the country speaking to a crowded room, which he claimed would be full of striking auto workers. (Though, Moynihan had a hard time finding them.) Trump's Detroit visit came just one day after President Biden went to the picket line in Wayne County to march with union members outside a General Motors plant-an unprecedented move by a sitting president.\n\nOn today's episode, as the two likely 2024 candidates battled to portray themselves as the voice of blue-collar Americans, what were the seven GOP hopefuls hoping to achieve by squabbling at the Reagan Library instead of marching with striking auto workers? Who were the biggest winners and losers of this very strange tale of two cities? And with nearly 60 percent of GOP voters backing Trump, is anyone emerging as a viable Trump competitor, or is it time to face the fact that we're tumbling toward a 2020 rematch between two very old men that no one really wants to see happen?\n\nMusic in this episode by blue dot sessions\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n\nBari's analysis of conservative thought and politicians is pathetic. Sure, she realized the NYT, and, by extension, much of the MSM is partisan and corrupt. Admitting there's a problem is just the first step.\n\nHer views on Kellyanne Conway and Kari Lake are shallow left wing characterizations and she's a bit surprised it seems that they provided insights she found noteworthy.\n\nVivek gives an awesome answer on how one cannot blindly follow ideals but adapt to the situation at hand that goes right over her head. I don't think she is capable of parsing nuance in right wing views.\n\nThankfully, TFP has some writers I enjoy. I tip my cap to Bari for eschewing the corrupt MSM and starting TFP. However, moving forward I'll treat Bari's analysis of the GOP like she's George Costanza - whatever she says, I'll consider the opposite to be true.\n\nTFP, your coverage of this debate was unfortunate and was no different from other media organizations such as WPo and NYTimes.  While not a direct criticism of TFP, Andrew McCarthy's article in NR better expresses my thoughts of how Honestly irresponsibly reacted to this debate with condescension: https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/09/democrats-2024-plan-is-working-to-perfection/\n\nNo posts"

A vote is a vote. But politicians don't care much about democracy anymore anyway these days. And that's the problem, because voters have stopped caring too now.\n\nVoters have had it. They are sick and tired of politicians who don't work for them, but for their own self-interest and their inflated egos and who spent most of their creativity on finding new ways to circumnavigate the will of the voters. They are sick and tired of a democracy that doesn't work for them but only for those who've got the cash to buy corrupt politicians and fancy lawyers.\n\nSo why not get rid of democracy altogether? Wait for it! It's about to happen...\n\nSoon You all gonna wake up in a completely different country, one with only the ruins of democratic institutions, one with no more checks and balances, one where justice is just another commodity traded on the markets place.\n\nBiden claims tomorrow will be a referendum over democracy. Trump claims tomorrow will be referendum over America.\n\nThese self-serving thugs are both liars. Tomorrow voters will decide which gang of jerks and thugs will own America and the copyrights to the pointless label that reads \"democracy\" for many years to come. The presidential election 2 years from now will already merely be a formality, a foregone conclusion. It will, like any other election in the future, be decided too, tomorrow. Not by voters, but by those who will get voted in tomorrow.\n\nFuture generations all over the world will hopefully learn from the demise of American democracy: Never take democracy for granted or You will loose it! And do not throw it out the window, because it was stolen from You, but fight for it! Because a functioning democracy is the only thing that stands between You and tyranny. Tyranny of the few over the many. Tyranny of money over the people. Tyranny of well meaners over well doers. Tyranny of the armed over the unarmed. Tyranny of the loud and shrill over the quit and reasonable. That's at least some positive take away from the midterms 2022 in the US. It can at least serve as an example for others not to make the same mistakes Americans have already made.\n\nSo many here are already complaining the elections are rigged and voting machines fixed and blahdey-blah. Question: If there is a red wave, will you continue to cry foul? Can't have it both ways, you guys--If red hats win, they did it through fraud, just as you claim upfront the blues will win.\n\nAnyone who pretends to know red wave, blue wave, or purple wave is lyiing. Nobody knows because social and political times are so chaotic now.\n\nHere in OH I'm stuck with a choice between Tim Ryan and JD Vance. God help me because I have to vote for Vance despite him clearly being an idiot. We need a red Senate so I'm doing my part. 🙏🏻\n\nI grew up in SE Ohio (don't live in OH now). I read Vance's memoir when it came out in 2016.  I know nothing about him other than what was in the book, I haven't seen any of his ads or watched debates but my opinion of him after reading the book was very positive.  I think his public persona is probably awful due to him not being a career politician. I'd recommend getting the book out of the library and just read the first chapter, see what you think. It was really good, I read it in like a day and half, couldn't put it down.\n\nI'll say it again, Bari Weiss: Oy veh, these are your readers! They have all seen the election fraud with their own eyes. And they don't mean Trump calling Raffensperger to find him votes. How does it feel, getting paid to write for these people? \"Slumming it\" can't begin to cover the horror.\n\n\"others who seem entirely unfit to serve\"  One would have to be blind, deaf and dumb to think Repugs have a monopoly on \"unfit to serve.\"  Biden and Fetterman are beyond reproach.\n\nBetter to put such propaganda at end of article so it seems a little objective.\n\nCommon Sense,\n\nOne question: do you consider this panel to be, on balance, politically neutral?\n\nI thank you in advance for your kind attention to this question.\n\nThis article is another example of why Bari Weiss/Common Sense is one of the very few organizations where one can get a non-politicized, measured and tempered assessment of current socio-political/cultural issues.\n\nI sure hope for a Republican win in PA for this issue alone:\n\n\"PA Democrats backed 'Trans Health Task Force' to facilitate child sex changes\n\nAmong those on the receiving end of \"Trans Health Workgroup Agenda and Materials\" was Rachel Levine, who was the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Health at the time.\"\n\nhttps://thepostmillennial.com/pa-democrats-backed-trans-health-task-force-to-facilitate-child-sex-changes?utm_campaign=64487\n\nOf course, \"Rachel\" is really Richard - now Assistant US Health Secretary and named First Female Four Star Admiral (?!?).  No one cares that he has long hair and wears a dress but he's a dude.  I think an intact dude.\n\nI'll say the same for AZ:\n\n\"Arizona Gov Candidate Katie Hobbs' Child-Therapist Husband Had 10-Year-Old Trans Patient, Lawsuit Says\"\n\nhttps://www.dailywire.com/news/arizona-gov-candidate-katie-hobbs-child-therapist-husband-had-10-year-old-trans-patient-lawsuit-says\n\nAnd, anyway, Kari Lake sounds great.\n\nI used to be an Independent - like Tulsi Gabbard is now.\n\nY'know what his whole argument is? People with cell phones in their pockets walked within two blocks past an election drop box. Holes big enough to drive a truck through.\n\nHanging chads is a \"process issue.\" Completely different than a candidate telling his cult, through an entire campaign, that the only way he'll lose is if it's stolen.\n\nYes...a candidate with a 41% approval rating lost an election...not possible.\n\nNote - you said we should be \"bracing for a red wave.\"  Why not WE SHOULD BE APPLAUDING A RED WAVE?  Showing bias aren't you???\n\nLol. Nope.\n\nSays nothing about the election being fraudulent/stolen. Just that if MAGA wins, democracy as we've come to know it is gone.\n\nNot the same thing. Nice try though.\n\n\"There's always a little fraud\"\n\nWinner, winner, chicken dinner!!!\n\nThe magic of the 2020 Elections.... Moral justifications for incivility. Not like that isn't a tired chess move many of us have seen before.\n\nHow many false moral justificatios where there in 2020 alone?\n\nThink of the deep rationales to justify: mass masking, school closures, information suppression, race rioting, wishing people ill, a \"little voter fraud.\"\n\nThe Dems/Left played it well with the sheer quantity of \"crises\" wore people down. Even many patriots types just waved the white flag. It was just an endless onslaught which manifested in a lack of a critical mass political will. We were in an, ahem, pandemic, after all.\n\nAlso, their strategy of large scale mail in balloting was amazing. Our legal systems aren't made to be nimble, especially for Constitutional matters. The Dems had a strategy of just proceeding with their well funded plan of making sure the low propensity voters' ballots were submitted, and making sure each of those ballots were counted.\n\nBallots and voters became one and the same. Intentionally conflated in a well constructed propaganda delivery system. The worn down, and tired population simply didn't care enough about Trump, Orange Hitler, to care.\n\nWell done. You own this Administration. Congratulations!\n\nMany, many people of both parties have challenged the results of elections over the years for various reasons and I do not recall them being branded liars and their challenge a \"lie\" as you insist on doing Ms Weiss. If we cannot rely on the election being run fairly and the results fairly tabulated then we have no country. I think you would agree with that and I would appreciate that you leave that word out of your rhetoric on this topic. I have two suggestions to start with- that there be election DAY (absentee ballots applied for as in days of old) and that the means of counting votes be standardized and that they be accounted for and results announced simultaneously by 12 on election night. This BS of swing (democrat) counties having the last say - it's like getting the last at bat and being able to automatically walk enough batters until you win - just bullshit and everyone knows it. You keep this little lie bit up and you will see many fewer renewals- play it straight."

      "text": "Time to dust off those pussy hats, folx.\n\nH.L. Mencken famously defined democracy as the \"theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\" For all the talk of Biden-Trump being the rematch no one wanted, turns out it's the rematch primary voters want-and the rest of us are going to get it, good and hard.\n\nLast night Donald Trump romped to an overwhelming victory. On the Democratic side, Biden won in fifteen of the sixteen states and territories up for grabs. (Shout-out to some guy called Jason Palmer, who clinched the Democratic American Samoa nomination.)\n\nMany challengers tried to save us from this fate. Trump's primary rivals tested a range of anti-Trump strategies. Ron DeSantis promised Trumpism without the drama-and discovered people want the drama. Chris Christie went all-out anti-Trump-and was booed for it. Mike Pence championed the Trump-Pence administration's track record-and put everyone to sleep. And Vivek Ramaswamy wasn't so much running against Trump as running to be his running mate.\n\nThat left Nikki Haley as the last woman standing. The Haley campaign became a rallying point for Republicans out of sync with the prevailing MAGA mood-but never showed signs of being anything more than that.\n\nSo: here we are. Trump, a 77-year-old man who says he'd like to be dictator for \"one day.\" And Joe Biden, who is 81, got the following ringing endorsement from Hillary Clinton yesterday: \"You know what, Joe Biden is old. Let's go ahead and accept the reality. Joe Biden is old.\"\n\nClinton framed the coming election as \"a contest between one candidate who's old but who's done an effective job and doesn't threaten our democracy\" and one \"who is old, barely makes sense when he talks, is dangerous, and threatens our democracy.\"\n\nWho's excited?\n\nWhy Nikki Haley's Supporters Stood by Her\n\nThe one woman left-no, not Marianne Williamson, though God bless her-as of closing time last night was Nikki Haley. A lot of people pinned a lot of hope on Haley. And they put their money behind her candidacy: the former South Carolina governor raised $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone.\n\nThough she's yet to officially drop out, the verdict is in: the Haley campaign didn't work. So why did many of her donors keep writing checks even after the writing was on the wall? The Free Press's Joe Nocera , who profiled Haley in New Hampshire back in January , made a few calls to find out.\n\nGoing into Super Tuesday, one thing was clear: Nikki Haley was going to lose most, if not all, of the 13 Republican primaries to Donald Trump.\n\nOf course, all the donors to the SFA Fund, the Nikki Haley super PAC, knew this as well. As her quest became ever-more quixotic, some big backers, like AFP Action, a Charles Koch vehicle, pulled their funding. But many others stuck with her; Haley raised an impressive $16.5 million just in January.\n\nSo why didn't they abandon her? Calling around on Tuesday, the answer I heard from a handful of donors was that she was reminding the country of what kind of person a Republican candidate ought to be. And that her campaign was so important for the country that they were happy to contribute even though, in political terms, it was a lost cause.\n\n\"I think she is illustrating what a Republican standard-bearer can and should be,\" said Jay Lefkowitz , a lawyer and former George W. Bush aide. He added, \"I think she should stay in the race, even after Super Tuesday. You never know. If Trump is forced to file for bankruptcy or convicted of a crime, or has serious health issues, that could change everything.\"\n\nMina Nguyen, a financial executive, described herself as \"proud\" to support Haley. \"Nikki provides a much-needed voice in this country, one that reflects my own as a daughter of refugees who believes in America's great values,\" she said in an email. \"I think it's important for America to see that there can be a candidate who represents hard work while remaining ethical, fierce advocacy without being a bully, and individual liberties without scandal.\"\n\nAnd Cliff Asness, the founder of the hedge fund AQR, put it very simply: \"Doing what you think is right is almost always worth it, succeed or fail, and this is no exception.\"\n\nHaley's merry band of disgruntled Republicans may be in the minority within their party, but they could yet play a decisive role come November, if they stay home and coalesce around a third-party candidate, or even vote for Biden.\n\nOne big question for Haley now: Will she endorse Trump?\n\nOur Other Super Tuesday Takeaways\n\nIt's the Trump Show-Even in California: In California, the battle to fill Diane Feinstein's old Senate seat will be a contest between a Democrat and a Republican. The deep-blue state's jungle primaries mean the top two candidates, regardless of party, go through to the general, and usually that means a choice between two Democrats. But not this time, because Republican and former L.A. Dodger Steve Garvey made it into the top two.\n\nGarvey will be up against Adam Schiff, the congressman who Republicans sought to expel from the House over Russiagate but who will now almost certainly become a senator. Schiff fought off his Democratic opponents by, well, not really fighting them at all, but instead posing as an anti-Trump crusader. And that, it seems, is what the voters wanted.\n\nAnd as for Stefan Simchowitz, the art-world upstart running in the race as a Republican and who we profiled on Monday-he did not come close to winning. As Simchowitz told Suzy : \"Sometimes if you know you're going to lose you can only win.\" That's the spirit, Stefan!\n\nCheerio, Deano! Time's up for Dean Phillips's quixotic presidential bid. I'm on the record as an admirer of the Minnesotan with moxie. But I'm starting to think he might not be the next president of the United States. Yes, Phillips did very badly last night. Back in November, Phillips said on X that if his \"campaign is not viable after March 5th, I'll wrap it up and endorse the likely nominee-Biden or otherwise.\" Time to honor your word, Dean.\n\nThe Death of the Centrist: Arizona independent Kyrsten Sinema announced yesterday that she wouldn't seek reelection. In every way, Sinema is a strange bird: a Democrat turned independent; an open bisexual in the Senate; a lawmaker who somehow finds the time to train for Ironman competitions; and a peacock among pigeons who dresses like an extra from The Hunger Games . We don't know about her fashion sense, but the rest of it-the independent-mindedness in an era of groupthink, her willingness to call it as she sees it-we admired. But in 2024 we can't have nice things. Here's how Sinema put it in a video announcing her decision not to run again: \"Compromise is a dirty word. We've arrived at that crossroad, and we chose anger and division. I believe in my approach, but it's not what America wants right now.\"\n\nHer departure puts the filibuster in jeopardy , and the race in Arizona is between MAGA die-hard Kari Lake, who bombed in the gubernatorial race in 2022, and Ruben Gallego, a progressive Democratic Congressman.\n\nIn bowing out, she follows two other moderates out the Senate chamber: Joe Manchin, a Blue Dog Democrat who has served West Virginia as a senator since 2010, and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, who, announcing his decision not to run, said of his fellow baby boomers: \"we're not the guys to be making the decisions\" about America's future. (The presidential candidates didn't get the memo.)\n\nWhat Will No Labels Do Next? The lesson of Romney, Manchin, and Sinema is an ugly one: Americans want the hard stuff. Bipartisanship is for wussies. This is the backdrop to all the umming and ahhing at No Labels over whether to field a presidential candidate. They don't have a candidate or, as far as we can tell, much of a plan. And this week they'll decide whether or not they will enter the race. Democratic operatives are desperate that they don't-fearing that a moderate alternative undermines the contrast Biden plans to draw between himself and Trump.\n\nFree Speech Under Threat Across the West\n\nImagine a world where you could go to jail for a \"hateful\" meme or a text message. That could soon be Ireland's reality. That country is seriously considering a sweeping law that would criminalize the act of \"inciting hatred\" against individuals or groups based on specified \"protected characteristics\" like race, nationality, religion, and sexual orientation. The definition of incitement is so broad as to include \"recklessly encouraging\" other people to hate or causing harm \"because of your views\" or opinions. In other words, intent doesn't matter. Nor would it matter if you actually posted the \"reckless\" content. Merely being in possession of that content could land you a fine of as much as €5,000 ($5,422) or up to 12 months in prison, or both.\n\nIt's not just Ireland. Canada has just announced extensive new hate speech legislation. And in Britain, existing laws mean that tweeting \"transwomen are men\" can lead to a knock on the door from the cops.\n\nThe Free Press 's Rupa Subramanya reports on the new hate speech laws that threaten the most basic freedom across the West. Those fighting censorship in Canada, or Britain, or Ireland, wish they had a First Amendment to fall back on.\n\nTen Stories We're Reading\n\nJoe Biden's State of the Union address, which he'll deliver Thursday evening, is seriously high stakes. ( Politico )\n\nDonald Trump has broken his silence on the Israel-Hamas war. \"Finish the problem,\" he said Wednesday of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. ( NBC )\n\nA far-left group called the Vulkan claimed responsibility for an arson attack that halted production at a Tesla plant in Germany. Because electric cars are the obvious target for ecoterrorism. ( The Guardian )\n\nRFK Jr. is considering seeking the Libertarian Party's nomination. \"He's a rogue punk rocker of the political system,\" said one source close to Kennedy. ( The Hill )\n\nAcross Washington, D.C.'s, high schools, 60 percent of students were chronically absent in the 2022-23 school year. ( D.C. Policy Center )\n\nThe FBI is hunting a suspected Iranian assassin accused of plotting to kill Mike Pompeo and other former U.S. officials. ( Semafor )\n\nGlobal climate policy isn't working. ( The Honest Broker )\n\nThe golden age of American Jewry is ending, writes Franklin Foer. ( The Atlantic )\n\nRich countries are addicted to cheap labor-and it's stopping them from investing in productivity-boosting technology. ( WSJ )\n\nWhen did novels stop mattering? ( The Intrinsic Perspective )\n\nAlso on our radar. . .\n\n→ Supreme sanity: On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado did not have the right to remove Donald Trump from the ballot. The decision was unanimous-because the law here is pretty clear (as Bill Barr argued in our pages back in January). In a sane world, everyone would recognize Colorado's move as a foolish scheme. It would be tossed out and that would be that.\n\nHere, in the reality-based community, that's exactly what happened. But it was a different story for the #Resistance die-hards.\n\nColumnists and cable news analysts with a few legal textbooks collecting dust on their shelves rushed to argue that all nine justices had it wrong.\n\nIn The New York Times , friend of The Free Press David French accused the court of \"erasing part of the constitution.\" ( Sorry David, we're with the justices on this one.)\n\nGeorge Conway (ex-husband to Kellyanne) said that he couldn't \"make heads or tails\" out of the court's reasoning-which says more about Conway than it does about the court.\n\nAnd then there's Keith Olbermann, patient zero of Trump Derangement Syndrome and someone who, honestly, it feels a little cruel to mention at this stage, talking about dissolving the court and. . . golden showers (?) on X.\n\n→ France, like most Americans, is moderate on abortion: France made history this week by becoming the first country to explicitly enshrine abortion rights in its constitution. A special session of lawmakers backed the amendment, which makes abortion a \"guaranteed freedom\" in French law. As most of the coverage has noted, the effort was galvanized by events this side of the Atlantic-in particular the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs .\n\nMillions of pro-choice Americans will likely read the headlines about France's new law with envy. But it's worth remembering that, with some exceptions, abortion is legal in France only in the first fourteen weeks of pregnancy. As The Washington Post notes , \"that's more restrictive than in nearly half of U.S. states, where abortion is protected well past fourteen weeks. This amendment won't in itself loosen any laws.\" For further context, Donald Trump is privately mulling a sixteen-week national abortion ban.\n\nSo the lesson from France is more complicated than it first seems. The French have a national consensus in favor of a right to abortion in the first fourteen weeks of pregnancy. Pro-choice campaigners who want to try to enshrine a national abortion rights law in the United States should take note and reckon with Americans' nuanced views on abortion that aren't properly captured by titles like \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, for more on how attitudes on this issue are shaping the right, read Olivia Reingold's latest: \" How Abortion Became 'the Defund the Police of the GOP.' \"\n\n→ Hot take: a nuclear Iran would be bad: You might have thought that, given all of Iran's troublemaking in the Middle East of late, now would be the time to take a stand against its march toward nuclear-power status. Apparently not.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency is meeting for its quarterly confab in Vienna this week, and Reuters reports that Western powers were considering proposing a resolution condemning Iran for its failure to cooperate with the organization but decided against it. The reason for backing down? Because the Biden administration wasn't on board. According to Reuters, Britain, France, and Germany were pushing for the move but \"Washington has opposed seeking a resolution against Iran for months, at least in part because of the impending U.S. presidential election in November, diplomats have said, and again it was the most reluctant of the four powers.\"\n\nI don't know, a nuclear Iran seems bad, guys, and not something we should choose to ignore because there's an election coming. Does that make me a warmongering neocon?\n\n→ TikTok KO: Remember banning TikTok? Whatever happened to that? It came up a while back, most lawmakers seemed to think it was bad for an app with ties to the Chinese Communist Party to be a whole generation's main source of news and entertainment, and then. . . we forgot to actually ban it. (Read: the lobbyists got to work.) Well, a bipartisan group of lawmakers have decided to cross it off their to-do list. The legislation, which was introduced in the House yesterday, would force ByteDance, the Chinese tech company that owns TikTok, to sell the platform in the next six months or face a ban. Announcing the bill, the lawmakers called TikTok \"an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security.\"\n\nThe White House came out in support of the legislation. \"We appreciate the work of Representatives Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi and we look forward to working with Congress to further strengthening this legislation to put it on the strongest possible legal footing,\" said a National Security Council spokesperson .\n\nMike Gallagher is the congressman leading the effort. Read his Free Press essay: \" Why Do Young Americans Support Hamas? Look at TikTok. \"\n\nAnd finally. . .\n\nWe couldn't go without mentioning America's big brother, Jason Kelce.\n\nIn January my colleagues Evan Gardner and Suzy Weiss debated who was the better Kelce brother: Travis, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs and is (for now) Mr. Taylor Swift, or his older brother, the all-pro Philadelphia Eagles center Jason. That debate is surely settled after Jason announced his retirement, after a brilliant thirteen-year career, in a forty-minute press conference in which he thanked everyone from his coaches to his high school band teacher to \"Thirsty Thursdays\" at a local bar-and riffed on the meaning of life and the importance of being a good dad. Watch his speech and try not to cry.\n\nOliver Wiseman is a writer and editor at The Free Press. Follow him on X @ollywiseman .\n\nAnd become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nJohn from 413, I am also a western Mass guy, love where I live but getting tougher all the time\n\n\"Americans want the hard stuff\".\n\nNo, partisans on the hard left and hard right want the hard stuff.  The remaining 2/3 of Americans want someone - almost anyone - else.  The two parties created a system that favors their base voters and activists, with an enormously expensive and difficult barrier to entry.  They even work to keep opponents to their favorites off the primary ballot.  Both parties are political fascists.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Republicans were feeling good this time two years ago, too.\n\nThe year was 2022. The Democrats' draconian Covid measures had never been worse, and the mood among Republicans was unmistakably bullish. This was the moment they had been waiting for: the big turn toward freedom and their chance to deliver a resounding mandate against two years of psychotic fear-mongering from hypochondriac Blues all across America.\n\nKari Lake was destined to be the next governor of Arizona and Herschel Walker was going to become the new senator from Georgia. Tudor Dixon was going to stage an unlikely defeat of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Blake Masters was going to beat Mark Kelly to inherit John McCain's Arizona senate seat, and Doug Mastriano was somehow going to sneak into the Pennsylvania governor's mansion.\n\nExcept none of it happened. The only MAGA Republican who carried that miserable night was the curious George Santos. The big GOP winners two years ago this November were the Trump critics Brian Kemp, Chris Sununu, and Ron DeSantis.\n\nLake, who made it her mission to \"drive a stake through the heart of the McCain machine,\" lost Arizona by razor-thin margins after she openly taunted the key McCain voting bloc with repeated attacks on the late senator. Eying a 2024 senate seat, she would later attempt to walk back her ferocious attacks, but the damage had been done. In the words of McCain's daughter Meghan: \"NO PEACE, BITCH.\" Masters championed many of the key tenets of Trumpism and paid for it dearly at the ballot box, where he lost by nearly 5 points to Kelly. The Washington Post labeled him the \"worst candidate\" of 2022.\n\nIn Georgia, Walker's candidacy was arguably more humiliating for Republicans. Not just because the fiercely pro-Trump candidate was convincingly beaten at the ballot box, but because it was revealed that the outspoken pro-life candidate allegedly pressured at least two women to get abortions in the past. It was the sort of hypocritical tale that has become all-too-common in the age of Trump. This year, Mark Robinson, a socially conservative firebrand and Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina, is embroiled in his own embarrassing porn site scandal that quieted the MAGA faithful. The whole charade could possibly drag down the Republican ticket and tilt North Carolina for Harris.\n\nDixon never had a chance to win Michigan, but you wouldn't have known it from the onslaught of \"They can't stop what's coming!\" posts scrawled on X (then Twitter) daily in the lead-up to Election Day. She was torched by 11.\n\nThe MAGA favorite Doug Mastriano, who made no effort to find common ground with independent voters, single-handedly sunk the Republican ticket in Pennsylvania, losing by 14 points and making things inescapably difficult for the Republican senatorial candidate, television's Dr. Oz, who was dogged by criticism that he just wasn't MAGA enough. Oz lost to John Fetterman, a more extreme candidate who had suffered brain damage from a stroke on the campaign trail, by less than 5 points.\n\nThe Red Wave had become a nightmare. It's worth remembering as we head into the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election cycle. The polls have never looked better for Trump. Republicans, for the first time since their walloping in 2022, are bullish again. Could the American electorate really rally behind Harris, a person who was hand-selected to lead the Democratic ticket by the same midwits running our government into the ground from behind the curtains on K and L street in Washington D.C.? If we take Trump at his word, maybe they can.\n\nSpeaking at the Detroit Economic Club on October 12, Trump gave perhaps the most honest assessment of the American electorate this century: \"The real threat to democracy is stupid people.\" Stupid politicians, stupid voters, stupid pollsters, and stupid pundits-it's a big whirlpool of stupidity, and we're all adrift in it.\n\nWhich isn't to say we should abandon democracy, but it's worth at least noting that until the votes are cast and counted, nothing is for certain. All the \"it's coming\" tweets (and I've seen far too many given the ghosts of two Novembers ago) won't carry Trump across the finish line. The voters will have to do that for him.\n\nSpencer Neale is the Features Editor at The American Conservative .

      "text": "Trump has assembled a Republican coalition that, if maintained, can usher in a period of generational strength.\n\nStories of historic comebacks are usually reserved for works of fiction; rarely in life, especially in politics, do we see a near-mythical resurrection. In living memory, only Richard Nixon managed such a feat at a national level, staging a political comeback in 1968, winning a 49-state landslide re-election, only to have his legacy lost to the Watergate scandal and his resignation.\n\nWhile Trump still has four more years to craft his legacy, hopefully avoiding a Nixonian obituary, the 47th and 37th presidents share a commonality: Their comebacks were each forged by a new Republican Party. In the same way that Nixon brought formerly Democratic Southerners, ethnic whites, Evangelicals, and neoconservatives into the Republican Party in 1968, Trump added young men, a multiracial working-class, and urban centers in the GOP's big tent.\n\nNixon's 1968 election gave Republicans a blueprint that delivered them the White House in five out of six elections from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. So what has Donald Trump's 2024 election offered? A governing majority, if they can keep it. Here's how he did it.\n\nDonald Trump is set to enter the White House for the second time with the highest favorability numbers he's ever had. The Emerson College poll found that 54 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the 45th and 47th president. The YouGov poll has his favorables at 50 percent, the first time he's been above unfavorables in his political career.\n\nIt may be difficult to remember in the afterglow of such a large election victory that Trump was at his most vulnerable position 20 months ago. In the aftermath of the 2022 midterm elections that saw disappointing results for Republicans and a series of Trump-backed candidates, including Kari Lake, Doug Mastriano, Tudor Dixon, and Herschel Walker, go down in defeat, a number of Republicans were ready to move on from The Donald and all the baggage he brought with him.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Trump found himself polling behind Ron DeSantis in New Hampshire and Florida, and he had just a small plurality in South Carolina, where former Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott managed to split enough votes to keep him in the lead. Nationally, polls found him leading with Republican voters by just single digits for the first time since 2016.\n\nAmericans overall, and a sizable population of Republicans, didn't want to renew the Trump show for a seventh season. According to the Quinnipiac poll from February 2023, Trump's favorability was -20 points nationally, he was losing a head-to-head matchup against Joe Biden, and about one-in-five Republicans had soured on him.\n\nTrump was not out, but definitely down. After losing the 2020 election, January 6, and losses in the midterms, he needed to regain his image as the ultimate winner, the boss from The Apprentice, the tycoon who would risk it all to Make America Great Again.\n\nHis numbers slowly began ticking up in the Republican primary as he warred with his GOP opponents; his army of social media influencers and television surrogates denounced DeSantis and Haley as being weak and too liberal. Yet it was Trump's vulnerability in the next few months that changed the state of the race permanently.\n\nIn late March, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's decision to indict Trump over payments made to Stormy Daniels through his lawyer galvanized his campaign in a way Democrats hadn't foreseen. The indictment which seemed so overtly political in nature caused a massive rally-around-the-king effect. The RealClearPolitics polling average showed Trump's overall lead in the GOP primary went from Trump +15 to Trump +30 in a matter of two weeks.\n\n\"If they can do that to him, they can do it to me,\" was a sentiment I heard from more than one voter. What voters were really saying was, they've done this to me and now they're doing this to him. Republicans had seen the double standards in law enforcement for some time. Why hadn't Hillary Clinton ever received the same treatment over the email server she destroyed or Joe Biden over the classified documents he kept in his house or any of the experts responsible for poor decisions that led to the Iraq War, the 2008 financial crisis, or the COVID-lockdowns that ruined countless lives? Trump being held to a different standard made him more relatable by people who felt the government was never on their side.\n\nMore charges followed in Georgia, Washington, D.C., and South Florida, all creating the same response from Republicans. For a population with deep distrust of Washington and politicians, there was no better endorsement of Trump than Alvin Bragg and Fanny Willis bringing these charges. Voters had a collective eye roll that the powers-that-be would do anything, say anything, and bring any charges possible to stop this man which made them trust him more.\n\nBy the time voting began in the primary, Trump had regained a commanding lead against both his primary opponents and Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to the New York Times /Siena poll from December 2023, Trump had the support of 63 percent of all Republicans, including three-quarters of white Republicans without a college degree. For the first time, Americans had a higher favorable opinion of him than Joe Biden. Trump's -12 favorability was substantially better than his successor's -18 approval rating.\n\nRather than believing the left's narrative that Trump was wildly corrupt, voters were overall split on whether the charges brought against him were political in nature, but Republicans were resolute that this was all done to stop him from running for president. More than 80 percent of GOP primary voters said it was a political hitjob, to just 14 percent who said the charges were serious.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for public figures with near universal name ID to change their public perception, oftentimes taking years of carefully constructed media appearances to slowly improve someone's image. Donald Trump managed to do it in a matter of months with the help of Democrats. He went from being an internet bully-in-chief to a martyr whose only crime in the eyes of his voters was standing up against the forces that be.\n\nHe had his base back and, by March 6, had won the nomination. The party was firmly his.\n\nWhen an assassin attempted to kill Trump on July 13, it only cemented the idea in voters' minds that Trump's detractors would do anything to stop him from becoming president. The fact that he survived because he happened to move his head just seconds before meant there was a divine providence protecting his life.\n\nAn old political trope is that a politician is never more popular than the day after they leave office. In a 2023 Gallup survey, every former president since 1960 with the exception of Bill Clinton is more popular than their last day in the White House.\n\nAnd it's true despite political partisanship. A majority of Democrats approve of the way Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush handled their job as president. Nearly 40 percent of Republicans say the same of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton did a good job as president. John Kennedy has the overall highest approval rating of 90 percent, despite being president for only 1,036 days and having a scandal-ridden White House that nearly launched the United States into a nuclear war.\n\nPeople look back at retired politicians and don't remember them so much as they remember themselves in that time or the picture that's been painted for them by the media and historians. A 60-year-old may look back at the Carter years and think less about the oil crisis and days of malaise and remember more their youth and the simplicity of the time, creating a fonder image of the president with that memory. It's like hearing someone say of their childhood, \"We were poor but we were happy.\"\n\nTrump's legacy enjoyed the same reflection from the rearview mirror, especially in comparison to his successor's handling of immigration, inflation, wages, crime, high interest rates, the wars in Ukraine and Israel and the retreat from Afghanistan. Americans collectively looked back on the Trump administration and remembered less turbulence across the globe, a robust economy, and controlled borders. Any memory of January 6 and COVID had been relegated to MSNBC's viewership and #Resist libs' social media.\n\nIt only helped Trump that the Biden administration and its media allies' response to any criticism from voters was that they inherited the problem from Trump, it was worse under Trump, or that voters shouldn't trust their feelings on the subject. Any voice dissenting from this narrative was considered blasphemous because they were helping a man they labeled as a threat against democracy.\n\nThe media's increasingly unhinged narratives about Trump became more difficult to justify at a time when voters struggled to put food on the table or buy a home. At the same time, they were insistent that the Biden's administration's inability to get a handle on the border and rampant illegal criminality was not happening, or that it was actually a good thing that it was happening. (Think of all the new Uber Eats drivers coming from south of the border!)\n\nIt also helped that Trump wasn't on social media outside Truth Social, where only his most loyal followers spent time. The media said Trump was unhinged, unwell, or in a mental decline, but voters saw none of it. This wasn't 2016, when his tweets were breaking news; people weren't inundated with the media's opinion of daily Trump's tweets and had anyway grown exhausted of how the media portrayed his \"scandals\" ranging from how many scoops of ice cream he ate to how chummy he was with foreign dictators. None of it mattered if they were struggling to buy eggs or felt unsafe in their community.\n\nBy April 2023, a CNN poll found that 55 percent of Americans viewed Trump's presidency as a success, up 14 points since he left the White House. On the other hand, Biden's presidency was thought of as a failure by over 60 percent of the country.\n\nA Marquette University poll in May found that voters trust Trump more than Biden on the economy, immigration and the border, Israel, and foreign policy.\n\nThe Donald Trump who lived in people's memory and the prosperity he brought during his first term was part of the person they were voting for, while the ailing and aging Joe Biden and the media that lied to defend him was who they were voting against.\n\n\"He is far beyond cogent, in fact I think he's better than he's ever been,\" MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said on March 6 about Joe Biden when questions of his mental fitness came up in the media. \"I'm about to tell you the truth, and 'f' you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically is the best Biden ever. Not a close second.\"\n\nAbout 10 weeks later, a bewildered-looking Biden stood before the entire country during the presidential debate and announced, \"We finally beat Medicare.\" These are probably the most consequential four words ever uttered during a presidential debate.\n\nFor millions of Americans, it was an indictment of the media as much as it was of Biden himself. The public knew what was so obvious for so long: There was something wrong with our president, and everyone from the vice president to the media had lied to the country about it. Everyone who had publicly questioned the White House narrative was called a conspiracy theorist or a right-wing stooge helping Trump. Those four words permanently sowed a level of distrust in the media's narrative about this election that could never be undone.\n\nWithin weeks, the whole house of cards came crumbling down. Trump was beating Biden by 5 to 6 points in the national popular vote according to polls from CBS News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and CNN. This election was on course to be a rout. Private polling had Trump winning Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico, Maine, New Hampshire, and even New Jersey. Knowing how close the election actually was against Harris, it's not inconceivable that Trump would have won all those states and put places like New York and Illinois into play.\n\nFor the first time ever, a Democrat knew what it felt like to be a Republican as the entire media, donor class, and political establishment pressed Joe Biden with wall-to-wall negative coverage and pressure to drop out of the race.\n\nBiden did, Harris became the nominee, and overnight the woman who for four years had been compared to the bumbling, narcissistic Vice President Selina Meyer on the show Veep was being sold as the ultimate girl boss.\n\nDonald Trump has been famous longer than the average American has been alive. For decades he was one of the most famous men in America and someone celebrities wanted to be photographed with until he descended on the golden escalator in 2016. Yet for the last decade, to be associated with Trump was to be considered a social pariah. You could be \"cancelled\" for wearing a MAGA hat or relegated to D-list celebrity status. That all changed during this election.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint an exact moment, but there were a few signs, as when rapper 50 Cent posted a picture of Trump's face on his hit album cover, Trump's series of appearances at UFC fights with Dana White, the YouTube influencer and boxer Jake Paul's endorsement, Joe Rogan's interview, or the TikTok dances.\n\nFor the first time, it was socially acceptable and even cool to be a Trump supporter.\n\nNow, obviously Trump didn't have the A-list celebrity endorsements that Harris had; there was no Beyonce, Taylor Swift, or Oprah Winfrey to join him at a rally. He didn't need them, though. He needed Americans who were on the fence and needed it to be okay to support Trump, especially women and minorities. So when the model Amber Rose spoke at the RNC, the rapper Kodak Black lent Trump his endorsement, or the wife of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes came out supporting Trump on Instagram, it didn't influence voters minds but just made it less fringe to support him either publicly or privately.\n\nThe UFC and podcasting played a major part in this evolution of the Trump brand. Trump entering UFC fights became a type of event in and of itself, as celebrities like Joe Burrow and Nick Bosa took selfies with him. Who sat next to Trump became an area of interest, as well as noting which fighters saluted him before or after the match. The stigma of being seen with this man was gone.\n\nPodcasting added another layer to Trump's appeal with young voters, especially young men. Want to hear Trump talk about UFOs, the assassination attempt, his favorite insults for political opponents, cocaine, football, Jeffrey Epstein, reviving the economy, and which celebrities he knew? Well, there was a podcast appearance about that. Trump spoke to any of these major podcasters about basically anything they're interested in for hours at a time.\n\nThis was an important strategy not only for reaching out to the young college-aged male but also the young minority male vote. Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Andrew Schultz, Barstool Sports, and the rest have massive audiences of minority men, and this is supplemented for traditional campaign coalition teams. You don't have to do \"[insert ethnicity] for Trump\" when you're reaching out to a cross-section of podcast listeners.\n\nA senior member of Team Trump said that the campaign benefited from having people of diverse ages on the campaign who could advocate for which podcasts to appear on and think outside of the box.\n\nBeing affiliated with Trump was just no longer radioactive. Podcastsers, social media influencers, and the UFC made Trump more relatable-while Oprah, Taylor Swift, and Beyonce made Harris more distant.\n\nLabeling J.D. Vance \"weird\" always seemed, well, weird to me. Perhaps because I've known him for a few years and worked on a Super PAC supporting his 2022 Senate election, I knew he was as normal as anyone could be given his intelligence and incredible success. How many people serve in the military, become a best-selling author, literary celebrity, venture capitalist, senator, and vice presidential candidate by the time they're 40? That is weird, I suppose.\n\nDemocrats worked overtime to paint him as the worst possible pick for vice president. Minnesota's Gov. Tim Walz took pleasure in calling him \"weird,\" a phrase that was repeated on the campaign stump and on social media countless times.\n\nVance was largely left out to dry during his initial rollout. He certainly had many detractors within the GOP who didn't want him on the ticket. This came from both figures at the center of the party, who felt he was too unorthodox and wanted someone that more closely resembled Mike Pence, and those on the more conservative side who wanted an older pick, someone who couldn't be a natural successor to Trump and would retire in 2028 when he did. The negative onslaught against Vance, who had already spent nearly a decade since the release of Hillbilly Elegy in the media spotlight, reached a fever pitch once Trump announced him.\n\nTo his credit, Vance didn't shy away from tough interviews; he met the challenge, sometimes appearing on three or four Sunday shows. He was taking on more combative interviews on any given weekend than Harris and Walz did during the entire campaign.\n\nWalz's inexperience doing interviews-especially in comparison to Vance, who did nearly one a day-proved a serious weakness in the vice-presidential debate. The two standing side-by-side lent itself to comparisons of the Nixon-Kennedy debates in 1960. Walz looked sweaty, stuttering, and incredibly nervous, like Fred Mertz during a scene from I Love Lucy ; Vance was calm, collected, and threw TV-canny side-eyes at the moderators and his political adversary.\n\nThe debate was remarkably substantive, hearkening back to a different time in politics, one that the general public missed. Vance breathed a new level of intelligence to Trumpism-less flashy, more relatable, while being able to note the complexity of public policy.\n\nHis post-debate appearances also focused on the podcast circuit more, with comedians like Theo Von, Tim Dillon, and Joe Rogan. While they received less media attention than Trump's, they destroyed any notion that he was weird. The majority of the top comments on the Theo Von podcast all had the same take, \"This guy is supposed to be weird? He's the most normal, down-to-earth guy.\"\n\nWhen the New York Times interviewed 13 young voters, three, two of whom were women, said they cast their ballots for Trump because Vance was on the ticket.\n\n\"I can't believe it, but I did end up voting for Donald Trump. I made that decision when I saw J.D. Vance's interview with the New York Times . He is the future of the Republican Party. I'm more voting for Vance than I am for Trump,\" said Abigail, a 23-year-old graduate assistant who voted for Biden in 2020.\n\n\"I shocked myself and voted for Trump. No one tell my family. I was so impressed by JD Vance, the way he carried himself and how normal he appeared,\" said McLane, a 25-year-old resident of Washington D.C. who wrote in Mitt Romney's name in 2020.\n\nPerhaps Vance's family life, as a doting husband to a very successful lawyer and active father, helped appeal with young women who were on the fence and weren't seeing the misogynist who defamed \"cat ladies\" that the media were talking about.\n\nDespite promoting an image of a girlboss running a flawless campaign based on joy, Harris was always in trouble. To the public, the difference between her and Joe Biden was skin-deep; she could never fully explain how she would chart her own path for the country. Her campaign strategy seemed to be dodging interviews, palling around with celebrities, and laughing like a hyena in front of the cameras.\n\nAlmost every media narrative on her campaign was based on \"vibes,\" not facts. Reporters and television pundits proudly proclaimed that this election was going to show the biggest gender divide in American political history, but polls never showed that. Among aggregated public polls, Kamala was never doing better among women than Biden or Hillary Clinton. There were countless comparisons to Barack Obama, but they were never sincere. Whether you hate or love Obama, his defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary was meteoric, and the campaign had a genuine groundswell of support that defined the era.\n\nDuring a series of softball interviews, Harris wasn't able to answer the most basic question of how she differed with Biden on voters' top issues, particularly immigration and the economy. It became a running joke how often she would say, \"I grew up in a middle-class family.\"\n\nThis was most evident on The View , where the most openly racist person on television, Sunny Hostin, asked Harris whether she would have done anything different than Biden.\n\n\"There is not a thing that comes to mind,\" Harris responded. \"And I've been part of most of the decisions that have had impact.\"\n\nAt a time when governing political parties across the globe were losing elections, this answer isn't going to cut it.\n\nAlso hurting Harris were the radical positions she took in 2020 during the \"Great Awokening,\" when she championed Black Lives Matter activists' calls to defund the police, open-border activists' calls for amnesty and destroying ICE, and trans activists' demands for taxpayer-funded sex-change surgeries. She allowed herself to make decisions based upon the whims of the most mentally ill leftists on Twitter and in Democratic think tanks, which proved to be nightmarish when she became the party's nominee.\n\nTrump's closing ad-\"he's for you and she's for 'they/them,'\" in which he discussed Harris's support for taxpayer funded transgeneder surgeries for illegal aliens-was especially brilliant because it played to two of her weakest points. Post-election, many politicians, including on the left, focused on how she was too supportive of the trans movement but her inability to come out for real enforcement on illegal immigration was also a big part of it.\n\nIn the postmortem of her election, Democratic strategists are finger pointing at Biden, Merrick Garland for not indicting Trump, and voters for refusing to see what they saw.\n\nUltimately, however, the party was suffering from a bad economy that it refused even to acknowledge and from candidates who were too far to the left for the country. They believed that Harris's identity as a woman of color who supported abortion and \"democracy\" would be enough to win over voters when it ended up pushing them away.\n\nAsking who is to blame for Harris's failure to secure 270 electoral votes, Democrats need to only look in the mirror and reflect on the utter madness they have espoused over the last four years. \"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\"\n\nDonald Trump's victory defied all expectations: he won every swing state, the popular vote, and put states like New Jersey, Minnesota, and New Hampshire into play. His last term in office will begin much like his first term, with a Republican majority in the Senate and a small one in the House. But as divided as the party seemed when he first put his hand on the Bible and gave his \"American carnage\" speech, it is now more united than it has been in decades. Today, it is the MAGA party; Trump built it on his sheer ability to connect with people and defy decades of political orthodoxy that no longer served the public.\n\nTrump is a unique politician; we'll never see someone like him again. The coalition he built was equally as special. According to AP VoteCast, Trump's path to victory brought together a majority of Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers, 47 percent of millennials, who made up the base of Obama's coalition, and a shocking 47 percent of Gen-Zers, who get their news on TikTok, X, and Instagram.\n\nThe base of his party is the working-class white men and women, especially ethnic whites, who delivered Appalachia, the South, and the Rust Belt; one in four black men, who helped him win in Georgia and North Carolina; and nearly half of all Hispanic and Asian men, who made a big difference in the Southwest and counties in big blue states like Nassau, New York; Passaic, New Jersey; Riverside, California; and precincts across Massachusetts, Illinois, and Virginia.\n\nThere's also the women's vote, which Trump only lost by single digits-the most narrow of all three of his elections.\n\nSo why did this coalition come together for him?\n\nIn part, because voters had become exhausted by the narrative that he was an existential threat to the nation. Liberal hyperbole about Trump's tenure was unfounded to the lived experience of his first term. We never got the world war they promised. That's the problem with the man chanting \"the end is near\"; eventually it has to come. For the Trump panickers, it never did.\n\nSecond, was the dishonesty of the media in refusing to acknowledge basic truths most Americans felt. The economy isn't in great shape, illegal alien gangs were operating in cities and municipalities where they'd never before been present, and crime had increased in large parts of the country. Their refusal to acknowledge what people were going through made this election in part a referendum on the media which so heavily was tipping the scales for Kamala after spending three years lying about Joe Biden's health.\n\nIdeologically, Trump also ran as a moderate, but not in the sense most politicos understand it. When the average person thinks of a moderate, they may immediately think of someone like Susan Collins or Joe Manchin, when in fact moderates hold far-left and far-right positions on various issues that make them seem moderate when you average them out.\n\nA University of California, Berkeley study from 2014 found that the average moderate voters tended to hold left-wing positions on Social Security, Medicare, and marijuana while having right-wing positions on immigration, the environment, and unions. That's basically where Trump's rhetoric lay, along with other conservative positions on Israel, crime, and taxes. While Harris's team insisted that she had backed away from more radical positions from her past, she never backed away from them publicly. In fact, when she was asked how she voted on a California amendment to raise the punishments for certain drug and theft crimes, she wouldn't state her position. She felt that her answer could be too divisive, splintering her far-left base. The amendment passed with nearly 69 percent of the vote.\n\nThat essentially tells the story of the modern Democratic Party, ignoring the overwhelming majority to chase the most fringe segments of their base on issues like crime, immigration, and the economy. According to the Fox News exit survey , voters trust Trump more than Harris on all those issues.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, was able to moderate on issues like abortion, chasing moderate voters and correctly believing that the overwhelming majority of pro-life voters wouldn't abandon him. So when 63 percent of Americans said in exit polls that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, Trump won a third of their vote, while holding on to 83 percent of pro-lifers.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that the Fox News survey showed that 52 percent of respondents believed Donald Trump had the right policy ideas for the country compared, to 47 percent for Kamala Harris.\n\nPart of this majority coalition is unique to Trump, certainly many minority voters who cast a ballot for a Republican for the first time backed Democrats running in the House and Senate. Yet that doesn't have to be forever. Just as Nixon created the coalition that put Republicans in the White House in five out of six presidential elections, Trump may have created such a winning coalition for the long term.\n\nTrump was these voters' first foray into voting Republican, but as so long as the party is able to a more working-class party and more trusted on the issues of crime, immigration, and the economy, and as long as Democrats continue to surrender to the most radical segments of their base, they'll have a path to the majority.\n\nAs we close the book on Trump being a candidate for office, it's worth reconsidering the words of Abraham Lincoln: \"The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise-with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\"\n\nDonald Trump disentangled the Republican Party from the dogmas of neoconservatism, moving past the bygone days of Reagan and Bush and reaching out to voters who were always within reach but never felt a political party spoke to them. Some say he conducted a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, but in fact all he did was see a million-dollar bill on the ground and pick it up. Democrats and the corporate media cannot help but push against him-they have too much at stake in the current political system-but if the GOP can continue to build itself up as a working-class party that advocates for the forgotten man, it will keep Trump's governing majority.\n\nThis article appears in the January/February 2025 issue\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Tuesday night's results solidified the importance of the culture war.\n\nLast night wasn't the red wave Republicans began to envision in the last three weeks of the 2022 midterm election cycle. Only after hundreds of thousands of votes were already cast in crucial states like Pennsylvania and Georgia did the Senate ever start to feel like a sure thing in GOP observers' minds. In reality, it was always going to be a nail-biter, and it was always going to take days-if not a month because of a potential Georgia runoff-to sort out. The House felt well in Republican hands, but dreams of a twenty-plus Republican majority were just that.\n\nYet, despite a disappointing night for Republicans and their high hopes, it might still be \"mission accomplished.\" The House will return to Republican control by a slim margin-the New York Times currently estimates that the GOP will hold 224 seats, mirroring the FiveThirtyEight estimate from mid-October before polls started breaking more towards the GOP. The Senate is far from a sure thing, but Republican Adam Laxalt currently has a lead in Nevada, and word on the street is that there might be enough votes left in Arizona to pull both GOP Senate candidate Blake Masters and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake over the line. And who knows what could happen in a Georgia runoff, though I wouldn't put money on Walker if control of the Senate comes down to Dec. 6 in the Peach State. Considering the 2022 midterms, a limited GOP success is still possible, if increasingly unlikely.\n\nWednesday morning left the nation with more questions than answers. Why is every state, other than Florida, remarkably poor at tabulating election results? Do October surprises or late-poll-surges even matter in the era of forever-Covid mail-in ballot elections? Who deserves credit for the Democrats' overperformance, and who is to blame for Republican underperformance? Should Kevin McCarthy be allowed to hold the Speaker's gavel? And if it was the fault of Dobbs rather than Republican politicians, isn't a narrow House majority, and a tied Senate with West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin among the Democratic ranks, a small price to pay for the fall of Roe ?\n\nOne thing thus far is abundantly clear: to win tossups and swing elections, conservatives must advisedly swing to the right, not tack to the center.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision was leaked and then later handed down, Democrats engaged fiercely in the culture war. January 6 and the Select Committee to investigate it, continuing its work through the summer and early fall, provided an essential backdrop. For Democrats, the election became more about alleged Republican extremism than anything else. But isn't that always part of the Democrat's electoral strategy? To call Republicans fascists, bigots, misogynists, and all the other dirty words in the liberal mind? Of course it is, and Republicans should learn from them.\n\nBut this cycle was different. Unlike 2016, 2018, and 2020, Democrats were in complete control of government. And things were far from going their way-skyrocketing inflation, crime, illegal immigration, drug overdoses, homelessness, the list goes on. But instead of having to defend their record of governance or their policy proposals to fix these abundant problems, Democrats wisely chose to lean into the culture war. They said democracy was on the ballot, Jim Crow was on the ballot, America's soul was on the ballot. LGBT and women's healthcare and even rights were on the ballot, too.\n\nThe Republican candidates who refused to allow the left to set the terms of the culture war, and fought back both with rhetoric and substance, won, and won handily, last night.\n\nNowhere was that victory more pronounced than in Florida. Incumbent Republican Governor Ron DeSantis defeated challenger Charlie Crist by 20 points. Every single county in Florida shifted in Republicans' favor-and by massive margins. Democrats' only hope for Florida before Tuesday night was stellar results in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Broward shifted 14 points towards DeSantis, and the governor actually won Miami-Dade outright as it shifted 19 points in the incumbent governor's favor compared to the 2020 election. Republican Senator Marco Rubio also won Miami-Dade, as did every statewide office. All this in spite of the fact DeSantis has become the Democrats' number two bogeyman, second only to Donald Trump. In the face of immense pressure, the governor refused to waver on his cultural agenda, just as he refused to acquiesce to the left's lockdown demands during the pandemic. He was unabashed in stopping critical race theory in schools, banning gender transitions for minors, and protecting women's sports from biologically male athletes. He sent illegal migrants to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nCome January, J.D. Vance will be a sitting Senator for the state of Ohio. He dispatched Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan relatively early in the night. Some thought Ohio was in the bag for Republicans from the start, but from July 1 to mid-October, FiveThirtyEight had Vance down in the polls, though the publication still gave Vance the edge to win the seat left by Republican Rob Portman. And though last night Vance was down early in the count, as is now to be expected for Republicans in the era of mail-in voting, Vance came roaring back. When the election was called for Vance by NBC News at 10:53 p.m., the Hillbilly Elegy author's lead was more than six points, similar to that of Trump's victories in the Buckeye state in 2016 and 2020. The man who wrote the book that helped explain why Ohio and heartland America went for Trump in 2016 will be bringing his working-class, Americans first message and agenda to the Senate.\n\nVance was helped in replicating Trump's success in part because he was on the ticket with incredibly popular incumbent Governor Mike DeWine, whom Vance thanked in his victory speech Tuesday evening. It is worth noting that DeWine cruised to reelection by a margin of 25 points, much more than Vance's six-plus point lead, but DeWine is just that popular-and higher interest in gubernatorial elections for Republicans is typical, given their localist leanings. As the Democrat Ryan tried to distance himself from the national party apparatus and its doubling down on the culture war, Vance remained focused on the national culture war, and was able to attach Ryan's voting record in Congress to liberal bogeymen like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Who can forget Vance's \"Are you a racist?\" ad, or his passionate response to Ryan's accusation of promoting the \"great replacement theory\" in a debate? It signaled to voters that he, like them, was tired of being baselessly called names.\n\nBut the campaign was more than pointing fingers at the media and Democrats for calling Americans racists for wanting to close an open southern border and stop the flow of illegal drugs. Vance backed that up with a strong platform of finishing Trump's border wall, doubling the number of border agents, curtailing levels of legal immigration, and a promise to never vote for amnesty. When Democrats planted their flag in the culture war, Vance's response helped voters identify that the ground Democrats had staked out was the root cause of American decline. Free trade, free money, and free sex and drugs have crippled Ohio and the nether parts of the country, first their industry, then their people's industriousness. Entire communities have collapsed. A vote for Vance was a recognition that economics works in tandem with culture, and that an American restoration requires bold, innovative strategies to improve both.\n\nMeanwhile, the antithesis of the Vance way of winning was on full display in Pennsylvania. Dr. Mehmet Oz managed to squeak by in the primaries thanks to the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. It was one of his more questionable endorsements from the beginning. The questions about Oz's viability as a candidate only grew as Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman opened about a ten point lead on Oz. Certainly, Oz had great name recognition and the sizable media platform that comes with Oprah fame, but when that platform pushes a message that simply isn't being well received by voters, it doesn't prove much good.\n\nThen Fetterman had a stroke. For months, Fetterman's campaign was more or less on hold. As it became clear that Fetterman was suffering cognitive and speech impairment, Democrats refused to make a change-like their ballots, Democrats thought they could just mail it in. Initially, it appeared the Fetterman campaign thought that it could copy the Democrat's 2020 strategy of keeping Biden in the basement. For a while, it appeared this gamble would pay off.\n\nOz began to climb back into the race as questions circulated about Fetterman's fitness, however, and Democrats brought Fetterman out from the basement to allay those fears. The reaction was the opposite of what Democrats had hoped. The race continued to tighten, and what FiveThirtyEight had as a 4 in 5 chance of Democrats flipping the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania became a dead heat in the final days of the cycle.\n\nBut at 1 o'clock in the morning Eastern Standard Time, NBC News called the Pennsylvania Senate race for Fetterman, as the margin began to open up to just over three points. The New York Times' graphic on county margin shifts compared to the 2020 presidential election is awfully telling. The only county that voted more Republican in favor of Oz than Trump in 2020 was Beaver County, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Elsewhere, in Elk, Clarion, Carbon, and rural counties across the state, Pennsylvania shifted more towards Fetterman-despite his clear cognitive issues. Pennsylvania voted for an invalid in 2020; we shouldn't be surprised they did so again in 2022.\n\nThough Oz was Trump's choice, he ran an establishment Republican campaign. At every turn for Oz to forcefully engage in the culture war, he balked. He pivoted to other issues-the economy, China, the war in Ukraine-he'd say almost anything to avoid planting a flag on immigration, on abortion, on identity politics. Oz may like Trump, but in no way is he Trumpian, and rural Pennsylvanians saw right through him. They knew that voting for Oz was a vote for the continuation of the status quo. And if the choice is between a liar or the large feeble-minded man that promised to support their blue-collar unions, the latter seemed a better choice.\n\nIn the coming days, when the establishment tries to regain its grip on party power and the Republican consulting class once again says the GOP must cater to suburban dads by recentering lower taxes, to suburban moms by easing our stance against abortion, to 2 percent of the black vote by talking about criminal justice reform, let Oz's defeat be a lesson to them.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "The numbers are in and the numbers are grim.\n\nDonald Trump can't catch a break.\n\nOnly a month removed from an attempt on his life and the woeful debate performance that forced President Joe Biden off the Democratic ticket, new polling suggests the Trump bump has faded and the Harris waltz is on.\n\nThree thousand five hundred registered voters polled by Reuters/Ipsos across an eight-day timeframe made one thing abundantly clear this week-what once looked like an easy climb to the White House has, in the strangest of fashion, become arguably Trump's toughest challenge yet.\n\nNot only is he down by four percent among registered voters (he was down only one percent in July), Harris is suddenly torching Trump in key demographics (women and Hispanics). Harris, who led Trump by nine points among women and six points among Hispanics in July is now up 13 with both demos in August. More troubling, Trump's lead among voters without a college degree, a demographic he relied on in his 2016 victory, has been slashed by half, from 14 points down to seven.\n\nAnd Harris has surprisingly-at least for Democrats-brought a fresh air to the race. In March, Reuters found that 61 percent of Democrats were voting for Biden as a means to \"stop Trump.\" Today's polling found that a majority of Democrats now say they are voting for Harris, not against Trump. The Vice President's ascendancy to the top of the ticket has allowed shy Biden supporters to become vocal Harris voters.\n\nAnd it's not just Reuters confirming the swing.\n\nData firm Target Smart told CBS News on Wednesday that \"among young black women, registration is up more than 175%\" across 13 states since Harris entered the race.\n\n\"I more than triple-checked it,\" said Target Smart's Tom Bonier . \"It's incredibly unusual to see changes in voter registration that are anywhere close to this. I mean, to remind people, 175 percent is almost a tripling of registration rates among this specific group. You just don't see that sort of thing happen in elections normally.\"\n\nAnd if things couldn't get worse for Trump, Fox News dropped its latest poll Wednesday finding Harris has \"closed the gap with Trump in the Sun Belt states.\"\n\n\"Harris is up by one percentage point in Arizona and by two points in Georgia and Nevada,\" noted Fox, whose polling division found one bright spot for Trump, arguing the former president was \"up one point in North Carolina.\"\n\nNot so fast. Just as Fox News was giving Trump a narrow lead in North Carolina, the Cook Political Report was moving the state from Trump's camp to a toss-up . A state that Trump led comfortably by a seven-point margin in July's aggregated polling is now Kamala's to lose .\n\nEven Nate Silver on Thursday afternoon couldn't overshadow what polls in state after state show-that the numbers have swung, in unison , toward Harris.\n\nWorse yet are the numbers for Trump's greatest fighters-the Arizonan Senate candidate Kari Lake and North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson.\n\nIn Arizona, Fox News finds Lake down 15 points and without a paddle. Phoenix-based pollster HighGround Public Affairs has Democratic challenger Ruben Gallego up 11. Despite a border plagued by drug and human trafficking, the Democrat Gallego is looking at a landslide while Republicans and their tough-on-the-border message are \" hemorrhaging support \" with Trump and Lake at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"The playbook she used in 2022 is not working in 2024,\" said Phoenix pollster Paul Bentz in response to the numbers.\n\nIn North Carolina too, MAGA's favorite son appears headed for a substantial loss. Though Trump and Harris are running neck to neck in the Sun Belt state, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is viewed unfavorably by more than half of the state's voters, and polling aggregate FiveThirtyEight finds Robinson reliably losing the governor's mansion by a wide margin .\n\nAnd it's not just the polling numbers that will have Trump heated over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nHis social media app Truth Social is a digital graveyard, so much so that the former president has begun posting campaign ads and statements to his X account. The stock price of Truth Social ($DJT) sank below $20 a share on Thursday, its lowest since going public and a far distant cry from its eye-watering $94 price tag in October of 2022.\n\nAmidst all of it, there was Trump on Wednesday resharing QAnon posts calling for military tribunals and \"The Storm.\" And although his allies in Congress and his political aides have publicly asked Trump to steer clear of personal attacks on Harris, Trump lobbed one of his most violent ones yet yesterday, suggesting that both Harris and the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton only achieved their positions of political power via sexual favors .\n\nThen, there was the incident at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday.\n\nWhat had at first appeared to be Trump's finest moment of the week-a lockstep salute honoring the fallen U.S. service members who were killed during Biden's botched withdrawal of Afghanistan-ended up being marred by controversy and made headline news for all the wrong reasons .\n\n\"An ANC [Arlington National Cemetery] employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\" read a tersely-worded statement by the U.S. Army on Thursday about the Trump campaign allegedly violating restrictions on using footage from the cemetery.\n\n\"This was unfortunate\" continued the letter which claims Trump staffers \" unfairly attacked \" a worker who attempted to stop staffers from taking images that could be used in political ads.\n\nThe Trump team later released a controversial video of his appearance on the former president's TikTok account. (The clip has since raked up more than nine million views .)\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Army reiterated in the statement that the Trump camp had been previously made aware of \"federal laws that clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds.\"\n\nTrump campaign manager Chris LaCivita, whose job security has been the source of speculation as Trump struggles on the trail, posted a video Thursday of Trump at Arlington. LaCivita doubled down: \"Hope this triggers the hacks at SecArmy.\"\n\nSo has been the trials and tribulations of Donald Trump these last few weeks as he heads into the final barrel roll. The bounce he hoped to win from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s (sort-of) exit from the race remains questionable as the independent presidential candidate has been unsuccessful in removing his name from several all-critical battleground states he promised to abandon.\n\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fought to get onto NC's ballot,\" read the headline from NC Newsline . \"Now he can't get off.\"\n\nAnd it's not just North Carolina where Bobby can't get off the ballot. In a cruel twist of irony for everyone involved, Kennedy looks set to remain on the ballots of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota as well.\n\nTrump still has the time and opportunity to turn things around but it's difficult to deny the aspects of the 2024 race which now appear clear-if he is to win it, again, it will be Trump the underdog.\n\nSpencer Neale is the Features Editor at The American Conservative .

      "text": "The European Union is reenacting the Soviet playbook in Romania.\n\nThis past weekend, Romania's electoral commission disqualified the frontrunner nationalist candidate, Calin Georgescu, from participating in May's upcoming presidential contest, the latest development in an electoral saga started with the controversial cancellation of the presidential elections last December. Vice President J.D. Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard already criticized the cancelling of the first round of elections as an example of democratic backsliding in the EU, but the latest developments present a geopolitical threat to American interests in an already volatile region, as well as a dire warning for the future of nationalist and anti-interventionist European parties.\n\nIn addition to representing a clear insult to the Trump administration, which Georgescu openly embraces , the EU is sending a clear warning to other members that populist-nationalist parties will not be allowed to gain power despite winning elections. To dispel any doubt about the larger meaning of this, during a discussion about the possibility of the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) coming to power, the former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton blatantly declared , \"We did it in Romania, and obviously we will do it in Germany.\" Washington must be clear-eyed about the kind of intransigent European Union leadership it will deal with for the foreseeable future, and conservatives in America must be similarly aware of the obstacles their European counterparts are likely to face. With leaders such as Ursula von der Leyen, Brussels represents the center of globalism and will be an ideological enemy to MAGA and any Trump-friendly European allies.\n\nThe context of the Romanian saga is that Georgescu, a former UN diplomat maliciously described as \"far right\" in the Western press for his Trumpesque populist-nationalist views, was poised to win the presidency in the second round last year, after placing first in the initial round of voting. The Romanian Constitutional Court, in an unprecedented move in Romania's post-Cold War democratic history, nullified the election based on alleged classified evidence provided by local intelligence services concerning Russian interference via TikTok. That such a ridiculous excuse of Russian support on TikTok would be considered sufficient reason to overturn an otherwise free and fair election in an EU country is exactly why Vance, along with Elon Musk and Kari Lake, recently criticized Romania's electoral machinations in social media postings .\n\nIn a move resembling the way Iran's ayatollahs decide which candidates are ideologically reliable enough to be trusted with continuing the Islamist theocratic regime, Romania's top court considered Georgescu's views to be a threat to \"the constitutional order and Romania's Euro-Atlantic partnership.\" And as unbelievable as it may sound for the highest court of a democratic EU and NATO member, this is the second time this election cycle the court banned a candidate from running for office based on this accusation of essentially advocating a nationalist, Eurosceptic foreign policy. Last year, Diana Sosoaca was similarly accused of representing a danger to national security for her conservative nationalist positions.\n\nIn a bitter irony, advocating for a ceasefire in Ukraine and refusing to continue Romania's unconditional support for that war, essentially the same policy adopted by the Trump administration, made Georgescu unacceptable to the Romanian judges and bureaucrats because of his supposed pro-Russian and therefore anti-Western views. Embracing peace in Ukraine and criticizing military interventionist policies as core principles of his campaign was deemed a threat to Romania's national security, a bizarre allegation that only makes sense to the European Union current leaders. Declaring opposing points of view illegal and dangerous is a Soviet practice that, unfortunately, some Romanian judges and leaders may have internalized a little too well during their communist youth.\n\nAs Vance eloquently emphasized in his speech at the Munich Security Conference in front of a stunned audience, the growing gap in transatlantic values is a dangerous trend, and EU's departure from democratic norms will make transatlantic cooperation more difficult. Romanian politicians often talk about democracy and the rule of law as key American and European values Romanians should aspire to after the tragic Cold War experience of Soviet-imposed communism and dictatorship. Yet the Romanian people have just been stripped of the most basic democratic right of choosing their own president with the explicit blessing of the very same European elites that style themselves unironically as defenders of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nSome may wonder whether an America First foreign policy rightly focused on China and the Western Hemisphere should even bother with the follies of European politics, but in this case the answer is yes-within limits. What, then, should be the prudent realist response to the Romanian coup?\n\nWhile not a top European power, Romania is nevertheless the EU's sixth largest country, and has been a valuable local American ally by hosting the American Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base (MKAB) on the Black Sea littoral and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System at Deveselu. Romanians value these military installations as a potential defense against Russian aggression much more than the U.S. does. This gives Washington important leverage; the administration could make this continued military support explicitly contingent on guarantees that other populist nationalist leaders such as George Simion (whom Georgescu now endorsed) will not be prevented from participating in the elections, or from serving as president should he win. Romania's status as a free and democratic state could also be revisited by the State Department, and the U.S. should consider sanctioning the public officials who organized the electoral coup.\n\nOn a broader scale, the EU-endorsed electoral coup in Romania should also lead to an increase in public diplomacy support to like-minded nationalist European parties from the Trump administration, the MAGA movement, and other conservative groups in the United States. The American national interest is ill-served by a uniformly globalist and liberal European Union, as the difficulties in working together to end the war in Ukraine make abundantly clear.\n\nDr. Ionut Popescu is an associate professor at Texas State University.

      "text": "Republican candidates win elections by getting more votes from Republican voters.\n\nNo red wave. That's the headline everywhere this week.\n\nSome people are disappointed; some are gloating; some are coping. I'm closest to the first group, but I've grown more optimistic over the course of these last few days.\n\nWith the notable exception of Senator J.D. Vance, everyone I liked who was locked in a tough race lost on Tuesday. Most of them lost big. But none of the losses is very difficult to explain, and none is much more difficult to resolve. There were plenty of surprises on Tuesday. But there aren't really any mysteries.\n\nFirst, some myths.\n\nThe red wave didn't fail because the GOP leaned too hard into the MAGA movement. For one thing, most of the hand-waving about ultra-mega-MAGA extremists this cycle hasn't actually been about the populist-nationalist conservatism signified by the slogan. It's been about \"election deniers,\" which is to say Republican candidates who don't get super excited about the \" shadow campaign \" to \"fortify\" the last election against a Trump victory.\n\nOne of the most prominent has been Kari Lake, the charismatic ex-TV host poised to defeat Katie Hobbs (who as secretary of state oversaw the controversial 2020 election) in the Arizona gubernatorial contest. Setting aside the fact that the vote-counting process has proven many of Lake's complaints about incompetence correct, plenty of other Trump loyalists have won or look poised to win their midterm contests too. If asking questions about 2020 is really such a killer, then all of these results will have to be explained.\n\nEven Doug Mastriano, the other ultra-mega-MAGA boogeyman of regime media and Resistance Twitter, didn't lose because he was too radical. He lost because he refused to run a campaign. He won the primary and then vanished into thin air, handing a winnable race to a far-left holdover from the unpopular incumbent government by a margin of 14 points. He dragged Dr. Mehmet Oz down with him, though the latter might have lost regardless by virtue of being a liberal.\n\nAnother myth: the red wave didn't fail because of Dobbs . Even with the stain of Roe wiped away, none but the most fanatical adherents of the death cult went to the polls on Tuesday with preserving abortion at the top of their minds; opinion data have shown this time and time again. Plenty of pro-life incumbents were resoundingly reelected, and plenty of pro-abortion challengers were trounced.\n\nThe Republican Party lost this week for the same reason it always loses: it's soft. Up against the party of infanticide and child mutilation and carnage in Ukraine, the best attack it could muster was \"...Inflation!\" It tacked to the center in all but a handful of general election campaigns in the desperate hope that Janice, 53, who voted third party in 2020 and for Gretchen Whitmer in 2018 and for Romney/Ryan in 2012 might just cast a ballot for John Gibbs.\n\nFor all its posturing, the Republican party refuses to acknowledge that the culture war is a war, and needs to be fought like one. You can win a war by convincing enough of the enemy soldiers to come over to your side. It's possible, in theory. But how many wars in all of human history have actually been won that way?\n\nRepublicans have to stop prioritizing peeling away blue voters, or even purple ones. When it happens naturally that's one thing, as when Richard Nixon's revival of traditional American conservatism delivered millions of blue-collar voters to a GOP nearly buried by radical liberal Barry Goldwater just four years before. When this bipartisan appeal is forced by a consultant class that couldn't find a viable candidate if he was perched on top of a border wall with a halo on his head, it flops. All those efforts should have ended when Donald Trump's first victory proved the conclusions of the 2012 moratorium completely and utterly bunk.\n\nMitt Romney didn't lose because he wasn't willing enough to let other countries eat America's lunch. Quite the opposite. Romney's America Last philosophy combined with his social liberalism made the 2012 nominee just un-exciting. Nobody shows up to the polls for a guy like that. You might gain an extra 5 percent or so of undecided and independent voters by nominating a squishy hack like Romney or Dr. Oz. But if you drop 20 percent of your most reliable supporters in the process, you're going to lose on election day every time.\n\nElections, especially swing-state elections, are about turnout. A Republican Party that wants to win needs to refocus on this fact, which secured Trump the White House in 2016 and handed Democrats the Senate in the 2020 runoffs.\n\nSure, Dr. Oz could have beat John Fetterman if a few hundred thousand Democrats had jumped ship to vote for him. Blake Masters (whose race is yet to be called) would have had a much easier ride if suburban women liked him better. But none of these things are worth talking about. Either man could have won by getting more Republicans to vote for him.\n\nThis should go without saying, but apparently it doesn't. So I'll say it twice: Republican candidates win elections by getting more votes from Republican voters. General election messaging, almost as much as primary messaging, should be aimed at the people who are actually going to get out and vote for the candidate. This election and plenty of others prove that their votes are not guaranteed; but they are still the most likely by far.\n\nAll this means, also, that Republicans should think about how to get the votes of Republican voters beyond just getting them excited by better candidates than Mastriano or Don Bolduc. There is no major election in living memory that Democrats would have won without massive, efficient political machines, especially in heavily populated cities. The influence of these machines has only grown as Covid-era overhauls made ballot harvesting a defining feature of elections all over the country. Democrat activists in battleground states know which retirement communities and neighborhoods to go to, which doors to knock on, which people to pack into vans. As long as these methods remain standard practice, and as long as election law remains unreformed, Republicans might start thinking, for instance, about which churches and neighborhoods deserve attention in the lead up to election day.\n\nAlmost as important as machine politics is old-school retail politics . As TAC contributing editor Sohrab Ahmari observed in the New York Times this week, the GOP's new populist messaging was undone on the campaign trail by a large-scale return to pre-Trump form: \"If you're a member of the downwardly mobile middle class, someone with a college degree but without a secure job, even as student-loan payments bear down on you, all this rhetoric telegraphs: You aren't getting any help .\" Ahmari points to Oz, who pitched himself as a \"small-government Republican\" and (somehow, miraculously) lost a state whose rural and blue-collar areas brought Trump to victory in 2016. Plenty of other candidates this cycle, for all the fretting about too much MAGA, fell back on warmed-over libertarianism.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have actually offered something to their base. In the months before the election, President Biden finally made moves towards fulfilling the campaign promise of transferring student debt away from borrowers. Somebody in his inner circle understood who his most important voters were: white millennials with college degrees. It was a blatant ploy, and the merits of the policy are irrelevant. What matters is that voters under 30 broke blue by huge margins in every important race, and they showed up.\n\nTwo can play at that game, and the GOP's only options are play or lose.\n\nDeclan Leary was a senior editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "Why a transpartisan ticket could still happen, although it looked likelier six months ago.\n\nRunning mate announcements usually come around July or August. During this interlude between the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, rumors are flurrying that presumptive nominee Donald Trump will choose former contenders Vivek Ramaswamy or the recently engaged Tim Scott. Donald Trump Jr. has indicated his preference for ideological alignment with the suggestions of J.D. Vance or Tucker Carlson. Some surveyors, those uninitiated in the spirit of Trump's second candidacy, suggest Kristi Noem or Elise Stefanik. And others slow down the internet with the suggestion of Nikki Haley.\n\nOutside the safe predictions, there remains the wild card pick of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Through his switch from the Democratic ticket to an independent run, the candidate has already indicated that he prioritizes the end of getting to the White House over the means.\n\nSome adjacent to Trump world don't seem to think it's such a crazy idea. Days after Kennedy announced his candidacy in April, Steve Bannon said he received a standing ovation from a \"hardcore MAGA, War Room posse crowd\" when he suggested that Kennedy would be worthy of Trump's consideration were Kari Lake not available. Longtime political operative Roger Stone, a week before Kennedy's announcement, floated the idea in a Substack post that, according to him, elicited more public comment than anything he'd ever written.\n\nThe problem with this idea is Trump's penchant for loyalty. Kennedy wrote the foreword to the January 2024 title Trump's War on Capitalism , an autopsy critical of the administration's policies written by Ronald Reagan's first Office of Management and Budget director, David Stockman. Kennedy also suggested in January that Trump overruled his own instincts in his treatment of Covid and the subsequent lockdowns.\n\nSome who were once supportive of the idea have backed away. Stone, one of the original public faces of the proposition, now tells The American Conservative that \"dynamics have changed dramatically since the time I mused about RFK as a potential running mate for Donald Trump.\" Stone's April article relied on the potentially positive electoral effects of a \"'bipartisan' unity ticket,\" citing John McCain's alleged interest in tapping the independent Democrat Joe Lieberman as his running mate in his 2008 bid.\n\nStone believes that the proposed ticket is no longer \"viable or plausible.\" He also worries that Kennedy's candidacy could mirror Ross Perot's effect on the election results of George H.W. Bush in 1992: \"All of the legitimate polling shows that if RFK succeeds in getting on the ballot, he draws a disproportionate number of votes from Trump, rather than Biden or whoever the Democrats replace Biden with.\"\n\nFormer Trump administration official Douglas Macgregor told TAC back in August for its profile of Kennedy that the pair would make \"a very powerful combination\" in a third party run. Now he says the idea is \"not plausible.\" Macgregor continues, \"I wish it were because it would undoubtedly sweep the opposition away, but to date the two men have been unable to even meet for the discussion.\"\n\nAnd according to our most recent interview, Kennedy himself does not seem to be interested in such a discussion. When asked whether he would be remotely interested in running with Trump, he replied, \"I would say the answer to that is no. I don't think my marriage would survive it.\" (Kennedy is married to actress Cheryl Hines of Curb Your Enthusiasm fame.)\n\nKennedy's popularity with voters under the age of 45 and independents poses a threat to both Trump and Biden. On the question of which candidate will be hurt more by Kennedy's candidacy, his own description of the political orientation of his supporters corroborates Stone's fear.\n\nAfter he transitioned to an independent candidate, Kennedy said, \"what we immediately saw was the enthusiasm of our voters increase. We had a lot of voters who like my campaign but were very wary of getting involved with the Democratic party.\" Between now and election day, Kennedy hopes to increase his appeal among baby boomers by making more appearances on network television. In the meantime, \"the younger kids talk to their parents [and] we're seeing a lot of conversions.\"\n\nThose who are wagering on a Trump-Kennedy ticket can't be blamed for thinking outside the box. The two men share similar instincts on trade, foreign policy, election integrity, and, more recently, immigration. They talk the same game about excluding neoconservatives from the White House and administrative agencies, curbing the influence of the military-industrial complex, and spreading out childhood vaccinations. Trump said in June that he respects Kennedy; Kennedy has not made Trump a primary target of his campaign. On January 27, anonymous sources told the New York Post the Trump team had already reached out to Kennedy about joining the ticket, which the Trump campaign denied.\n\nKennedy says he doesn't want the job. But would he turn down the offer?\n\nThis article appears in the March/April 2024 issue\n\nHarry Scherer is a contributing editor at The American Conservative .

      "text": "Fearless: Kari Lake debunks drag queen controversy, says 'commonsense' gay people don't want drag performers in schools\n\nLike her high-profile endorser, Kari Lake isn't afraid of a public fight or ashamed of her past.\n\nThe Donald Trump-backed Arizona gubernatorial candidate sparred with Fox News host Bret Baier on Monday over a Washington Post story that chastised Lake for hypocrisy on drag queens and schoolchildren. The Post published pictures of Lake and her husband socializing with a prominent Arizona drag performer who is upset by Lake's criticism of schools and libraries embracing drag queen story hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lake joined BlazeTV's \"Fearless with Jason Whitlock \" to clarify her stance and explain her connection to Richard Stevens, the performer who attacked Lake in the Post.\n\n\"I'll let you in on a little secret, Jason,\" Lake told Whitlock. \"Those pictures. I'm not ashamed of them at all. I have zero shame for those pictures. Those pictures, by the way, were taken off of my Instagram and Facebook. I'm so not ashamed of who I am and where I came from that I never take anything down.\n\n\"When I got into politics, most people would sanitize their life ... I knew that was there. I am who I am. And the people will either vote for me because they like our policies and they know that I love this state. I have a relationship with the people, but I don't run away from anything.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, Lake complained over Twitter : \"They took God out of schools and welcomed the Drag Queens. They took down our flag and replaced it with a rainbow. They seek to disarm Americans and militarize our Enemies. Let's bring back the basics: God, Guns, and Glory.\"\n\nThe tweet infuriated Stevens. Lake told Whitlock a gay staffer actually wrote the tweet.\n\n\"One of my staffers wrote that, and he happens to be a gay conservative,\" Lake said. \"And that's what triggered the female impersonator, the drag queen. I'm telling you that hardworking, commonsense gay men and women are even appalled by drag queens in schools. The issue is we don't want to put drag queens in schools, and it's happening. It's happening in our libraries, and taxpayer money is going to fund some of these. That's what the tweet was about.\n\n\"It triggered a man that I covered for 20 years, and he was a talented guy, funny guy, a former friend. But he has since become radicalized. And he's actually working for my opponent. So to take his story - which, there were many defamatory statements in his story. He's never been to my home. I never had him over to my home. That's defamatory. He even told the Washington Post ... that he put this story out to injure our campaign.\"\n\nDavid Reed"

      "text": "Trump admin to dismantle 'irretrievably broken' government media agency\n\n'From top to bottom this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday directing his administration to dismantle the United States Agency for Global Media and six other government offices.\n\nThe action will impact the USAGM's grantees and subsidiaries, including the Voice of America and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.\n\n'A significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States and promoting freedom and democracy.'\n\nTrump's order, \" Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy ,\" calls for the government entities to be \"eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\"\n\nThe president previously tapped Kari Lake, a former Arizona news anchor and former Republican gubernatorial and Senate candidate, as a senior adviser to the USAGM and the head of the VOA, a federal broadcasting network.\n\nThe USAGM and Lake released a statement on Saturday explaining the decision to shut down the agency and its affiliates, highlighting several of the \"most egregious findings,\" including \"massive national security violations,\" \"eye-popping self-dealing,\" and \"obscene over-spending.\"\n\nThe Trump administration slammed the agency for being \"a product that often parrots the talking points of America's adversaries,\" noting \"$100s-of-millions being spent on fake news companies.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the USAGM terminated its contracts with the media outlet, as well as Reuters and Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe USAGM's statement claimed that the agency was \"not salvageable.\"\n\n\"From top to bottom this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer - a national security risk for this nation - and irretrievably broken. While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule,\" the statement read.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the work that was done by self-interested insiders in coordination with outside activist groups and radical leftist advocacy organizations to 'Trump-Proof' the agency made it impossible to reform,\" the statement continued. \"In fact, they weren't just 'Trump-Proofing' the agency from political leadership; they were accountability-proofing the agency from the American people.\"\n\nThe agency noted that most of its staff would be placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nLake called the president's move \"a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States and promoting freedom and democracy.\"\n\nLast week, Lake posted a video on X explaining that the USAGM under the Biden administration entered into a $250 million annual lease for a new Washington, D.C., skyscraper. She stated that the building - featuring floor-to-ceiling windows, large fountains, Italian marble finishes, and at least 26 conference rooms - has sat empty.\n\n\"Here's the kicker: They already have a building that they're located in that is paid off,\" Lake stated.\n\nElon Musk responded to Lake's findings, stating, \"The government was spending a quarter billion dollars of your taxpayer money per year on an empty building!\"\n\nLake told Musk, \"Worse yet, this building is not even equipped to do TV or Media broadcasting. That would cost millions of dollars more to build out. And a well-connected broker walked away with a $10 million commission. A Colossal waste! I am terminating this lease on behalf of the American Taxpayer.\"\n\nTrump's executive action also directed the dismantling of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and the Minority Business Development Agency.\n\nTrump requested that the agencies' leaders submit a report within seven days to the Office of Management and Budget acknowledging their \"full compliance with this order and explaining which components or functions of the governmental entity, if any, are statutorily required and to what extent.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "'Our jaws DROPPED': Why Kari Lake waited 11 months to release alleged bribery tape\n\nA leaked recording between Kari Lake and Arizona GOP Chairman Jeff DeWit revealed that powerful people \"back east\" would stop at almost nothing to get her out of the Senate race.\n\nLake tells Glenn Beck that she recorded it because after DeWit was persistent that he came over to talk to her instead of discussing what he had planned on the phone, she \"just got a bad feeling about it.\"\n\nLake also was under the impression that there might be a threat, asking herself why he'd want to come to her door to talk to her.\n\n\"I just thought if there's a threat, if he's gonna' threaten me, I need to have this on recording,\" Lake says.\n\nAfter the recording was released, DeWit resigned.\n\n\"His resignation letter was bizarre,\" Glenn says, adding, \"Why would he resign and say I'm resigning because of her threat that she's got more tapes?\"\n\nLake tells Glenn that there were no more tapes.\n\n\"And that's what is so disturbing about it, that he thinks that his behavior has been so unethical, that he thinks there's worse stuff out there,\" she says.\n\nThe tape itself was recorded 11 months ago, but Lake didn't release it until now.\n\n\"I didn't want to release anything, and I also didn't listen to it. I taped it because I was afraid there was going to be a physical threat, and when there wasn't, I just kind of put the file away and never even dealt with it,\" Lake says.\n\nIt wasn't until recently that Lake relistened to the tape with her husband and daughter, horrified that it was \"so much worse\" than she remembered.\n\n\"My daughter was shocked. She said, 'Tell me that guy doesn't work in politics anymore.' I said, 'He heads up the Arizona GOP,' and she said, 'What are you going to do about it Mom?'\" Lake recalls.\n\n\"I didn't really want to put that out, but how disappointing when your kids hear something like that, and then you just sit on it,\" she adds.\n\nTo enjoy more of Glenn's masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV - the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\n\nBlazeTV Staff"

DeWit was elected chair of the Arizona Republican Party last year. Soon after, he urged Kari Lake to step back from politics for two years. 'There are very powerful people who want to keep you out,' he told you\n\n'So the ask I got today from back east was: \"Is there any companies out there or something that could just put her on the payroll to keep her out?'\n\nLake reacts with indignation.\n\n'This is about defeating Trump and I think that's a bad, bad thing for our country,' she said.\n\nLater, DeWit, who was chief operating officer on the Trump's 2020 campaign frames it differently.\n\n'Just say, is there a number at which....' he begins.\n\nLake cut in: 'I can be bought? That's what it's about.'\n\n'You can take a pause for a couple of years. You can go right back to what you're doing.'\n\nLake repeatedly rebuffs him and says she wouldn't do it for a billion dollars.\n\n'This is not about money, it's about our country,' she says.\n\nPressure is already growing on DeWit to step down as state party chairman\n\nLake described what happened to an audience at the Conservative Political Action Committee last year. 'They called me before and said I got to talk to you in person. It's can't be done over the phone,' she said, as she revealed how an unnamed person had tried to buy her off\n\nTwo sources confirmed DeWit's identity as the speaker.\n\nHe and his press secretary did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Lake's office also did not respond.\n\nAt the time of their conversation, Lake was publicly mulling a run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nAnd the episode reveals the tensions triggered after she refused to accept defeat in the 2022 Arizona governor race.\n\nShe emerged as a national figure, becoming a regular on Fox News as she echoed Trump's election denialism. That put her at odds with the more traditional wing of the Republican Party who feared a new breed of Trump loyalist may alienate big donors.\n\nIn October, she announced her run.\n\nLake has previously discussed the extraordinary effort to keep her out of the race, but never revealed who was behind it.\n\nOn Monday, Arizona talk show host Garret Lewis named DeWit, who was elected chairman of the party in January last year.\n\nHe was state treasurer of the party before being appointed by Trump to be NASA's chief financial officer.\n\nArizona party officials quickly called for him to step down as news of his offer to Lake spread.\n\nDeWit was nominated to be the chief financial officer of NASA by the Trump administration. He was confirmed by the Senate in 2018 and stepped down two years later\n\nLake is frequently talked about as possible vice presidential pick for Trump's 2024 ticket\n\n'If this is, in fact, true, I'm asking AZGOP Chairman Jeff DeWit to resign.\" said Maricopa County Republican Committee Chairman Craig Berland.\n\nIt is latest in a string of scandals to hit state Republican Parties. Earlier this month the Florida party ousted its chairman after the police said he was being investigated for sexual assault.\n\nThe new 10-minute audio clip includes DeWit asking for secrecy.\n\n'If you say no, its fine, it's your choice, don't tell people,' he tells Lake.\n\nLater he sets out the rationale behind the offer.\n\n'I think what it really comes down to for a lot of people, it's not about like control or agenda,' he says. 'It's about the ability to raise money to win.'\n\nLake sticks to her guns.\n\n'I don't want to make a deal with these kinds of people.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\n'America's Newsroom' panelists Sabrina Singh and Bill McGurn discuss the Democratic Party's anti-Doge messaging and pushback on Elon Musk.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the U.S.-funded news outlet created to reach people living under communism during the Cold War, is suing Kari Lake and the Trump administration over efforts to defund the organization.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, said the station has not been paid a $7.5 million invoice submitted Monday. It claims the funding freeze undermines Congress's purse strings. Both entities are funded by government grants, with around 1% coming from private donations and other sources, the lawsuit states.\n\n\"Whether to disburse funds as directed by appropriations laws, and whether to make those funds available through grants as directed by the International Broadcasting Act, is not an optional choice for the agency to make,\"  the lawsuit said. \"It is the law. Urgent relief is needed to compel the agency to follow the law.\"\n\nMD GOV DEFENDS $190K TRUMP-CENTRIC IRISH CONSULTANT CONTRACT AS POTUS MOVES IN NEXT DOOR\n\nPresident Donald Trump stands next to Kari Lake on stage during a campaign rally at Findlay Toyota Center on October 13, 2024, in Prescott Valley, Arizona. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)\n\nIf funding doesn't resume, the station will be forced to lay off employees that work to bring news coverage to 23 countries in Europe and Asia in 27 languages.\n\n\"This is not the time to cede terrain to the propaganda and censorship of America's adversaries,\" RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus said in a statement. We believe the law is on our side and that the celebration of our demise by despots around the world is premature.\"\n\nThe lawsuit names U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), Victor Morales, the acting USAGM CEO, and Kari Lake, a former television anchor in Arizona who later ran for governor and senator who serves as a senior advisor to Morales, as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit came days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to eliminate USAGM.\n\nLAWMAKERS FROM STATE WITH MOST FEDERAL WORKERS PER CAPITA WARN AGAINST TRUMP BUYOUT BID\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the Elon Musk-led DOGE has slashed billions in what it deems as waste government spending. (Musk: Reuters / Money: iStock / Trump: Getty)\n\nLeaders in Europe have warned that Radio Free Europe could struggle to find funding to replace the cuts made by Trump.\n\nOn Monday, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky urged European Union ministers at a meeting in Brussels to consider ways to allow the Prague-based service to continue. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called Radio Free Europe \"a beacon of democracy\" and said it was sad that the U.S. had decided to cut its funding, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Can we come in with our funding to ... fill the void that U.S. is leaving? The answer to that question is ... not automatically, because we have a lot of organizations who are coming with the same request to us,\" she told reporters.\n\nRadio Free Europe began broadcasting in 1950 to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary , Romania, and Bulgaria, all countries that were behind the Iron Curtain. Radio Liberty started broadcasting to the Soviet Union in 1953.\n\nBoth entities were alternative news sources to the media controlled by the Soviet Union and other communist governments.\n\nLouis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nArizona Senate candidate Kari Lake weighs in on the border crisis and rumors she's a potential vice presidential pick for former President Trump on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'\n\nThe Senate Republicans' campaign arm is throwing its support behind Kari Lake in battleground Arizona's crucial race, a contest that could determine if the GOP wins back control of the chamber in November.\n\nTuesday's announcement by National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen. Steve Daines is the latest sign that Lake is moving past her outsider and fiery election-denial-centered 2022 campaign for Arizona governor and is capable of working with the GOP establishment.\n\n\"Kari Lake is one of the most talented candidates in the country. Kari is building out an effective campaign operation that has what it takes to flip Arizona's Senate seat in November. I'm proud to endorse Kari Lake for United States Senate,\" Daines, the Republican senator from Montana who is chairing the NRSC this cycle, said in a statement.\n\nTHE TOP FIVE SENATE SEATS LIKELY TO FLIP IN NOVEMBER\n\nFormer Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake announces her bid for the seat of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Oct. 10, 2023, in Scottsdale. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)\n\nLake is a former longtime local TV news anchor in Arizona who's a strong supporter of former President Donald Trump and his unproven claims his 2020 election loss to President Biden was due to massive voter fraud. She sparked plenty of controversy in her narrow 2022 gubernatorial election loss. Lake never conceded her more than 17,000-vote defeat and repeatedly and unsuccessfully challenged the results in court.\n\nBut since announcing her Senate bid last October, Lake has consistently courted the NRSC and establishment Republicans, most recently last weekend at the campaign committee's winter meeting in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"I am honored to have the endorsement of Chairman Daines and the NRSC,\" Lake said in a statement, which was first reported by Politico. \"We are uniting Republicans in Arizona and have a clear path to victory. The Senate Majority runs through Arizona.\"\n\nFIRST ON FOX: TOP SENATE REPUBLICAN TO BOOST LAKE WITH KEY ENDORSEMENT\n\nDaines and the NRSC have been much more hands on in GOP Senate primaries - in candidate recruitment and efforts to dissuade others from running - in comparison to the committee during the 2022 cycle under then-chairman Sen. Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nSen. Steve Daines speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 9, 2023. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe NRSC backed candidates Tim Sheehy in Montana and Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania as they launched their campaigns. But while Daines has complimented Lake in recent months, he has waited until now for an official endorsement.\n\nIn Arizona, Lake faces a nominal rival in Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, and she's considered the overwhelming favorite to win the nomination.\n\nFox News has confirmed that the NRSC will host a fundraiser for Lake on March 6, which will be attended by Daines as well as Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Senate GOP Conference chair.\n\nBarrasso, the number three Republican in Senate GOP leadership, had previously endorsed Lake and plans to campaign with her in Arizona on Feb. 29.\n\nDemocrats control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs. Three of those seats are in red states that Trump carried in 2020 - West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.\n\nFive other blue-held seats are in key swing states narrowly carried by President Biden in 2020 - Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nFrom left, Republican Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb, Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and former gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake (Getty Images)\n\nOnce reliably red, Arizona has become a key southwestern general election battleground state.\n\nThe state narrowly voted in 2018 for then-Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in a crucial Senate race, and for President Biden and Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in 2020.\n\nLake was narrowly defeated for governor in 2022, while Kelly won election to a full six-year term in the Senate by five points.\n\nThis year's Senate election in Arizona remains complicated as Sinema, who is now an independent, has not yet decided whether she will run for re-election.\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego is the frontrunner for the Democratic Senate nomination, and the possibility of a three-way contest with Sinema, Gallego and Lake has some Republicans salivating.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took aim at their GOP counterpart and at Lake following the news.\n\n\"Kari Lake is the poster child for Senate Republicans' candidate quality problem and abysmal recruiting strategy, DSCC spokesperson Tommy Garcia charged in a statement. \"An election loser despised by Arizona Republicans, Lake brings massive baggage and disqualifying flaws to the campaign. We're thrilled with the NRSC's choice.

      "text": "'Lot Of Nonsense': Kari Lake Announces Voice Of America Is Dumping Legacy Outlets\n\nSpecial Adviser for the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) Kari Lake announced Friday that Voice of America (VOA) will terminate its contracts with The Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.\n\nVOA, an international broadcasting state media network, is funded by USAGM, with former President Joe Biden requesting in March 2024 a budget increase for the 2025 fiscal year to further support the radio network. In an X post on Friday, Lake announced USAGM will end its \"expensive and unnecessary newswire contracts ,\" adding that some of the major agreements included \"tens-of-millions of dollars in contracts\" with AP News, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.\n\n\"USAGM is an American taxpayer funded News Organization with an 83-year history. We should not be paying outside news companies to tell us what the news is-with nearly a billion-dollar budget, we should be producing news ourselves,\" Lake wrote. \"And if that's not possible, the American taxpayer should demand to know why.\"\n\nDuring a meeting with VOA staffers Friday, employees were reportedly told to \"stop using wire service material for their reports,\" according to Newsmax. Notably, audio, video, and text reports have often been used to supplement coverage from locations where reporters are not present, the outlet reported.\n\nIn an interview with Newsmax prior to the official contract cuts, Lake discussed how the agency was finding \"a lot of nonsense that the American taxpayer shouldn't be paying for.\"\n\n\"Today, I started the process of terminating the agency's contracts with the Associated Press, Reuters, & the Agence France-Presse. This will save taxpayers about 53 million dollars. The purpose of our agency is to tell the American story. We don't need to outsource that responsibility to anyone else,\" Lake wrote in an X post regarding the interview.\n\nDisputes between The AP and the White House began in February after the corporate media outlet was revoked press access for refusing to call the Gulf of America by its new name. The AP filed a lawsuit on Feb. 21 against White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich for injunctive relief.\n\nLake was sworn in as USAGM's special adviser on March 3, saying she's \"looking forward\" to serving America and \"streamlining\" the agency. The cuts from the agency follow President Donald Trump's push for his second administration to review the government's wasteful spending.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Rumble/Fox News)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Kari Lake's Senate Bid Ends In Defeat In Toss-Up Arizona Race\n\nDemocratic Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego defeated Republican candidate Kari Lake to become Arizona's next senator in a competitive race that took nearly a week to project a winner.\n\nGallego edged out Lake by more than 70,000 votes as of 6:33 a.m. with more than 95% of votes counted. Decision Desk HQ projected Gallego's victory at 8:57 p.m. on Nov. 9 with 88% of votes counted. The AP called the race for Gallego at 11:49 p.m. Monday.\n\nGracias, Arizona! pic.twitter.com/fWQ3AetOsy\n\n- Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) November 12, 2024\n\nGallego's victory is a consolation prize for Senate Democrats who lost four seats after suffering losses in West Virginia, Ohio, Montana and Pennsylvania. Senate Republicans will control 53 seats for the first two years of President-elect Donald Trump's second term while the Democrats hold 47.\n\nGallego has represented Arizona's Third Congressional District since 2015 and is a former member of the left-wing Congressional Progressive Caucus. Gallego's 2022 reelection campaign notably called the candidate a \"true progressive voice in Congress\" in a fundraising email.\n\nGallego has pledged to expand abortion rights by codifying the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade and has co-sponsored legislation that would enact a ban on so-called \"assault weapons.\" \"\n\n\"I will always defend abortion rights,\" Gallego told supporters in a victory speech livestreamed on X last night.\n\nGallego is replacing Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who did not run for reelection, after she faced mounting criticism from Democrats over her refusal to support left-wing policy priorities, such as eliminating the legislative filibuster.\n\nArizona Gov. Katie Hobbs defeated Lake by less than a 20,000 vote margin during the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial contest, which Lake has not conceded .\n\nThe National Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm, endorsed Lake in February before the state's contested Republican senate primary in August during which Lake won 55% of the vote.\n\nLake consistently underperformed President Donald Trump throughout the campaign. Lake trailed the GOP presidential ticket by 3.5 percentage points, according to RealClear Polling (RCP) average of the presidential race in Arizona on election day.\n\nGallego will join Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate. Kelly defeated Republican candidate Blake Masters during Arizona's competitive Senate contest in 2022.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Kari Lake: Arizona Will Do What Washington Won't - Finish the Wall and Defend Our State\n\nThe ongoing humanitarian and security crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is ravaging Arizona communities and threatening the stability of our civil society.\n\nA record 2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended by Customs and Border Protection last year, with an estimated 400,000 individuals evading apprehension and disappearing into the interior of the U.S.\n\nNearly a quarter of those who evaded apprehension came through the Tucson sector. So far in the first two months of fiscal year 2022, apprehensions are up 2,400 percent in the Yuma sector alone.\n\nEven when the Biden administration isn't intentionally demonizing our brave Border Patrol agents trying to do an impossible job, agents remain overwhelmed by the crisis and demoralized by Washington's disinterest and ineptitude.\n\nCompounding this humanitarian disaster is the fact that over 11,000 pounds of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl were seized by Border Patrol agents in 2021, trafficked by murderous drug cartels who have operational control over large swaths of the border. The fentanyl seized last year alone is enough to potentially kill over 2.5 billion people - almost a third of the entire world population.\n\nIn Arizona 2,644 of our citizens died from drug overdoses and fentanyl poisonings in 2020 - a spike of 34 percent from the previous year. According to DEA data, cartels are responsible for the vast majority of fentanyl entering the U.S., which they lace into other narcotics or counterfeit medications and smuggle into our communities.\n\nAll of this chaos, death and violence stems from these violent narco-terrorists operating freely at the U.S.-Mexico border. Responsibility for failing to solve the problem, however, falls squarely at the feet of the Biden administration and Washington Democrats.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's willful refusal to pursue and enact the federal policies necessary to secure the southern border has made it clear that states must boldly step into the breach and do what Washington, D.C., simply will not: protect the citizens of Arizona and finally put an end to the chaos and human misery caused by our unsecured border with Mexico.\n\nAs governor, I intend to do precisely that starting on Day 1.\n\nUnder my \"Defend Arizona\" plan, Arizona will invoke its inherent authority under Article I of the U.S. Constitution to repel the invasion occurring on our border. The federal government has an obligation under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution to guarantee protection to the states. However, if Washington refuses to live up to its obligations, Arizona is not bound to simply take the abuse.\n\nAs governor, I will call for the creation of a compact of like-minded states to secure the border. This compact will establish an interstate commission overseeing joint border security operations comprised of law enforcement resources from member states.\n\nThe compact will provide for states to not only arrest illegal immigrants crossing into Arizona, but also to return them back across the border. We will keep Washington informed of our efforts, but Arizona will not seek permission to defend ourselves. In our federalist system, states are sovereign and we will exercise our inherent powers to resolve this crisis.\n\nSimultaneously, we will deter lawlessness by finishing the uncompleted portions of former President Trump's border wall . I will expand the Arizona Rangers and refocus them as a special state-funded force tasked with cracking down on cartel thugs and criminal activity along our border with Mexico.\n\nAdditionally, I will expand the Arizona National Guard's mission on the border and task them with destroying human trafficking and drug smuggling tunnels. And I will provide for the deputizing of retired law enforcement and military veterans to join in our efforts to put an end to the madness.\n\nWe will establish a process to deport criminals back across the border into Mexico. This begins with empowering law enforcement to make trespassing arrests under state law. As part of expanding this capacity, I will work with the Legislature to create a special border court within our Superior Court system to process illegal immigrants arrested under our trespassing laws.\n\nAnd just as our friends in Texas have done, I will authorize the Arizona National Guard to arrest illegal immigrants who trespass. However, I will go further and task the Guard with actively returning illegal immigrants back across the border.\n\nLastly, we will defend our great state by expanding and redeploying elite law enforcement units, such as the Border Strike Force Bureau, to the southern border.\n\nI will work with the Legislature to create a publicly accessible database to keep track of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. And I will establish a new task force run out of the governor's office to work closely with the Cocopah Tribe and Tohono O'odham to find effective and mutually respectful ways to secure the border that runs through tribal territory.\n\nWe will ensure the safety of all those who call Arizona home.\n\nOur Defend Arizona policy has been endorsed by Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. I am honored to have his endorsement as I seek the support of my fellow Arizonans to defend our great state.\n\nAs governor, I will not hesitate to do what needs to be done to restore security and sanity to our border, nor I will not wait for Washington's approval or rely on the empty promises of faraway politicians to do what's best for Arizonans.\n\nThe time is now. Together, we will secure our state, safeguard our communities, and pave a brighter and more secure future for Arizona.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Kari Lake Closing the Gap, Majority of Uncounted Ballots Are from 'Ruby Red' Districts\n\nAs the nail-biting tension of the race for governor of Arizona continues to unfold, a new report offers a bit of optimism for supporters of Republican Kari Lake.\n\nDemocrat Katie Hobbs has been in the lead since Election Night after a hard-fought campaign between Lake and Hobbs.\n\nOn Saturday, Hobbs defied predictions that she would lose her lead when 85,000 votes from Maricopa County were tallied. With those counted, she was clinging to a 1.6 percentage-point lead, according to KSAZ-TV.\n\nBut Saturday closed with about 270,000 votes left to count, and Hobbs up by about 35,000 votes.\n\nOn Sunday, Garrett Archer, an elections analyst with KNXV-TV suggested that the erosion in the lead held by Hobbs that Republicans have been waiting for could be finally beginning.\n\nAbout 90k of the remaining 170k uncounted EVs are from the ruby red CDs 5, 8, and 9. Another 70k from purple CDs 1 and 4. https://t.co/AAijIbiNyF\n\n- The AZ - abc15 - Data Guru (@Garrett_Archer) November 13, 2022\n\n\"About 90k of the remaining 170k uncounted EVs are from the ruby red CDs 5, 8, and 9. Another 70k from purple CDs 1 and 4,\" he wrote in a Twitter post, referring to early votes in the state's congressional districts.\n\nThe comment was in line with a tweet from Saturday.\n\n?. Being that guy again.\n\nToday's 85K batch only included a portion of this 114K. The reason you haven't seen any calls, is b/c The agencies know this is coming.\n\nIt's not a question that Rs will win the next batches. Only a question of by how much. https://t.co/ZUnoNIHwb9\n\n- The AZ - abc15 - Data Guru (@Garrett_Archer) November 13, 2022\n\n\"It's not a question that Rs will win the next batches. Only a question of by how much,\" he wrote in a separate tweet.\n\nHowever, Republican pollster Paul Bentz of the Phoenix firm HighGround had been less rosy on Lake's chances , according to the Arizona Republic .\n\n\"There's still a path to victory here for Lake,\" Bentz said.\n\n\"But she needs these remaining rounds of ballots to be incredibly Republican-leaning from here on out. She can't afford to have another round of returns on this level; otherwise, it will make it incredibly difficult to come back,\" he said.\n\nLake said after the polls closed that she would be patient, but that she also had faith.\n\n\"God did not put us in this fight because it was going to be easy,\" Lake said Tuesday, according to KSAZ-TV . \"Not one thing that we've had to go through has been easy.\n\n\"We're gonna be patient. We're gonna wait,\" Lake said. \"We will take the victory when it comes, and we will turn this around.\"\n\n[ic_related]\n\nOn Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo\" on Sunday, Lake said Hobbs, who is currently Arizona's secretary of state and as such oversees elections, should have recused herself from that role because of her candidacy for governor.\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com \"We called for her to recuse herself July of last year, 2021, right after we got into the race, recognizing that there's a major ethical problem there. Obviously, just the optics of it looks bad. And she didn't do that,\" Lake said .\n\n\"Even though many people [have] been calling for her to recuse herself, it creates problems, to say the least.\"\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

They called me before and said, 'I got to talk to you in person. This can't be done over the phone.'\"\n\nShe went on:\n\n\"They came to my door and they tried to bribe me out of getting out of politics. It's really happened. I'm telling you this because this is how disgusting politics is. A mom who runs for office and they're afraid of me? They tried to bribe me with a job title, with a huge salary, a position on a board. This is how they do it.\"\n\nLake noted she \"walked away from a big job and a big salary\" and said she is \"not motivated by that stuff.\"\n\nKari Lake Alleges 'Powerful People Back East' Offered Her A Bribe To Sit Out Of Politics For 2 Years @KariLake @KariLakeWarRoom pic.twitter.com/VpMpXDCLNf - Red Voice Media (@redvoicenews) March 4, 2023\n\nKari Lake Alleges 'Powerful People Back East' Offered Her A Bribe To Sit Out Of Politics For 2 Years @KariLake @KariLakeWarRoom pic.twitter.com/VpMpXDCLNf\n\nThe conservative firebrand asserted \"some powerful people back East\" were behind the effort.\n\nAfter sharing she rebuffed the attempt, Lake claimed the individual tried again and told her, \"All we're asking for you to do is to get out of politics for two years.\"\n\nGiven Lake's affinity for claiming to be the governor of Arizona when she is not, it would not be surprising if some details of the conversation were left out or twisted to suit her purpose.\n\nBut even if the conversation was conveyed accurately, it was more likely the result of political operatives being scared to death that Lake could cost Republicans yet another election in 2024 than trying to \"silence\" her supporters.\n\nShe lost the race for governor in a year expected to be excellent for Republicans. Her defeat came four years after the Republican governor at the time won re-election by 15 percentage points in a rough year for Republicans.\n\nLake has also expressed some openness to running for Senate in Arizona in 2024.\n\nDemocrats would probably love to run against Lake in the Senate race.\n\nAnd if she did run, Democrats could easily weaponize her efforts to undermine the 2022 election's legitimacy, and bizarre claims to be governor against her - likely keeping the seat out of Republicans' hands for another six years at least.\n\nIf Republicans are concerned about Lake running for Senate - or some other office - in 2024, they should focus on finding quality candidates who can beat her in the primary. Trying to coax her out of politics with a cushy job offer reeks of the kind of backroom deals so many on the populist Right rail against, and it could have the opposite of its intended effect.\n\nIJR, Senior Writer\r\nHe's written for Independent Journal Review since 2019.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

Congratulations Kari!\" he added.\n\nTrump previously criticized VOA during his first term for its coverage in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. He accused the VOA of utilizing U.S. taxpayer money \"to speak for authoritarian regimes.\" Trump's grievance revolved around the fact that VOA's reporting on COVID-19 infections and deaths was based on misleading, skewed data and reports from the Chinese government, a U.S. adversary.\n\nMeanwhile, Lake responded to Trump's announcement in an X post, expressing her excitement for the new role.\n\n\"I am honored that President Trump has asked me to lead the Voice of America. @VOANews is a vital international media outlet dedicated to advancing the interests of the United States by engaging directly with people across the globe and promoting democracy and truth,\" Lake stated.\n\n\"With an audience of 326 million people, Voice of America delivers information in 48 languages.

      "text": "Bill Clinton Calls Kari Lake 'Attractive' While Endorsing Her Opponent for Senate: 'Can't Help Himself'\n\nOAN Staff Brooke Mallory 5:03 PM - Thursday, October 24, 2024\n\nKari Lake, a staunch Trump supporter and U.S. Senate candidate from Arizona, was referred to as \"physically attractive\" by former President Bill Clinton on Wednesday night at a campaign event alongside her opponent.\n\nClinton shared his thoughts on the Arizona campaign when he appeared with 44-year-old Democrat contender Ruben Gallego, while accidently making a slight blunder that prompted some smirks in the crowd.\n\nBill Clinton says Kari Lake is physically attractive. #BillClinton #KariLake #Breaking #Latest #2024Election #News #OAN #OneAmericaNews pic.twitter.com/8owuXopLvw\n\n\"This is like a beautiful microcosm of the campaign that Kamala Harris is running for president,\" Clinton said. \"You got a person that grew up under sometimes challenging circumstances, who made something of his life running against someone who is physically attractive but believes that politics is a performance Art, and where, like JD Vance, she has to be prostate before the master.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old former Democrat president (hopefully) meant to say \"prostrate.\"\n\nIn 2022, Lake, 55, made headlines as a gubernatorial candidate after becoming well-known in the Phoenix area as a popular television news anchor.\n\nSince then, she now faces off against Gallego, a 10-year member of Congress and Marine veteran. This year's race is for the Senate seat left empty by Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who won as a Democrat before switching to the Independent party.\n\nClinton has a long-standing reputation for a being a womanizer and adulterer, dating back to his 1993-2001 presidency when he had an affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky, whom he later falsely denied having sexual relations with.\n\nHe also recently made strange comments at Ethel Kennedy's funeral, where he claimed that she would constantly flirt with him and try to seduce him, prompting strange looks and laughs as he seemingly forgot that he was at a 96-year-old woman's funeral with her whole family in attendance.\n\nAdditionally, during a recent event in Georgia, Clinton brought up the topic of illegal immigration and accused Republicans of sabotaging a border bill.\n\nHowever, during his condemnation, he accidentally touched on the fact that the Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the death of a young nursing student who was raped and brutally killed by an illegal alien from Venezuela.\n\n\"You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? They made an ad about it. A young woman who had been killed by an immigrant,\" he stated, referring to the now-deceased Laken Riley, 22. \"Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened,\" he added, echoing talking points by the Trump campaign.\n\nOne America News reached out to Kari Lake's Senatorial campaign to get a comment about how she feels in regards to Bill's flattering description of her.\n\n\"When we heard Bill was coming to town, we thought we'd have to protect our interns from him, little did we know, it was our candidate we needed shield!\" said Colton Duncan, senior advisor to Kari Lake.\n\nI love you, Tempe! 💙 pic.twitter.com/ZZ9PXaKXn6\n\nWATCH: Kari Lake's FULL Debate With Radical Ruben Gallego If you have ANY friends or family members that are undecided or considering voting for Ruben, please send them this and ask them to watch it before they cast their ballot.

Meanwhile, 5% said they were not sure which candidate they would cast a ballot for. One percent said they support another candidate.\n\nAdditionally, Gallego saw a higher approval rating than Lake, where 58% of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of the Republican and 38% had a favorable view. Gallego had an equal favorable and unfavorable rating of 46% each.\n\nFurthermore, Gallego polled higher than Lake among young voters (56% to 32%) and female voters (54% to 37%).\n\nThe conducted survey polled a total of 783 likely voters online, and had a margin of error of plus and minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nLake, a former news anchor in Arizona, has been endorsed by 45 th President Donald Trump.\n\nDespite the polling not falling in her favor, Lake is not worried.\n\n\" I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,\" Lake said. \"And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.\"\n\nShe is confident that the polling is much closer than what is being let on.\n\n\"We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,\" Lake stated. \"This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.\"\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

      "text": "Trump-Backed Kari Lake Knocked Doors for Obama, Former Colleague Says\n\nKari Lake-the self-proclaimed \"only conservative\" in the race for Arizona governor-volunteered to knock doors for the Obama campaign while she worked as a news anchor, according to a former colleague.\n\nLast month, Lake's longtime Fox 10 Phoenix colleague told former Pinal County sheriff Paul Babeu (R.) that Lake \"went door to door canvassing for Barack Obama\" during her time at the network, Babeu told the Washington Free Beacon . The former colleague, who requested anonymity to speak freely, confirmed that the conversation with Babeu took place and said the allegation about Lake's work for Obama emerged in the Fox 10 newsroom after Lake announced her candidacy for governor. Her Republican campaign has shocked coworkers given her political activity while at the network.\n\nThe allegation that Lake knocked on doors for a Democratic presidential candidate is at odds with her rhetoric on the campaign trail, where Lake has positioned herself as the \"only conservative, America First Trump Republican in the race.\" It is not, however, surprising given her past political activity-the Free Beacon reported last year that Lake in 2004 made her first ever political contribution to then-Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Four years later, in 2008, Lake registered as a Democrat and contributed to Obama's first presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to Lake's former colleague , Lake campaigned for Obama with Stephanie Angelo, who in 2008 was married to a different Fox 10 colleague, Troy Hayden. A veteran Arizona Democratic operative who was working in the state in 2008 identified Angelo as one of the party's most committed volunteers at the time and said Angelo and Lake were \"best friends.\"\n\nNeither Lake's campaign nor Angelo returned a request for comment. Hayden declined to comment, as Fox 10 employees are barred from discussing Lake's candidacy with outside media outlets.\n\nLake left her job as a Fox 10 anchor in March 2021, citing her disapproval of the \"obvious bias\" and \"liberal ideology\" in mainstream media. On the campaign trail, she regularly attacks the \"biased media\" for working to tip the scales in Democrats' favor. If the allegations are true, Lake appears to have embodied the media behavior she now says forced her to quit the industry.\n\nLake's alleged behavior doesn't just contradict her rhetoric-network policy bars employees from campaigning for political candidates.\n\nLake worked to sidestep criticism of her past financial support for Democrats first by blaming the donations made in her name on her ex-husband, which would be illegal . She then said she evolved politically. \"Look at Ronald Reagan,\" Lake told one interviewer who pressed her on her donations to Democrats. \"He was a former Democrat. What's the problem with it?\" Lake also says the Democratic Party has grown more radical since she supported Kerry and Obama. (Lake's 2008 donation to Obama came shortly after National Journal ranked the Illinois Democrat the most liberal senator.)\n\nIn addition to her campaign donations to Democrats, Lake has pushed for liberal immigration policies such as amnesty and criticized former president Donald Trump. In a 2016 Facebook post , Lake said it was \"impossible\" to implement Trump's \"plan to deport 11 million immigrants\" and argued that the United States should instead allow illegal immigrants to \"legally\" reside in the country as they await citizenship. One year later, Lake blasted Trump's infamous Charlottesville press conference as \"a real $hit$how\" and said Trump showed \"absolutely no self control.\"\n\nLake landed Trump's endorsement nonetheless. She now professes her \"love\" for the former president, says Trump should be put on Mount Rushmore, and promises to \"send National Guard Troops to the border\" to deport \"illegal aliens invading Arizona.\"\n\nTrump's support has propelled Lake to the front of a crowded Republican primary field, which includes land developer Karrin Taylor Robson and former Republican congressman Matt Salmon. According to a Wednesday OH Predictive Insights poll , Lake leads the race with 29 percent support to Taylor Robson's 22 percent and Salmon's 11 percent.\n\nPublished under: 2022 Election , Arizona , Arizona Governor , Kari Lake\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "'They've Refused To Call a Terrorist a Terrorist': Voice of America's Demise Comes After Years of Liberal Training Sessions, Pro-Iran Bias, and Even Russian Propagandists\n\nWhen President Donald Trump moved this weekend to dismantle Voice of America, the government-run news network long denounced by conservatives for liberal bias, MSNBC wrote that the move brought an end to \"pro-democracy media outlets\" countering \"authoritarian propaganda\" abroad. But VOA's liberal staffers have not only faced criticism for running a left-wing broadcaster similar to NPR; they're also accused of operating with a pro-Iran bent, producing anti-Israel news coverage, and, in at least two cases, publishing Russian propagandists.\n\n\"There have been complaints that they've been very pro-Hamas, that they've refused to call a terrorist a terrorist,\" former Arizona news anchor Kari Lake told the Washington Free Beacon . Lake has been tapped by Trump to run VOA and is now a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which houses VOA. After this weekend, though, it's not clear what will be left for Lake to run. For now, she says she's focused on slashing \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" at the broader agency.\n\n\"I would love to be in that position as director [of VOA], but I'm not. That falls on the current director, who was appointed during the Biden administration,\" said Lake. \"And if I were running VOA, I would do it differently than he's doing it, but it's up to him.\" That current director, Michael Abramowitz, apparently sees things differently, telling the journalist Mark Halperin that he considers himself \"a caretaker\" who is \"happy to be helpful to [Lake] as she takes on these responsibilities.\" Abramowitz said roughly 1,300 agency employees are on administrative leave, including himself, and he's unsure if VOA will \"survive.\"\n\nTrump's executive order , unveiled on Friday, orders the agency to cease operations \"to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\" The president can't unilaterally eliminate VOA, an 83-year-old organization whose charter was signed into law by former president Gerald Ford in 1976. But the blunt executive order is effectively a death warrant.\n\nA White House fact sheet accompanying the executive order cited an assortment of reports, including those published in the Free Beacon , detailing VOA's left-wing biases and sympathies toward Tehran. It also took aim at past VOA contributors with ties to the Kremlin, including a \"Russian anti-U.S. propagandist\" who produced \"videos with anti-U.S. and anti-Semitic themes.\"\n\nVOA's liberal leanings-which became particularly pronounced during Trump's first term in office-run counter to the broadcaster's stated mission to \"represent America\" and \"present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively.\" Instead, in many cases, it has advanced narratives preferred by America's adversaries and aligned itself with the anti-Trump left.\n\nVOA reporters, for example, are instructed to be \"fair, impartial and objective in all public spaces.\" In 2019, a collection of those reporters took to social media to trash the administration they were meant to highlight abroad.\n\nThis included Doug Bernard Johnson, a VOA editor, who maintained a Facebook page \"littered with anti-Trump posts,\" according to a Daily Caller report.\n\nMarissa Melton, a 23-year VOA veteran, repeatedly slammed Trump in several social media postings, including one that said, \"America [is] screaming 'GO AWAY.'\" Melton still lists herself as an \"international broadcaster\" for VOA on her LinkedIn page.\n\nA third VOA employee, Mil Arcega, described Trump as \"incoherent, unprepared, rude\" when he debated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential cycle. In another X posting from that time, Arcega responded to a post by Trump, saying, \"Lie much? You really should check your sources.\"\n\nUnder the Biden administration, meanwhile, USAGM in 2023 spent $23,500 in taxpayer funds to teach reporters under its wing how to be \"balanced and bias-free.\" The contract went to the Poynter Institute , a liberal journalism group that in 2019 released a \"blacklist\" of conservative news outlets, including the Free Beacon , which it deemed \"unreliable.\" Under criticism, Poynter withdrew the list, which was put together with its partners at the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center, which is notorious for labeling Christian conservative organizations as \"hate groups.\"\n\nPoynter is largely funded by wealthy Democratic donors, including George Soros, Pierre Omidyar, Craig Newmark, Bill Gates, and Tim Gill, an activist whose husband served as former president Joe Biden's ambassador to Switzerland. Its PolitiFact \"fact-checking\" arm overwhelmingly attacks conservatives, a Free Beacon analysis found , and has also had to make a number of embarrassing retractions, including retracting its outright dismissal of the theory that COVID originated from a Chinese lab leak as \"inaccurate and ridiculous.\"\n\nUSAGM also paid Poynter $20,100 in July 2021 to conduct at least four \"balanced and bias\" training sessions.\n\nVOA shifted further left during the so-called racial reckoning in the spring of 2020. The White House on Friday pointed to one article , published a few weeks after the death of George Floyd, titled \"What is White Privilege and Whom Does It Help?\"\n\nVOA, which is a tangle of different networks and partnerships around the world, many of which are not in English, has been accused of entrenched biases that extend far beyond U.S. domestic matters. Its Persian-language affiliate, which is supposed to beam unbiased news and American values into Iran, has been the subject of multiple congressional probes into pro-Iran bias and corruption. That affiliate, VOA's Persian News Network, which broadcasts out of Washington, is known to ban prominent Iranian regime critics and pursue stories that paint the hardline Islamist regime in a favorable light.\n\nIn 2022, Rep. Scott Perry (R., Pa.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, ordered the Persian News Network to turn over a litany of internal documents related to its Iran coverage and the rehiring of Setareh Derakhshesh Sieg, who was fired from VOA during Trump's first term in office over allegations she misappropriated nearly $1 million in funds and turned the outlet into a source of pro-Tehran propaganda. VOA rehired Sieg during the Biden-Harris administration even while she remained under congressional investigation.\n\n\"Over the past few decades, a lack of congressional oversight over the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) has allowed for partisan actors to obstruct the integrity and mission of the agency,\" Perry told the Free Beacon at the time. \"There's a lot of corruption that needs to be cleaned out immediately.\"\n\nPerry subsequently accused VOA of obstructing his probe, saying the outlet would not comply with orders to turn over information related to what he said was its partisan advocacy in favor of Biden and the misuse of a visa program to \"onboard foreign nationals.\"\n\nSeveral years earlier, a group of nearly 100 Iranian dissidents petitioned Congress to investigate VOA Persia, claiming it was complicit in \"clandestine efforts by the Islamic Republic to influence U.S. policy using a network of lobbyists and propaganda pieces placed in\" the outlet.\n\nTrump attempted to address the issue during his first term in office, implementing a series of \"serious reforms\" detailed in a 2020 Free Beacon report. USAGM and VOA largely resisted them until the Biden administration came into power.\n\nIn 2024, then-House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul (R., Texas) published a separate investigation into USAGM, VOA's Persian affiliate, and Sieg. That probe also determined VOA intentionally obstructed Congress and that its advocates even privately pleaded with McCaul to end the probe as his investigators began to uncover what he said was widespread misconduct at the organization's highest levels.\n\nSieg, McCaul's report found, was shielded from disciplinary action over allegations she \"abused taxpayer dollars for lavish personal trips and contracts for friends\" and made \"shifting claims\" about having a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne. McCaul also alleges that Sieg \"cultivated a culture of fear and dysfunction.\"\n\nWhen the Free Beacon published McCaul's report, VOA worked to discredit its findings. VOA executives allegedly threatened staffers who cooperated with congressional investigators.\n\n\"Unfortunately, when you have voices threatening VOA Persian whistleblowers, it makes talking more difficult,\" one staffer told the Free Beacon . Another added: \"We were all dumbfounded by our leadership's reaction to the report. It takes a lot of chutzpah to dismiss the report out of hand instead of judging it on its merits.\"\n\nAs the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks ignited Israel's war with Hamas, VOA engaged in similar behavior to that of private, anti-Israel, liberal news organizations such as CBS News. Top VOA editorial officials privately instructed staffers not to call Hamas and its members terrorists \"except when quoting statements,\" according to National Review .\n\nLake, whom Trump intends to install as VOA director sometime this year after Brent Bozell, the president's nominee to run the USAGM, is confirmed, described the editorial policy as \"shocking.\"\n\n\"When they're covering Oct. 7 and calling it, instead of a terrorist attack, an insurgence-they call them, instead of terrorists, insurgents, and insurgency rather than a terrorist attack,\" she told the Free Beacon . Speaking Monday night on Halperin's podcast , Abramowitz, the holdover director of VOA, blamed the internal Hamas directive on an editorial standards editor \"who's a very good editor\" but \"said something in an email to the staff which really didn't reflect what the official policy was, and that mistake has been killing us since then.\"\n\nAbramowitz said VOA reporters consistently refer to Hamas as a terrorist group and that \"Hamas are terrorists full stop.\"\n\nVOA also found itself in hot water internationally in 2022 when it published writings from a freelance journalist who was later arrested on suspicion of being a Russian spy. Pablo Gonzalez, a contributor to the outlet, was arrested in Poland on spy charges, prompting VOA to \"thoroughly review\" his articles.\n\nA second VOA reporter, Ilya Kolosov, was found in 2019 to have produced Russian propaganda videos that included anti-U.S. and anti-Semitic themes, according to the Daily Caller . Kolosov was employed as a \"contractor with the VOA Russian language service TV team,\" the outlet confirmed.\n\nAbramowitz, who has only been in charge of VOA for nine months, said the operation is a large and complex conglomerate of different media properties and affiliations and that a few inappropriate incidents have unfairly tarred the organization. But to Lake, VOA has fundamentally failed in its original mission.\n\n\"I know they talk a big game about being fair, but you could make an argument that they have not been living up to their charter,\" she said. \"Their charter means that we should be telling America's story abroad. And you could argue that in many cases, we have been telling the story of our adversaries rather than America.\"\n\nPublished under: Democrats , Iran , Israel , Kari Lake , National Security , Russia , trump , Voice of America\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Trump Backs One-Time Critic and Dem Donor in Crowded AZ Primary\n\nFormer president Donald Trump endorsed a one-time critic and Democratic donor in Arizona's crowded Republican gubernatorial primary.\n\nTrump on Tuesday announced his support of Kari Lake for Arizona governor, calling the former news anchor a \"fantastic person\" who will \"make ... the MAGA movement very proud.\" In 2017, however, Lake admonished Trump for his infamous press conference held after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Va. Lake told her Facebook followers the press conference marked \"a real $hit$h0w\" during which Trump \"showed absolutely no self-control.\"\n\n\"I'm fully aware that President Trump is an outsider to politics, but surely he can hold his tongue, not speak off-the-cuff and step all over his message,\" Lake wrote . \"It was like watching a train crash. ... Never thought I'd say this, Mr. President, if you can't control yourself, tweet, don't talk.\"\n\nGiven the former president's sensitivity to criticism when making endorsements, it is noteworthy for Trump to throw his weight behind a candidate who lambasted him over his rally response. Trump staunchly defended his remarks, which saw him place \"blame on both sides.\" Prior to the 2017 Trump Tower press conference, the then-president chastised the \"fake media\" for not being satisfied with his response. Lake worked as a TV anchor in Phoenix at the time.\n\nThe endorsement could propel Lake to the front of a crowded GOP primary field, which includes former congressman Matt Salmon and state treasurer Kimberly Yee. Lake has already sent a number of fundraising emails touting Trump's support, including one that called Trump \"the greatest president of my lifetime.\"\n\nTrump did not return a request for comment. Lake campaign spokesman Ross Trumble pointed to two statements Lake issued via Twitter.\n\nIn addition to Lake's 2017 Trump criticism, the Arizona gubernatorial hopeful has boosted Democrats in other elections. She donated to Democrats John Kerry and Barack Obama. Lake sparred with local reporters over the contributions during the opening weeks of her campaign, accusing one of conducting a \"hit piece interview.\"\n\nLake made her first ever political donation to Kerry in 2004, and she officially left the GOP two years later, changing her party affiliation to independent ahead of the 2006 midterms. Lake later registered as a Democrat in 2008 and held the affiliation for four years. She justified the contributions to Democrats by saying she \"thought the Republican Party had lost its way with the endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\" and \"was really excited about the first black president.\"\n\nLake entered the gubernatorial race in June as the \"only conservative, America First Trump Republican in the race.\" Prior to her run, Lake left her job as a Fox 10 Phoenix anchor due to what she called a lack of \"balance in coverage\" in \"every newsroom, at every level, and in each position.\"\n\n\"I found myself reading news copy that I didn't believe was fully truthful, or only told part of the story, and I began to fear that I was contributing to the fear and division in this country by continuing on in this profession,\" Lake said in March.\n\nPublished under: Arizona Governor , Kari Lake , trump\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Gallego Makes Last-Ditch Appeal to AZ Supreme Court to Keep Divorce Records Sealed\n\nArizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego on Tuesday sought the intervention of the state's Supreme Court to prevent the unsealing of his divorce records.\n\nLawyers for Gallego filed a motion to stay an appellate court decision that ordered the unsealing of the documents, arguing that \"sensitive details about the Gallegos' and their minor child's life stand to be published if Free Beacon succeeds\" and that the press and the public lose \"nothing\" by further delay, including a delay beyond the \"upcoming general election.\"\n\nTuesday's filing marks a last-bid effort by Gallego to keep his divorce records, which are treated as public documents for average Arizona citizens, under wraps.\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court does not have to rule, and if it takes no action, the records become public. Should it deny the motion, the records also become public.

      "text": "For GOP Senate Hopefuls at RNC, Every State Is a Border State\n\nMILWAUKEE-The capital cities of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Montana are all more than 1,000 miles from the southern border. That didn't stop those states' GOP Senate nominees from homing in on America's border crisis when they spoke at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, \"innocent young women like our daughters are being raped and murdered by illegal immigrants,\" Pennsylvania's Dave McCormick said. \"They are rolling out the red carpet for violent gangs, fentanyl, Chinese spies, individuals on the terror watch list,\" added Michigan's Mike Rogers. And when Montanans call for common sense, Tim Sheehy said, \"they want a secure border.\"\n\nSimilar rhetoric rang out from Arizona's Kari Lake, Wisconsin's Eric Hovde, Ohio's Bernie Moreno, and Virginia's Hung Cao, all of whom sought to tie their Democratic opponents to the Biden administration's border policies. Cao in particular fired up the crowd, contrasting his own immigration story-his parents fled communist Vietnam and he went on to serve as a Navy captain-with \"millions of illegal aliens\" who \"fly Hamas flags on our campuses\" and \"shout death to America.\"\n\n\"As an immigrant to this great country,\" Cao said, \"let me be very clear to everyone who comes here: don't ask for the American dream if you're not willing to follow American laws and embrace the American culture.\" The line received a standing ovation and chants of \"USA.\"\n\nThe southern border focus from the GOP's top Senate hopefuls-regardless of where they hail from-reflects the importance of the issue going into November.\n\nIllegal immigration is a weak spot for Biden, who has overseen the highest average level of annual illegal border crossings in American history. It's also surged to the number one issue for voters-in April, Americans named immigration as their top problem for the third month in a row, according to a Gallup poll . Before then, immigration had topped the poll only four times since 2000.\n\nThe issue's salience was clear Tuesday night in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Who's ready to retire Joe Biden and border czar Kamala Harris and send her back to California?\" McCormick said to open his speech. \"They have encouraged millions of illegals to invade America,\" Moreno said of Biden, Harris, and his opponent, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio). \"Gallego and the Democrats have handed over my state, Arizona's border, to the cartels,\" added Lake, referencing her own opponent, Democratic congressman Ruben Gallego.\n\nRogers, meanwhile, used his status as a former Army officer to say he's \"seen how dangerous the world can be.\"\n\n\"But in all my time working to protect America, I have never seen anything like the Biden-Harris open border policy,\" he said. \"It is long past time that we restore law and order.\"\n\nAs the speeches went on, the Biden campaign labeled former president Donald Trump a \"convicted felon,\" said he will provide \"tax handouts for billionaires and large corporations,\" and accused him of leaving Americans \"jobless\" during COVID.\n\nThe campaign did not, however, push back on the border rhetoric from the GOP Senate hopefuls, suggesting it does not see a way to counter Republicans on the issue. That vulnerability would almost certainly extend to Harris should she supplant Biden as the nominee.\n\nBiden tapped Harris to serve as his border czar in June 2021, and the vice president traveled to Guatemala to \"advance a comprehensive strategy to tackle the causes of migration\" two months later. While there, she told NBC's Lester Holt she had visited the southern border as vice president. She had not.\n\n\"At some point, you know, we are going to the border,\" she said. \"We've been to the border. So this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border. We've been to the border.\"\n\n\"You haven't been to the border,\" Holt responded. \"I, and I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris said before laughing. \"And I mean, I don't-I don't understand the point you're making.\"\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Border Crisis , Senate\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Victory: Court of Appeals Rules in Free Beacon's Favor, Orders Unsealing of Gallego Divorce Records\n\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled in favor of the Washington Free Beacon , upholding a Superior Court decision that ordered the partial unsealing of Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego's divorce records.\n\n\"Upon review, we hold the court properly exercised its discretion by narrowly tailoring what is to be withheld from public view for those legitimate purposes,\" the Court of Appeals wrote in its decision.\n\nFor nearly 10 months , the Gallegos have fought to shield the records-treated as public documents for the average Arizona citizen-from public view.\n\nGallego, who is running against Republican Kari Lake for Arizona's open Senate seat, filed for divorce in Yavapai County when his wife, Kate Gallego, was nine months pregnant. Neither party lived in the county at the time, though Arizona law stipulates that citizens must file for divorce in the county in which they reside, and the pair succeeded in convincing a judge to conceal even the case's existence on the docket.\n\nThree years after filing for divorce, and two years after the divorce was finalized, Gallego tied the knot with his second wife , lobbyist Sydney Barron, in a private ceremony in 2019.

Thank you Sydney for being my forever!\" Gallego wrote of his wife. The couple had a public wedding in 2021.\n\nSuperior Court judge John Napper ruled in July that the move was improper, and ordered the unsealing of the case with limited redactions, including for personally identifiable information. The Gallegos sought the intervention of an appellate court , which has now ruled against them. Absent the intervention of the Arizona Supreme Court, the file, with limited redactions, will become public on Oct. 17.\n\n\"The Gallegos had the burden to show continuing or new overriding circumstances to prohibit access to court documents or any portions thereof. They did not meet that burden,\" the Court of Appeals wrote Thursday. \"Given the applicable standard of review and the presumption that the court implicitly found all facts necessary to support its decision, we discern no error.\"\n\nPublished under: arizona senate , Ruben Gallego\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "The Road to a Republican Senate\n\nRepublican chances of winning control of the U.S. Senate improved Wednesday when a Washington Post poll showed Larry Hogan (R., Md.) trouncing his potential Democratic opponents by double digits. The popular former governor, known for his independence and common sense, has been supporting Israel as his Democratic rivals squabble for left-wing votes. Though Hogan remains the underdog to replace retiring Sen. Ben Cardin (D.), his successful record and unique profile will force Democrats to play defense in a blue state that they normally would be expected to win without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe Democrats have reason to be nervous. The 2024 Senate map endangers their 51-seat majority like no other recent election. Democrats hold most of the contested seats this year, including in states that Donald Trump won twice. They also hold all three seats that the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates as toss-ups. The most at-risk Republicans are Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Rick Scott (R., Fla.)-and their seats are both considered \"likely\" holds in red states.\n\nThe geography of this Senate cycle has always favored Republicans. But recently the number of potential GOP gains has increased, thanks to President Biden's dismal job approval and to candidates such as Hogan. The decline in split-ticket voting, with states backing the same party for president and Senate, helps Republicans, too. And so does the realignment of the electorate along class lines (as measured by educational attainment) rather than ethnicity and race.\n\nI divide the Senate races into three tiers: from the likeliest seats to turn red to outliers that could flip if everything goes the GOP's way. Here's my breakdown:\n\nTier One: West Virginia, Ohio, and Montana. These are the GOP's top targets. The seat in West Virginia, where Sen. Joe Manchin (D.) has announced his retirement, is practically guaranteed for Republican governor Jim Justice. Manchin is the sole statewide Democratic official in West Virginia, where Donald Trump won by around 40 points in 2016 and 2020. When Manchin retires, the state will complete its decades-long transition into a GOP stronghold.\n\nOhio pits incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D.), now in his third term, against Republican challenger Bernie Moreno. The Buckeye State car dealer, born in Colombia, ran roughshod over his opponents in Tuesday's GOP primary, beating his closest rival by 18 points. Moreno has the endorsement of Ohio's junior senator, J.D. Vance (R.), and of former president Trump. The national GOP has rallied behind him. Trump won Ohio by 8 points in both 2016 and 2020. And Vance was one of the few Senate GOP success stories in 2022, when he won by 6 points. Brown is a skilled politician. But he's swimming against the current in a state pulled by the red tide.\n\nMontana's incumbent senator, Jon Tester, is another talented Democrat serving his third term. His likely opponent is businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. I've admired Tester's personal affect and campaign skills since I covered his first Senate campaign , against GOP incumbent Conrad Burns, in 2006. And Tester has been able to thrive in a red state that voted for Trump by 20 points in 2016 and 17 points in 2020. But Sheehy, a newcomer backed by Montana Republican senator and Senate campaign chairman Steve Daines, will give him trouble. This is also the first time Tester and Trump have shared a ballot.\n\nTier Two: Nevada and Arizona . If Trump flips these two southwestern states in November, Democratic incumbents in Nevada and in Arizona could fall as well.\n\nNevada's Jacky Rosen (D.) keeps a low profile in Washington, but she defeated incumbent Republican Dean Heller handily in 2018 and is the sort of senator you'd expect to last in a state that hasn't voted for a GOP presidential nominee in 20 years.\n\nRosen's problem is that Nevada is changing. Trump lost the Silver State by 2 points in 2016 and 2020, but he has since overtaken Biden. Rising prices and a broken immigration system have pushed Hispanic voters toward Trump. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average , Trump is ahead of Biden by 4 points in Nevada. And his lead is consistent. The last poll that had Biden ahead was published in October. A Trump victory would boost likely GOP nominee Sam Brown, an Army veteran on his third attempt to win federal office.\n\nIn Arizona, the national GOP establishment coalesced around former television broadcaster Kari Lake. The MAGA celebrity, who lost a close race against Gov. Katie Hobbs in 2022, is the likely Republican nominee against Rep. Rubén Gallego (D.) to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I.). Lake will have to win over the Republicans and independents who were leery of her two years ago. She will also need Trump to defeat Biden in Arizona. At this writing, Trump is up by 5 points .\n\nTier Three: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. In 2016, Trump broke through the \"Blue Wall\" of Rust Belt states that hadn't voted for a Republican for president since 1988. That same year, Republican Senate candidates won in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. There was no Senate race in Michigan.\n\nTrump lost the Blue Wall states in 2020. Biden beat him by about 150,000 votes in Michigan, 80,000 in Pennsylvania, and 21,000 votes in Wisconsin. Michigan Senate candidate John James, now a Republican congressman, also lost by some 90,000 votes to incumbent Sen. Gary Peters. It stands to reason that if Trump climbs over the Blue Wall in 2024, then Republican Senate candidates in these three states will follow him on their way to D.C.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Trump leads Biden by 3 points in Michigan , where Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D.) is likely to face former congressman Mike Rogers (R.) in the fight to replace retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D.).\n\nTrump leads Biden by under 1 point in Pennsylvania, where GOP businessman and brilliant author Dave McCormick is running to unseat three-term Sen. Bob Casey Jr. (D.). And Trump leads Biden by 1 point in Wisconsin , where investor Eric Hovde is the likely Republican nominee against two-term incumbent Tammy Baldwin (D.).\n\nIf you add Larry Hogan to the mix, Republicans stand to win anywhere from one to nine seats in November. A GOP run could shift the balance of power in the Senate from 51-49 Democratic to 58-42 Republican. That would be the highest number of Republican senators since the 67th Congress, from 1921-1923, and the largest Senate majority of either party since the 111th Congress, from 2009-2011.\n\nBut a lot can-and will-go wrong. As it stands, Republican candidates in swing states are running behind Trump, closely trailing their Democratic opponents. Indeed, Justice and Hogan are the only two Senate candidates with leads outside the margin of error.\n\nThe closeness of the election is a reminder that Trump's lead, while persistent, is also narrow and precarious. It relies on independent voters continuing to prefer Trump to Biden, and on non-college minority voters showing up for Trump in November. If neither condition holds, then Trump's advantage may shift ever so slightly by Election Day, bringing a win for Biden and limiting GOP gains in the Senate.\n\nCandidate performance is another reason to be skeptical that Republicans will win all three tiers of Senate seats. We've been here before, most recently in 2022, when the GOP squandered opportunities by nominating individuals who mystified or scared the public. NRSC chief Daines has put a lot of work into candidate selection and training, and so far, his strategy appears successful. Yet all it takes is an errant word or a goofy moment or a general aura of weirdness to send independents and suburbanites back into the Democrats' arms.\n\nThe 2024 candidates have something the 2022 candidates did not: President Biden on the ballot. His deep unpopularity-the public's judgment that he is not up to another term-fuels Trump's comeback and Republican hopes. We're approaching the moment when Biden's problems will become insolvable. If Biden can't improve his numbers soon, Trump will return to office with a Republican Senate. One that includes Larry Hogan.\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Arizona Election , Donald Trump , Jacky Rosen , Jim Justice , Joe Biden , John James , Jon Tester , Kari Lake , Larry Hogan , Maryland Senate , Michigan Senate , Montana Senate , Nevada , Ohio Election , Pennsylvania Senate , Polls , Senate , Sherrod Brown , Steve Daines , tim sheehy , West Virginia , Wisconsin Senate\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
