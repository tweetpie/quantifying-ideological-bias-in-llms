      "text": "What Else Do Tucker Carlson's Unredacted Texts Reveal?\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nMedia Reporter\n\nThis reporting is featured in this week's edition of Confider , the newsletter pulling back the curtain on the media. Subscribe here and send your questions, tips, and complaints here .\n\nLate last week, we revealed previously unreported text exchanges between Tucker Carlson and \"straight news\" anchor Bret Baier shortly after the 2020 election, in which the pair schemed on how to win back pissed-off MAGA viewers.\n\nFox News doesn't want anyone seeing such texts, apparently, as they've now sent irate letters to Dominion lawyers demanding they put an end to the leaks of previously unreleased or redacted discovery material.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut we've got some more of those texts to share.\n\nIn the Tucker-Baier texts Confider reported , the pair worried Fox could be \"destroyed\" by the network's early but accurate Arizona call, with Carlson adding: \"I've got four more years here. I'm stuck with Fox. Got to do whatever I can to keep our numbers up and our viewers happy.\"\n\nBeing chained to Fox was apparently a common theme for Carlson, as newly revealed texts from less than a month later show him complaining about Trump's election-fraud lies hurting the right-wing cause: \"It's so sad. He's going to break some shit. He already is. Wish I knew where to run. But I'll die here.\"\n\nLike what you're reading? Subscribe to the Confider newsletter here and have The Daily Beast media team's stellar reporting sent straight to your inbox every Monday night.\n\nElsewhere in these unredacted texts, which Confider obtained and reviewed, Fox News star Jesse Watters expressed some very Tucker-like thoughts to Carlson about firing some news vets and replacing them with MAGA-friendly voices.\n\n\"Wallace Cavuto and other [ sic ] have got to go. Need some fresh blood. Should hire some trump people,\" Watters, who is seen as a likely heir apparent to Carlson's primetime throne, texted Tucker on Nov. 13. Watters' demand to fire veteran anchors Chris Wallace and Neil Cavuto mirror Carlson's similar, previously reported grousing to fellow primetime stars Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity.\n\nCarlson also let Watters know his anger towards correspondent Jacqui Heinrich, whom Carlson and Hannity also wanted fired for fact-checking a Trump tweet. \"This girl apparently works for us in the 'news' division, though I'd be stunned if she's ever broken a story,\" Carlson texted. \"She was on Twitter last night calling out Hannity, and accusing Trump of planning to 'steal' the election. Can't continue.\"\n\nThe then-primetime Fox star also maligned now-former Fox journalist Leland Vittert, telling Ingraham that the reporter's election coverage was \"like a BLM riot: the people who add nothing get to destroy everything.\" Despite the opinion hosts' desires at the time, Heinrich was promoted shortly after the 2020 election and Cavuto continues to anchor three programs across two networks.\n\nCarlson did not respond to a request for comment, while Fox News pointed to the letters it sent to Dominion last week complaining about media outlets obtaining more unredacted documents.\n\nSubscribe to the Confider newsletter here and have The Daily Beast media team's stellar reporting sent straight to your inbox every Monday night.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Suella Braverman's fate remains unclear as No 10 says internal inquiry ongoing - as it happpened\n\nThis live blog is now closed, you can read more on this story here\n\nAccording to Sky's Beth Rigby , some ministers think No 10 would be wrong to wait until the middle of next week before deciding Suella Braverman's fate.\n\nSenior minister: \"We can't continue like this\" \"No 10 may want to wait & see what happens at w/end & & poss wait for Supreme Court on Weds [Rwanda decision] But relationship with police is v damaged. Credibility generally is low. Delay makes the govt look weak unfortunately\"\n\nSenior minister: \"We can't continue like this\" \"No 10 may want to wait & see what happens at w/end & & poss wait for Supreme Court on Weds [Rwanda decision] But relationship with police is v damaged. Credibility generally is low. Delay makes the govt look weak unfortunately\"\n\nAccording to a report in the Times , Suella Braverman did agree to change some aspects of the article she wrote criticising the Metropolitan police at the request of Downing Street - but she also left in other aspects it wanted removed. The Times says:\n\nThe home secretary's aides submitted a draft of the article to No 10 on Wednesday. Officials came back that evening with a series of amendments, toning down some of the most incendiary claims.\n\nBraverman accepted some of the amendments, including removing a warning to the police not to take a \"soft touch\" approach at the Armistice Day protest, along with claims that there was \"ample evidence\" that senior police officers were biased. She also removed a direct reference to Sunak at No 10's request. But she rejected further changes, including suggestions that she remove the comparison to rallies in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\n\nThe paper also says Rishi Sunak will delay any decision about her fate until after Wednesday, when the supreme court will say whether or not the Rwanda deportation policy is legal. It reports:\n\nOne minister familiar with No 10's thinking said that Sunak's team would wait until after the Supreme Court publishes its judgment. They said: \"The bigger problem is the fact that we've got the Rwanda ruling next Wednesday. Surely people will want that to be finished before moving forward. You'd want to know the outcome of that before deciding what kind of home secretary you want going forward.\"\n\nSuella Braverman was seen leaving her home at around 10.15am, PA Media reports. She did not stop to speak to reporters at the scene.\n\nStephen Flynn , the SNP leader at Westminster, has described Suella Braverman as an \"incredibly nasty and vindictive politician\". Speaking on BBC's Good Morning Scotland this morning, he said Braverman had been trying to direct the police. He went on:\n\nThere's a big difference between scrutiny and seeking to give direction to the police.\n\nDirection which, as I understand it ... would break the law. This is a very dangerous moment and the home secretary really needs to go.\n\nHe also said his view of Braverman was well known.\n\nMy own view on Suella Braverman is well known.\n\nI think she's an incredibly nasty and vindictive politician, someone who attacks the most marginalised in society on a daily basis.\n\nThe UK economy flatlined between July and September, compared with the previous three months, as the impact of high interest rates and inflation weighed on consumers and businesses, Phillip Inman reports.\n\nNigel Farage , the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, also defended Suella Braverman on GB News last night. He said:\n\nI am absolutely certain that the centre of gravity on this in this country is actually right behind the home secretary.\n\nNow there are rumours swirling tonight around the bars and pubs in Westminster that a rapid reshuffle is on the way and that maybe Suella Braverman is on the way out.\n\nI like very much what Suella Braverman has to say, my disappointment is she never actually delivers any of it.\n\nFarage said he agreed with Braverman about the police being biased against rightwing protesters and in favour of groups like the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, and as evidence of that he cited the fact that some English Defence League marches proposed in east London were banned more than a decade ago.\n\nSuella Braverman seems to have GB News onside. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg , one of several Tory MPs paid to work as a presenter on the channel (Lee Anderson is another - see 9.08am ), backed her when he was on the channel last night, saying:\n\nThe home secretary has said what many people are thinking and the calls to sack her seem to be disproportionate because whether she's broken the ministerial code or not is something of a moot point ... she was talking about her own departmental area where she has direct responsibility.\n\nBut Rees-Mogg's endorsement was not unconditional. He said Braverman should be acting, not commentating.\n\nPeople expect the government to act not just commentate. At the moment the government seems to be unsure where it's going and this is leaving a vacuum that the police are unable to fill.\n\nThis echoes something that George Osborne , the former Tory chancellor, said on his Political Currency podcast yesterday. Osborne is at the opposite end of the Tory spectrum from Braverman and Rees-Mogg, and he suggested Rishi Sunak should sack the home secretary . But, quoting the election strategist Lynton Crosby, he said it was wrong for Braverman to act like a commentator. Osborne explained:\n\nThe home secretary is actually becoming a commentator when she should be acting as the home secretary.\n\nThere's a thing Lynton Crosby the Tory strategist used to say to David Cameron and me, 'don't be Connie the commentator!' That was the Australian phrase they used.\n\nHe says you're not the commentator on the situation, you're the prime minister, you're the chancellor, in this case, Suella Braverman is the home secretary.\n\nShe's got real decisions to make about how to support the police in their policing of demonstrations. She's got powers to override the police and ban demonstrations. She should be exuding all the authority of her office, rather than being yet another newspaper commentator, who is in some senses, demonstrating her powerlessness.\n\nThe Conservative MP Miriam Cates defended Suella Braverman on the Today programme this morning. She rejected claims that the home secretary was inflaming tensions and she said Braverman's claims about the police being biased in favour of leftwing protest groups like the Palestine Solidarity Campaign were perfectly reasonable. She said:\n\nI think the home secretary has a view that is very mainstream in the rest of the UK.\n\nCates is co-chair of a Tory group launched this year called the New Conservatives . Her co-chair is Danny Kruger, who was also on the Today programme, yesterday, defending Braverman. The group wants lower taxes, less immigration, and socially conservative, \"pro-family\" policies. It is not clear how powerful it is - only 14 supporters are listed on its website - but it has been getting a lot of positive coverage in Tory papers like the Daily Telegraph who love this stuff. Given the interventions of Cates and Kruger, it also looks as though it might function as Braverman's campaign base in a Tory leadership contest.\n\nBraverman might also get the backing of the European Research Group, the once-mighty pro-Brexit faction that she chaired at one point. But the ERG is much more marginal than it used to be. On the issues that matter now in Tory politics, the group is not united, and Brexiters are less keen to talk about the subject than they once were.\n\nIt has become normal for ministers giving interviews in recent weeks to start by failing to endorse something said by Suella Braverman , and Jeremy Hunt , the chancellor, and Rob Halfon , the skills minister, were both at it this morning.\n\nAsked about Braverman's most recent comments in the Times , Hunt said:\n\nAs many other cabinet ministers have said, the words that she used are not words that I myself would have used.\n\nBut I have a productive relationship with her as a colleague and I have always given her the money that she needs to fund police, bring down crime and to fund the immigration and asylum system.\n\nAsked if he would have been allowed to defy No 10 in the way Braverman did, Hunt went on:\n\nThe prime minister has said that he has full confidence in her. And I have nothing further to add.\n\nAnd Halfon , asked if he agreed with Braverman's anti-Met comments, told LBC:\n\nI think the home secretary has a unique way of expressing herself.\n\nAsked if he would have published an article without No 10 approval, he replied:\n\nNo I wouldn't. Everything I do in terms of articles and speeches must be signed off by No 10.\n\nGood morning. Since about 11.35am yesterday, when Downing Street decided to break the habit of a lifetime and give a direct answer to an awkward question, it has been clear that Suella Braverman's future as home secretary is on the line. Rishi Sunak is mulling over what to do about the fact that she published an article in the Times accusing the Metropolitan police of bias without No 10 approval. Arguably this was a breach of the ministerial code, and undoubtedly this was a provocative challenge to Sunak's authority. Braverman is a repeat offender in this regard, and many in the party are urging Sunak to sack her.\n\nBut since then not a lot has happened. Sunak is not a man for hasty decisions, and if there is a formal investigation into whether she broke the ministerial code, that might take a few days to complete. Braverman was in hospital yesterday with a relative having an operation, and that might hold things up a bit too. There are also two events in the diary that strengthen the case for delay.\n\nArmistice Day is tomorrow, and it would be easier to sack Braverman if the pro-Palestinian march passed off peacefully, vindicating the police and making it easier to say Braverman was scaremongering.\n\nAnd on Wednesday next week the supreme court will rule on whether the Rwanda deportation policy is legal. If the government loses, it will need a plan B, and Sunak is not enthusiastic about the one Braverman will propose: leaving the European convention on human rights. If the government wins, that will amount to arguably the biggest policy victory of Sunak's premiership. Even Tory MPs critical of Braverman may give her some credit.\n\nAll this is a roundabout way of saying, while it is not impossible that Braverman could be sacked today, it seems unlikely.\n\nAlthough the story has not moved on a lot since yesterday morning, one development worth noting is that Braverman's allies are mounting a fightback on her behalf. In Conservative politics the views of Tory papers count a lot (the same is not really true of leftish papers in Labour politics) and the Daily Mail splash headline could not have been better for Braverman if she had written it herself.\n\nMAIL: Come for Suella and you come for us all #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/QTjZAniLqq\n\nAnd here is an extract from the story by Jason Groves, Clarie Ellicott and David Barrett.\n\nOne MP ally of the Home Secretary said: 'There was an operation by the whips to stoke anger against Suella.\n\n'But a large group of MPs on the Right pushed back. The message was simple: 'Don't try it, she speaks for us. So if you come for her, you come for us'.'\n\nAnother said Mr Sunak 'owes her big time' for supporting him after Liz Truss resigned last year - a move that helped persuade Boris Johnson to abandon a potential comeback.\n\n'Without Suella it would have been Boris, not Rishi,' the source said. 'He owes her big time and although he might want to forget it, we haven't. If he tries to sack her it will end very badly for him.'\n\nAnd this is what Lee Anderson, a deputy chair of the Conservative party, has been tweeting this morning. He is placing loyalty to Braverman ahead of loyalty to Sunak who appointed him to his party post.\n\n@SuellaBraverman MP has NOT\n\nDescribed Hamas or Hezbollah as friends.\n\nNot took the knee on Whitehall whilst BLM riot.\n\nThese were the actions of MPs within the Labour Party, the same party who want her sacked.\n\nBut Suella is guilty.\n\nGuilty of saying what most of us are thinking and saying. Thank goodness we have a Home Secretary who refuses to be cancelled.\n\nShe is using everyday language used by everyday people. Labour MPs would know this if they got out more.\n\n@SuellaBraverman MP has NOT 👇👇 Described Hamas or Hezbollah as friends. Not took the knee on Whitehall whilst BLM riot. These were the actions of MPs within the Labour Party, the same party who want her sacked. But Suella is guilty. Guilty of saying what most of us are... pic.twitter.com/70paBZCGO3\n\nWe are getting a lobby briefing from No 10 at 11.30am. Otherwise, the diary looks quite empty. If I can find any other politics to cover, it will be here, but I expect the focus will mostly be on Braverman.\n\nIf you want to contact me, do try the \"send us a message\" feature.

      "text": "Entropy on the Left, Entropy on the Right\n\nManage your account\n\nFrom the G-File on The Dispatch\n\nI have a theory I want to walk you through.\n\nYou don't hear about the alt-right much anymore. I have several theories as to why. An obvious one is that it delegitimized itself. Trolling people on the internet with antisemitic cartoons and Pepe the Frog is not an agenda that lends itself to coalition-building at scale. The 2017 Charlottesville tiki torch march wasn't exactly a public relations coup, either. Smart people, whether antisemitic or not, recognized that being acolytes of neo-Nazis wasn't a great career move. Some alt-righters, I suspect, grew out of it, either because they realized the monumental dickishness of it or because it became boring as people learned to ignore it.\n\nSecond, the serious-largely unbigoted-intellectual types who apologized for, or played footsie with, the alt-right found more hospitable, serious, and reputable movements for their alternative right-wingery in things like the new nationalism, \"postliberalism,\" or simply Trumpism. That's what the term is supposed to mean, after all: an alternative to the contemporary right-wing \"establishment\" or consensus.\n\nAnd that gets to a third, less cheery, explanation for why we don't hear much about the alt-right anymore. It's not so \"alt\" as it once was. A lot of those young people found better career paths working for more \"establishment\" right-wing outfits. They're welcome in the MAGA-fied CPAC and Heritage Foundation, Turning Point USA, various chapters of the Young Republicans, and the new America First think tanks and astroturf-y outfits that have sprung up over the last decade, not to mention entry-level jobs on Capitol Hill, Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, and of course the GOP itself.\n\nI'm not saying it's all shot through with insipid bigots of the sort who think it's hilarious to photoshop people into gas chambers. Those people are still out there, but the actual alt-right is about more than meme warfare and how-many-Jews-can-you-fit-in-an-ashtray jokes now. The new hotness is about election denial, conspiracy theories, and in some cases, extreme Orbánism .\n\nWhat I'm saying is the broader alt-right-the one that thinks Ronald Reagan was terrible and William F. Buckley was a sellout-has had remarkable (though not total) success with its own short march through institutions. The relatively short journey of that march stems from the fact that few explicitly conservative institutions are wholly separate from the GOP and politics, so when the party goes Trumpy and MAGA, lots of institutions out of perceived necessity followed suit.\n\nThey didn't all reinvent themselves by any stretch, but they made room for folks with extremely unconventional views. Some institutions have resisted the tide to one extent or another, and plenty of individuals all over the right haven't had Damascene conversions to the new right. But what's clear is that within the GOP and nearly all the big-name conservative organizations, there's a new popular front, a new conception of a big tent, that to one extent or another considers everyone from, say, Candace Owens and Laura Loomer to Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gossar to Tucker Carlson and Michael Flynn to be part of \"the movement.\" People who \"punch right\" at such figures are considered bigger problems or more annoying heretics than the grifters, bigots, or whack jobs in the movement.\n\nDon't worry, I'm getting to my theory.\n\nIt's worth noting that there is no such thing as the \"alt-left.\" To the extent anyone used that phrase it was mostly as \"I'm rubber, you're glue ... \" deployed by the right as an epithet against woke types. But it never caught on. Moreover, pretty much no one unironically calls themselves \"alt-left.\"\n\nAnd why should they? The serious left largely succeeded in its long march through the institutions before I was born. Indeed, you could argue that, symbolically at least, their victory occurred the year I was born.\n\nIn 1969, Cornell University was torn apart by campus protests. The details - which are fascinating , by the way-are too complicated to get into here. But the basic story is that some African American radical students broke the rules while staging protests. Three of them were administratively punished. In response, black activists armed themselves with guns and occupied Willard Straight Hall. Chief among their demands was that the punishments be rescinded. Professors received death threats. Warning shots were fired into the engineering building. Thomas Jones, the ringleader, went on campus radio and, after reporting the home addresses of three professors-Allan Bloom, Clinton Rossiter, and Walter Berns-and four administrators, including Cornell President James Perkins, declared , \"Cornell has three hours to live.\"\n\nNot only were the punishments rescinded, but the school capitulated to wholesale changes in curriculum, staffing, and governance. Perkins resigned, and Bloom, Berns, legendary classics scholar Donald Kagan, and a young Thomas Sowell in his first teaching job, fled Cornell. A new university senate was created, the board was restructured, and the Africana Studies Research Center was founded. Rossiter, the great liberal historian, helped convince the faculty to keep the punishments. He told the New York Times , \"If the ship goes down, I'll go with it, as long as it represents reason and order. But if it's converted to threats and fear, I'll leave it and take a job as a night watchman in a bakery.\"\n\nHe then switched positions. The faculty senate, which had rejected the demands for clemency just days earlier, reversed itself. Bloom would later recall that \"students discovered that pompous teachers who catechized them about academic freedom could, with a little shove, be made into dancing bears.\"\n\nJones went on to be the head of the TIAA, the pension fund for most college professors. (I once heard Berns marvel at the fact that the kid who threatened to kill him now handled his pension fund.)\n\nI bring this up because I think it's illustrative of the mainstream left's orientation toward the far left. Universities today are full of academics and administrators who ideologically and psychologically think the Cornell crisis was a big win for social justice. You can see the same dynamic in how groups like the Weathermen and the Black Panthers are remembered. Even when violence isn't involved, left-wing radicalism is seen as something to be admired by mainstream liberals. The radical will, the authenticity, the passion, is seen as a driver of progress. Radical chic is cool. Moreover, the radical left has the courage of its convictions, while the Rossiter-style liberals lack a similar conviction to defend \"reason and order\" when required. People who keep their youthful radicalism are hailed for not \"selling out.\"\n\nAmong mainstream journalists and progressive academics and intellectuals generally, radical indictments of America's liberal order are seen as bold and admirable. The radical intellectuals-Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, Frantz Fanon, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Stanley Fish, et al.-are (or were) bravely and nobly speaking \"truth to power.\" Never mind that they are as anti-liberal as anybody among today's New Right.\n\nI think much of this started with communism and what became mainstream liberalism's \"anti-anti-communism.\" The last gasp of serious anti-communist bravery among the left, of the sort Rossiter could not muster, was Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). Arthur Schlesinger and his fellow \"vital center\" liberals recognized communists -I mean real, Soviet-aligned communists in America-were an existential threat to the American project. As Joseph and Stewart Alsop had written in the New Republic in 1946, \"the liberal movement is now engaged in sowing the seeds of its own destruction.\" Liberals, they argued, \"consistently avoided the great political reality of the present: the Soviet challenge to the West.\" This realization led to the creation of the ADA the next year. They successfully purged the Democratic Party of Communists, who moved en masse into the Progressive Party.\n\nBut starting in the 1950s, mainstream liberalism embraced intellectual and political popular frontism. Being a victim of McCarthyism-or simply anti-communism-was a badge of honor. The former radicals and communists who became actual conservatives, willing to defend American liberal institutions, were the real enemy. When the socialist writer Michael Harrington called them \"neoconservatives\" the association with neo-Nazism was deliberate.\n\nObviously, I'm offering the briefest sketch of a complicated story, but I think my sketch recognizably captures reality pretty well.\n\nThe upshot is that mainstream \"liberal\" institutions lack the ability to recognize illiberalism on their own side. Speech codes and the like are for policing them not us. Moral norms about condemning antisemitism or appeals to racial solidarity only apply to forces outside the tent. Horror at theocracy isn't aimed at theocracy per se, but at Catholics and \"Christian extremists.\" Muslims who call for Islamic supremacy are merely part of the beautiful mosaic of diversity. Having a problem with that isn't honorable, classically liberal, Jeffersonian revulsion at theocracy, it's \"Islamophobia.\" Discrimination against Asians or Jews is in service to diversity. Discrimination-real or alleged-against blacks is consistent with America's innate racism. Crackpots-like Naomi Wolf, Michael Moore, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-were only deemed crackpots when they proved inconvenient or adversarial to the progressive popular front.\n\nIn his great cover essay for Commentary , \" The Woke Jihad ,\" Abe Greenwald makes the sadly obvious observation that the mainstream institutions of the left have a massive problem with antisemitic radicalism. If you were paying attention after October 7, you might have been surprised by the number of people in reputable positions at reputable institutions openly happy about a heinous terror attack on Jewish civilians. An even larger number of reputable people at reputable institutions were-and remain-apologists for those people. Abe does all the legwork providing examples and explanations about the popular frontism of the radical left and Islamists. But even his ample provision of examples is but a dollop from a very deep and wide well.\n\nI could easily provide countless more examples of journalists, academics, authors, and artists who either traffic in antisemitism, support of terrorism, or the broader ideology of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism. Much of it has taken on the spirit of a McCarthyite moral panic. Read Jamie Kirchick's essay on anti-Zionism in the literary world and tell me I'm wrong.\n\nBear in mind that October 7 did not create any of this, it revealed it. A terrorist attack in which young peaceniks were gang raped and children were burned alive would be a weird provocation for making people antisemitic. No, October 7, revealed something that had been building for a very long time. If I were to describe the views of many leftist antisemites without providing any hints to what team they came from, many thoughtful liberals would assume I was describing the alt-right. But what I would be describing is what should be considered the \"alt-left\"-but isn't.\n\nMeanwhile, it's worth noting that the post-Cold War right developed all sorts of mechanisms, norms, rules, and arguments for keeping radicals out of its institutions. The reasons for this are complicated. Some of it was deeply principled. Some of it was born of practical necessity, given that conservatives were under constant surveillance by the liberal-dominated media and academia. Flirting with radicalism, racism, or antisemitism threatened to delegitimize the conservative project. By no means was the right flawless in its execution of these rules. William F. Buckley took too long to change his views on race-but he did change them. He was quicker and more courageous about antisemitism and crackpottery, purging everyone from Ayn Rand (a little unfairly), the Birchers, and even his friends Pat Buchanan and Joseph Sobran. There was a reason cranks like Ron Paul had to make do with crappy direct-mail newsletters.\n\nIt's very hard to find a similar, institutionalized, system on the left. For instance, Caitlin Flanagan, writing in 2022 , noted the strange way the literary world cannot bring itself to truly acknowledge, never mind condemn, Alice Walker's flagrant Jew hatred.\n\nAlice Walker is a literary giant. Joseph Sobran, a brilliant longtime writer for National Review , was not. But Buckley looked at his friend and colleague's antisemitic writings (which had degenerated over the course of his career) and came to the painful and correct conclusion he had to go. Who on the left, with similar standing as Buckley had on the right, would dare to cancel the author of The Color Purple ?\n\nAnd so here, finally, is my theory. I think the right is becoming like the left because it has abandoned the will and desire to police itself. Conservatism has reached a size and scale that it no longer worries about being condemned by the left. Indeed, it takes such condemnations to be compliments, proof that it's doing something right. I've lost count of the number of times I've heard prominent right-wingers claim that the flak they're taking from \"the left\" is proof they are \"over the target.\" Popular frontism is the order of the day. The apologists for January 6 are Clinton Rossiters of the right. Getting prominent Republicans to condemn rightwing goons and thugs is as difficult as getting Democrats to denounce rioters and Antifa during the BLM riot days. Not impossible, but much, much, harder than it should be.In the same way that drawing fire from the right \"proved\" that radical leftists were speaking truth to power, drawing fire from the left is a badge of honor on the right. Lost in this pas de deux of radical horseshittery is the fact that actually defending classically liberal norms and institutions doesn't pay. Progressive elites are terrified of being in bad odor with the radicals on their team, and conservative elites feel the same way about theirs. Progressives who \"punch left\" and conservatives who \"punch right\" are traitors and sell-outs. The radicals share a common animosity toward the constitutional order and any institution that doesn't join their side. They also share all sorts of other views-identitarianism, corporatism, protectionism, and either outright antisemitism or a tolerance of it in their ranks. All they really disagree on is who should be in power, and who should benefit from it.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch\n\nThe Dispatch is a new digital media company providing engaged citizens with fact-based reporting and commentary, informed by conservative principles.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) spent the third anniversary of the January 6 riot at the Capitol attacking the civil unrest during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests.\n\nIn a series of posts shared on X, formerly Twitter , Greene hit out at BLM protesters and rioters under the guise that videos in the thread were from January 6.\n\nVideos and photos of looting and fires engulfing buildings and vehicles were instead purportedly taken and shot during the 2020 civil unrest that swept across the U.S. following the murder of George Floyd .\n\nOn January 6, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress met to formalize the victory of then President-elect Joe Biden . The Republican had called his supporters to Washington D.C. to support his unsubstantiated claim that the 2020 election had somehow been stolen.\n\nFloyd was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin after he was suspected of using a counterfeit $20 bill on May 25, 2020. His death triggered a wave of protests and civil unrest around the issue of police brutality towards Black people.\n\nNewsweek has not been able to verify the origin of many of the videos shared in Greene's thread.\n\nThe aftermath of January 6, 2021. pic.twitter.com/K3rKxmo2ge\n\n\"Wait...that was also from the 'Summer of Love' BLM riots when they decided to burn down our nation's capital. Here's more images from D.C.,\" Greene said.\n\nWhile Newsweek has not been able to verify the origin of many of the videos and photos shared on Greene's thread, it is true there were fires during protests in the nation's capital during the BLM protests in 2020.\n\nGreene has staunchly defended the January 6 defendants and has previously compared their criminal prosecutions to her claims of a lack of action taken against BLM protesters .\n\nAccording to an Associated Press tally shared on June 3, 2020, just days after George Floyd's murder, an estimated 9,300 people had been arrested in connection with protests over his killing.\n\nIn comparison, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said more than 1,265 defendants have been charged in connection with the January 6 riot at the Capitol. Approximately 718 individuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges.\n\nPatriotic pretrial J6 defendants are rotting away in jail, many being held in solitary confinement, and Joe Biden brags about it! Meanwhile, most BLM rioters who caused billions of $'s in damages and set our country on fire haven't spent a single day in jail. pic.twitter.com/jLbgvvCwMW\n\nGreene also directly hit out at President Joe Biden , who denounced the riot at the Capitol and mentioned the arrests during his first campaign speech in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania , on Friday.\n\nShe then included the heavily criticized \"fiery but mostly peaceful\" caption CNN ran while national correspondent Omar Jimenez reported from Kenosha, Wisconsin, as vehicles burned behind him during BLM protests.\n\nThe media loves to propagandize the events of J6 to villainize peaceful Trump supporters. The same media who declared the BLM riots \"Fiery but Mostly Peaceful\" as Kenosha, WI burned during just one night of \"protests.\" pic.twitter.com/7l2S2Xz7iA\n\n\"Patriotic pretrial J6 defendants are rotting away in jail, many being held in solitary confinement, and Joe Biden brags about it\", Greene said.\n\n\"Meanwhile, most BLM rioters who caused billions of $'s (dollars) in damages and set our country on fire haven't spent a single day in jail.\"\n\n\"The media loves to propagandize the events of J6 to villainize peaceful Trump supporters.

In comparison, 30 percent of independents and 13 percent of Democrats held this view.\n\nThe poll was conducted between December 14 and 18 among a national sample of 1,024 American adults and has an error margin of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points for the full sample.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAnders Anglesey is a U.S. News Reporter based in London, U.K., covering crime, politics, online extremism and trending stories.

      "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris will formally accept her party's 2024 presidential nomination next week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Kamala is an utter radical-a true, dyed-in-the-wool leftist. As I put it in my most recent syndicated column : \"Harris, intellectually challenged and an empty vessel for Democrats to project their basest desires, is the unique politician to find herself at the tripartite Venn diagram of all three Democratic Street Thuggery movements. The overlap of 'believe all women'-style destructive feminism, Antifa-BLM 'racial reckoning' anarchy, and Hamas/Hezbollah flag-flying civilizational jihad is embodied in one person: Kamala Harris.\"\n\nBut that radical record-and the nearly-equal radical record of Harris's Communist China-honeymooning, BLM riot-abetting running mate, the prairie socialist Tim Walz of Minnesota-has largely escaped public scrutiny thus far. On the one hand, that is simply shocking-Kamala Harris is literally running for president of the United States , following her bloodless coup of her putative octogenarian boss, and We the People have no idea what she purports to believe with respect to virtually any of the leading issues affecting our lives! On the other hand, it is amazing what a Democratic candidate can get away with when he/she has a deeply biased corporate media doing everything it can to shield that candidate from having to answer to the public. Thus, we have the present spectacle of Kamala Harris not answering a single meaningful question from the press for three and a half weeks (and counting). After pretending to be real journalists for a few weeks, the Washington press corps immediately returned to form after Kamala successfully coup'ed Joe.\n\nUltimately, as the ancient Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu taught thousands of years ago: Before a battle even begins, it is won by choosing the terrain on which it will be fought. And so it will be with the 2024 presidential election as well. If Republicans can ensure the election is contested on the terrain of the leading substantive issues facing the American people-on the economy (as I recently discussed on my show with Charles Gasparino) , immigration, and crime, above all-then they should prevail. But if the election becomes a subjective \"vibes\" competition or a mere high school-like popularity contest, the GOP could very well lose.\n\nTo keep up with everything I'm doing and all my various media hits, make sure to follow me on Twitter/X , Instagram , and Facebook .

We'll see you next week!\n\nOn Jan. 21, 2017, hundreds of thousands of feminists wearing pink \"pussyhats\" protested the prior day's presidential inauguration of Donald Trump by rampaging throughout Washington, D.C. The \"Women's March on Washington,\" an extension of the riots and protests that shook the capital on Inauguration Day itself, was not exactly a peaceful affair. Hundreds of anarchists in total were arrested over the multi-day period, typically on rioting or vandalism charges. The \"pussyhat\"-clad feminist rioters thus constituted the first Trump-era manifestation of destructive Democratic shock troops. Call it Democratic Street Thuggery 1.0.\n\nThat particularly virulent strain of radical feminism reached a crescendo during the #MeToo societal struggle session of 2017-2018, culminating in the infamous Christine Blasey Ford-led attempt to derail Brett Kavanaugh's U.S. Supreme Court nomination in Sept. 2018. Arguably the single leading misandrist crusader during that sordid affair, peddling the ludicrous \"believe all women\" smear from her senatorial dais and casually throwing out five millennia of \"innocent until proven guilty\" civilizational norms in the process, was none other than dimwitted California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nAlas, Joe Biden-or what little remained, even back then, of Joe Biden-was so awestruck by Harris' vile interrogation of Kavanaugh and her own hilariously unimpressive 2020 presidential campaign that he tapped her to be his running mate. Cackling Kamala's grand contribution to the Biden campaign was to dutifully launder her own swarthy complexion to \"empathize\" with left-wing America during our next great struggle session, the Antifa-Black Lives Matter \"racial reckoning\" that followed the May 2020 death of St. George Floyd our Martyr. Such \"empathy\" included Kamala's unctuous rhetorical support for the rioters, as well as her posting to social media a link to support bail for those rare BLM rioters who were actually arrested. The Antifa-BLM rioters, who caused up to $2 billion in property damage during that infamous Summer of Love, constituted Democratic Street Thuggery 2.0.\n\nListen to the latest episode of The Josh Hammer Show Here\n\nNewsweek Site | See All Newsletters\n\nPlease send your feedback and ideas to j.hammer@newsweek.com\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"
