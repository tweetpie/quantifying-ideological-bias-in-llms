      "text": "DEI exposes the myth of white male superiority - and that's why they hate it\n\nA protester holds a sign saying \"Trump wins\" at a rally in support of U.S. President Donald Trump at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem, Oregon, U.S. January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump and his white male supremacist buddies in government and rightwing media have been playing our legacy media and the American people for suckers. And it's working.\n\n\" Big Balls \" and his openly racist buddies at DOGE have been, according to reports in the media, scouring federal agencies for \" illegal DEI \" programs. Meanwhile, rightwing radio hosts are speculating whether the Delta Airlines crash in Toronto this week was the result of a female or Black \"DEI hire\" pilot flying the plane because Delta has refused to kill off its own DEI programs.\n\nThe explicit and implicit message Trump, Musk, and their goon squad have been promoting is that when a woman or Black, disabled, or Hispanic man is hired they are inherently inferior in their intellect and capabilities to the white man from whom that job was taken.\n\nIt's an evil lie.\n\nAnd every time it gets promoted by Trump, Musk, or the media every woman or Black pilot, manager, doctor, or any other position historically filled by white men can feel white people looking at them and wondering if they're an \"inferior\" person hired just because of their gender or the color of their skin.\n\nHow'd we get here?\n\nFor most of my lifetime, white men have enjoyed a \"Mad Men\" privileged status when it comes to employment. Part of it was because - after centuries of legal discrimination - Blacks and women were less likely to own businesses or be in management positions to hire staff.\n\nIt's a natural human instinct to want to surround oneself with people who're consider simpatico; people who look, think, and talk like you do. Thus, white men doing hiring had a built-in bias (sometimes unconscious) to hire other white men. Similarly, many hiring choices are made without even posting job offers because the person doing the hiring \"knows someone\" who'd be able to do the job.\n\nThere's also the reality of conscious and unconscious bias that tends to keep mostly male and white workplaces that way, and the result of that is that most white Americans' default assumption is that white people are generally the most competent. After all, look at all those white people who have all those great jobs!\n\nStepping into this reality, people of good conscience have spent the past half-century trying to work out ways to break up the \"old white boy network\" of hiring and promotions, to allow highly qualified women and Black men (among others) to have equal, merit-based job opportunities.\n\nStarting as the Civil Rights movement, followed by the 1980s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs, a clear effort to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace took form in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIt was never meant to elevate incompetent women and Black people into positions above their ability; instead, it was designed to prevent incompetent white men from getting jobs for which there are more competent women or Black people.\n\nIn other words, by definition \"DEI hires\" are the most qualified people available, regardless of their race or gender. DEI programs are almost universally meritocratic; their goal is to simply open the hiring door to a wider variety of people beyond just white men.\n\nBut you won't hear that from openly racist rightwing media and Republican politicians; they're committed to convincing white men that their jobs suck because women and Black people took the \"good jobs,\" rather than that 45 years of Reaganism/neoliberalism gutted America's manufacturing base and destroyed our unions.\n\nThus, when Musk and Trump and their people talk about DEI, what they're really saying is that women and Black people (among others) are simply inferior to white men, and a giant conspiracy/system - DEI - is handing these inferior people jobs that rightfully belong to white men.\n\nProbably the most disgusting part of this entire charade is how the media goes along with Republicans in this racist, misogynist framing of the issue.\n\nFor example, have you ever heard a media commentator, when discussing DEI and the Trump/Musk apartheid war against it, point out that DEI generally guarantees the most qualified people get the job? Have you ever heard them explain that DEI is really just about opening the pool of job candidates to a wider cross-section of Americans?\n\nI haven't.\n\nI hear them discuss DEI and \"DEI hires\" as if Trump was right when he knew a woman had piloted the helicopter that crashed into a plane over the Potomac and then blamed it on DEI. As if that woman must be less qualified than the white man who wasn't piloting the chopper.\n\nAnd that's a racist, sexist lie. Why can't the media just say that?\n\nThere's no more vivid example of white people and men getting hiring preferences over more highly qualified women or minorities than Trump's cabinet nominees: case in point Pete Hegseth.\n\nOur Secretary of Defense lost no time at stopping the military from recruiting at girls' schools and the Black Engineer of the Year Awards: he only wants white men as incompetent, alcoholic, and into womanizing as himself in his White Men's Military.\n\nThe reality is that Trump and Musk are all about DEI hires, using their twisted definition of the term. Musk's team appears to be entirely white and male, as are most of the people Trump surrounds himself with. One could argue, in that context, that DEI stands for \"Don, Eric, and Ivanka.\"\n\nLet's just tell the truth. Trump's anti-DEI policy is about white and male supremacy. Trump's immigration deportation policy is about white supremacy. And Trump's assertion that he knows \"what the law is\" and is above the law is about white billionaire supremacy.\n\nAs Delta Airlines knows, DEI hiring - by opening wider the gates through which job applicants can come - insures the best and the brightest become Delta pilots, flight attendants, engineers, etc.\n\nRepublicans and rightwing media will complain all day long that air crashes and every other problem are caused by women and Black people being hired into jobs that were historically filled by white men.\n\nBut it's always been a racist, sexist lie and still is today. And the media should have the courage to say so.\n\nPass it on.\n\nNow Read: Experiencing rage and fear? This is for you."

      "text": "'You don't belong': White man threatens black teen in front of her home in gated community\n\nTensions are high in the country. We are in the middle of a historic pandemic, our economy is going down the drain, our federal government is being dominated by a truly incompetent and cruel narcissist, and the racism and inequalities in our society have never been more transparent. But let's be clear: the incidents of law enforcement, of \"Karens,\" and of white folks mistreating their Black neighbors are not new to this moment in time. We just have more personal recording equipment and easier ways of disseminating that information than we have ever had before.\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach Post , Breonna Nelson-Hicks, 15, was riding around in a golf cart with other teenaged friends in her Wellington, Florida, neighborhood. In a police report, Nelson-Hicks said an unidentified middle-aged white man driving a Toyota sedan began following the group of teenagers. The man began very deliberately tail-gaiting the group and, according to Breonna, her group pulled over to the side in order to let the man pass. But it seems that man didn't want to pass.\n\nAccording to the report, when they stopped and the man in the car continued to just sit behind them, the boys in the group jumped out and ran while the three female teens began walking back toward Breonna's home, where her grandfather was. Breonna is Black and her two friends are white, according to the Palm Beach Post. When the teens got close to the home the man reportedly began yelling at them, then stopped his car and got out to continue yelling at them. This is when one of the young women began recording the incident on her phone.\n\nIn the video, which you can watch below, the man menacingly tells the teens that they \"don't belong in this development,\" to which the teens reply that they do, and that they live there. The man demands to know their name and where they live. \"Why would I tell you any of this?\" says one of the girls. The man threatens to have them arrested, and the girls say fine: \"What did we even do wrong?\" The man seems to walk toward a neighbor, who has come out of her driveway from across the street. He tells the neighbor that he \"had to wait five minutes while they were strutting around the road.\"\n\nIt is at this point in the video that the girls involved make that sound of exasperation one makes when someone is gaslighting you. They begin explaining that they were attempting to back up out of his way in order to let him pass, but he clearly wouldn't allow that. Breonna then can be seen walking into the frame, telling the man that she could go get her grandfather now. The man is all bluster, saying \"Get him right now.\" The neighbor across the street tells the two girls still filming to just not argue with this guy: \"It's not worth it,\" she says. Then the man tells them that they are driving illegally, and the girls ask why he was trying to hit 15-year-old girls with his car.\n\n\"Because you're 15 years old? You could marry legally in Mississippi or Alabama.\" I'm sorry. Wow. WTF??? The young woman recording replies, \"This is not Mississippi or Alabama, it's Florida.\" It is at this point that Breonna's grandfather, 62-year-old Tony Nelson, comes out of the home. The unidentified man lifts his hand to say \"Sir,\" and Nelson replies \"Don't stick your hand out. Did you threaten a child?\" The man denies this, and the teens say they have it on video, and Nelson tells the teens to go inside and show him the video.\n\nNelson told the Post that Breonna was hysterical when she came through the door to tell him what was happening outside. Nelson says that after the teens stopped recording he continued to talk with the unidentified man. The man attempted to defend his actions and \"spoke about apologizing to the teens,\" but Nelson knew that the damage was already done.\n\nHe called the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office to file a report. Nelson says the deputies who then arrived were cordial and seemed sympathetic when watching the video. The man had left and was interviewed the following day but no charges were filed, as the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office says that \"Based on both accounts no crime was committed.\"\n\nNelson says that Breonna grew up in that community. He says that he became angrier and angrier after the deputies left his home, thinking about how wretched a situation this was. He says he watched the video numerous times after and spoke out about this incident because he felt compelled to: \"Shame on me if I just walk away because normally I have a comfortable life.\"\n\nListen, if you aren't a teen, teens can be super annoying. They are just developing their egos and they are frequently loud and self-absorbed. They play music you don't get or don't like, and they say things that an older version of them would be embarrassed to hear them say. We were all those kids once. But being an adult who tried to bully a bunch of kids that don't seem to have been doing much of anything except driving about in a golf cart is strange, and when you add the implication that someone doesn't belong somewhere solely because of their race or how they look, you are exposing yourself for not simply being an ornery old fool, but something angrier and more ugly and potentially dangerous.\n\nThere has been speculation and unsubstantiated reports that the unidentified Wellington resident is an employee of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and that he works in Citizenship and Immigration Services in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of this story, there has been no official sourcing or identification of the man in the video. Would it be surprising to find that a person employed by our current DHS was kind of a bullying racist who was also a crappy person? No. But the United States has a lot of positions being filled with that personality type right now, and always has."

      "text": "Dirty white boys: Why the racist GOP made dismantling these initiatives their No. 1 target\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) reacts as U.S. President Donald Trump delivers his inaugural address on the day of his Presidential Inauguration at the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., January 20, 2025.\n\nThis is beyond horrid.\"\n\nThose four words were spoken from an old colleague of mine who now works under constant threat inside the Department of Interior. They illustrate better than I can in 1,000 words what we are watching right now as a racist, America-attacking, convicted felon puffs out his blubbery chest and takes a sledgehammer to our government to appease the billionaire oligarchy who are leading him around by his stuffy nose.\n\nThe tough guy from the yacht clubs of New York, is going full Mussolini while he saves America from all the pain he and his white collar gangs on Wall Street have inflicted on the working class for decades.\n\nLet's not confuse what is really going on here, people ...\n\nEnd of the day, this is nothing but a grotesque attack on the poor, and many of the programs that have been put in place to help, shelter, feed, and just give them a little hope that is there is something better. Because if you can take a person's hope and dignity away, you can hope they'll just go away, too.\n\nThat's how losers win, and democracies crumble.\n\nDefenseless human beings in Red and Blue States are being scapegoated and blamed for what allegedly ails us, so the broken-heartless in America can feel superior about themselves after coming home from a job each day that never loves or pays them near enough. But, hey, at least while they're groveling for an extra 50 cents an hour, and a few days of paid vacation, they can crack open a cold one, crank up Fox News, and look down on the \"lesser\" from their perch in some gutter.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson described it best to then-White House staffer Bill Moyers after encountering overt racism during a trip to Tennessee after the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964:\n\n\"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.\"\n\nAnd because Trump , who banged a porn star just weeks after his third wife gave birth to their only child, knows a thing or two about hurting people - I mean REALLY hurting them - he's going hard after DEI programs that help good people and hurt complete lowlifes like him.\n\nYou see, by their rancid telling, long before we were ever a country, people of color have always been the problem here ...\n\nThere's absolutely nothing new in this repulsive, political play, because by definition the orange, little-fingered thug represents the Grand Old Party.\n\nSo let's slam everything into reverse, and drill, baby, drill ...\n\nI typed all of this as a warning and a pretext for what's coming next: A defense of DEI, and why it is absolutely vital we carry on with its worthy mission.\n\nThere's a reason it is No. 1 on the mad king's chopping block: Nothing threatens him more than an engaged, motivated, informed and diverse electorate.\n\nThere was a time I wasn't fully convinced of the absolute need for DEI initiatives. I wrote about some of this a couple of years ago, so I apologize if you've come across it before.\n\nThe year was 2000. Bill Clinton was wrapping up his last year of the presidency, and looking back, it seems like we were in the final months of what passed for normalcy in America. The contentious Gore-Bush election was just around the corner (which was ironically and tragically decided by a Conservative Supreme Court), to be closely followed by 9/11, the Iraq War, the Great Recession, unhinged vitriol by the Right over President Obama's tan suit, and finally ending with the election (and reelection) of a stone-cold traitor ...\n\nIn the spring of that year, I was privileged to represent Stars & Stripes newspaper at American Society of Newspaper Editors Annual Managing Editors Conference in Reston, Virginia.\n\nI had been with Stripes for nearly two years and had recently been promoted to managing editor of the important, editorially independent newspaper that serves our troops and their families overseas.\n\nI was surrounded by my peers representing daily newspapers from Minneapolis to St. Louis, and from San Antonio to Denver. I reckon there were about 35 or 40 of us MEs at this thing, but it's been long enough now that I can't remember for sure.\n\nFor some reason I can, however, vividly recall looking at the schedule they handed us for the week while battling with a coffee and donut that first morning. On the afternoon of the fourth day we'd be talking about \"Diversity in the Newsroom. \"\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" I mumbled to myself. \"This is when we're gonna catch hell from some well-paid, uninformed \"expert\" for failing to have enough diversity in our newsrooms. Can't wait ...\"\n\nBefore I tell you what happened in that session, and how it radically changed my thinking on the subject, I want to stop right here very quickly and pat myself on the back just a tiny bit.\n\nAt the time of this conference, I had 10 assistant managers reporting to me in the newsroom. Here was the makeup of these managers:\n\nI'm not saying that I was staffing up the United Nations, but I am saying I worked with real intention to make sure my newsroom didn't look like White Man's Appreciation Day at the country club.\n\nThe overall makeup of our newsroom admittedly wasn't as diverse, because getting and then keeping diverse journalists was a real challenge.\n\nBecause we were located in the National Press Building in downtown Washington, D.C., we were surrounded by two huge national newspapers: The Washington Post and USA Today .\n\nJust as quickly as we were hiring and training up diverse talent, those papers were poaching them away from us. They, too, had diversity initiatives in place, and far bigger budgets at their disposal to lure away ambitious newspaper people from mid-sized papers like Stripes .\n\nWhile it was a backhanded compliment that these newspapers were interested in our journalists, the constant churn presented a real challenge for us as we tirelessly pumped out seven editions of the paper to our readers all around the world 365 days a year.\n\nBy the time the Thursday afternoon diversity session of that conference rolled around I was feeling noble, haughty, and ready for what was coming at me.\n\nThe session was led by David Yarnold, the Managing Editor of the San Jose Mercury News . Turns out, I'd heard of Yarnold and his innovative initiatives to make diversity a key pillar in building a successful newsroom, but like any ornery journalist, I was skeptical as hell he really knew what he was talking about.\n\nI was about to be schooled.\n\nYarnold opened by making light of the skepticism that wafted over the auditorium concerning this diabolical subject. He'd obviously done this a time or two, and slowly began winning us over, before he positively blew my mind.\n\nYarnold asked us what a good newspaper must do to be successful. There was some mumbling in the audience, before somebody finally piped up and said, \"Accuracy! We must be accurate!\"\n\n\"Good, good,\" said Yarnold, \"What else??\"\n\nOnce again there was a murmuring, before somebody shouted, \"Credibility! We must be credible!\"\n\n\"Here, here,\" we all shouted in agreement.\n\n\"OK, OK,\" said Yarnold. \"So ... If a good newspaper has to be accurate ... and a good newspaper has to be credible ... Can a newspaper hope to be accurate and credible if the readers in its circulation area are comprised of 35 percent white people, 25 percent Hispanic people, 25 percent Black people, and 15 percent Asian people, while 85 percent of the newsroom is staffed with white people???????\"\n\nThat's when I said, \"Whoa ...\"\n\nI never looked at diversity in the newsroom, or any workplace, the same way again.\n\nLook, all people are created equal in America, but not all people are treated equally. This has everything to do with gender, sexual orientation, the color of their skin and/or what station they started at in life.\n\nSystematic and institutional racism abounds, and still holds far too many people down. If the majority of this reprehensible Supreme Court would rather ignore this undeniable fact, they can go straight to hell.\n\nIf a hardcore racist who sees \"fine people on both sides\" of a KKK rally wants to use that obscene ruling to inflict as much pain on people as possible, then he can most assuredly join them there.\n\nHow can we we claim to be a credible , caring country, if we won't do everything in our power to lift all our citizens up to make sure everybody has a chance to shine and contribute to the American Experiment?\n\nHow can we claim that we are addressing this seismic issue accurately and get the results all of us deserve, if we can't even have the decency and awareness to admit there is a problem in the first place?\n\nIf we are prepared to surrender this moral high ground, and what is most certainly good and right to the racist, authoritarian tyrants who are stepping on our necks without a fight, we will most assuredly join them in the low places they hide.\n\nThere will be no coming back from this, my friends, and it will be beyond horrid.\n\nNOW READ: Trump's crypto-ligarchy will blow up in his face - and possibly take the financial system with it\n\nD.

As always, if you have anything to add, the comment section will be left open to you.\n\nIt's never too late for us white guys to learn a thing or two ... Right, white guys?\n\nALSO READ: Donald Trump believes he's going to lose\n\nLook, I'm addressing you again today because frankly, I'm concerned I'm not getting through to too many of you white dudes out there, and selfishly it's beginning to embarrass me. You are now on the verge of being absolutely impossible to defend, or even be around.\n\nIf you read me at all regularly, you know I'm not much for all these damn political polls. I think they are endlessly wrong and often politically loaded, but enough of them consistently reveal the same odious thing: The majority of us white guys in America are lining up to do the worst-possible thing, and support the putrid, nuclear-powered liar and bigot, who attacked us.\n\nI mean, W - T - F?\n\nHow is it you STILL don't understand that there is no excuse for defending such a low-grade creep, who brags of writing love letters to dictators, and groping women because he thinks he can?\n\nDo you really defend this? Well, DO YOU??? What if he did this to your wife? Or your daughter? All good?\n\nTHINK about this, damn you.\n\nAnd what about the endless attacks on our military, where many of us served? He calls our fallen \"suckers and losers.\" He tromps on their graves to score political points. He has been called \"the most dangerous person to this country\" by HIS chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nI served my country, men, and this is absolutely disqualifying.\n\nAnd before we go further here, I'd like you to stop the childish eye-rolling about why I am only addressing white men, and not other men with this stern talking-to. I've heard some of you whine before about this one, and I am sick of it. It's pathetic. Grow up (but more on that later).\n\nI am addressing only white men, because we are so obviously the damn problem right now, and because I have had 64 years of experience being a white man, and not a single second of experience being a Latino, or a Black, or an Asian, or any other man ... I do know enough of these folks, however, and try my best to walk a mile in their shoes. I can tell you for a fact there are plenty of rocks in their roads that you (we) never once had to tiptoe over.\n\nOur skin color has given us ridiculous privilege we have not earned, and if you lack the minimal capacity to acknowledge at least that, then answer this question for me: Why, in the entire history of this country, has there only been one man of color elected president, and NO women?\n\nAnd another: Why, are the 10 richest people in America all white men?\n\nAnd one more: Why does the typical white household have nine times as much wealth as the typical Black household in America?\n\nI'll give you a brief answer to these questions before moving on: Because the capitalistic system was set up by white men to benefit other white men that's why. Because for hundreds of years only white property owners -men - were even allowed to vote in the \"United\" States of America, that's why.\n\nAnd if I'm breaking through at all here, and you want to learn more, please take the time to listen to this interview by the great Terry Gross on NPR with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson, who makes the iron-clad case American's caste system is behind our nation's terrible inequities.\n\nWhen you understand all this, is it any surprise then, that these damn polls consistently reveal the fact that men of color - some in overwhelming numbers - support Kamala Harris for president? Because of the path they have walked, they are smart enough to know for a fact that Trump is only interested in supporting the billionaire bastards who have been stepping on ALL OUR NECKS for centuries.\n\nIt's why he gives THEM tax cuts, not us. They OWN him.\n\nHe doesn't give a single shit about you, white guys. He only sees you as another pathetic mark in his endless con.\n\nSo a diverse cross-section of Americans, who bring a wealth of important and telling life experiences to the table, support the woman for president, and only us white guys are holding out for the monster who degrades them.\n\nYou realize how that makes us look, right? RIGHT????\n\nI'm not good with this, dammit, and for the life of me will never understand how you are either.\n\nBut if after reading this, you still aren't convinced, and are plenty pleased with yourself with being conned by this 78-year-old, dangerous jackass, and voting against your own interests, I have one final ask:\n\nI'd like you to go find a picture of that special woman in your life. Go ahead, I'll wait.\n\nOK, are you looking at this beautiful person? Are you thinking about all she has done for you, and given you?\n\nKeep staring into her beautiful eyes ... and ask yourself why you wouldn't do everything - I mean EVERYTHING - in your power to support her and the choices she makes.\n\nAsk yourself if you would allow this beautiful person to be jailed by another man who disagreed with her choices? Because this - and nothing less - is what is on the line in America right now, white men.\n\nAnd what if this woman you love so much was raped by another man, was impregnated, and because of Trump's heinous laws was forced to carry the fetus to term? You good with this, guys? Well, ARE YOU????\n\nWhat if this woman you love was bleeding out on an operating table, and because of Trump's depraved laws doctors were prevented from saving her life?\n\nStill all good?\n\nIt's not, is it.\n\nIt's terrible and barbaric.\n\nYou know, I've seen some pretty clever ads from Democrats recently aimed at women who live in households with insecure, abusive white men who expect their wives and daughters to vote like they do. You know what I'm talking about, fellas.\n\nThese ads make the sharp point that nobody has to know how you vote - that what each of us do in the voting booth is completely private. If quietly voting for the candidate who has your interests at heart will keep the peace in the household, then so be it. It is far better than acquiescing and voting for the monster, who wants to drag you back into the 1950s.\n\nWell, if any of you guys still aren't ready to publicly stand up to your macho male friends and relatives and urge them to do what's right by supporting the candidate who will protect all our rights , maybe the very least you can do is the right thing in the privacy of the voting booth.\n\nIt's a step in the right direction, and I guarantee the people you allege to love most will thank you for it.\n\nNOW READ: Why is this election even close?\n\nD.

      "text": "Leading  anti-racism activist explains how Trump's 'casual racism' fuels far-right terrorism\n\nOn the most basic level white privilege consists of the unearned advantages that those individuals who are defined as \"white\" in America and other societies enjoy, measured relative to and against other people.White privilege manifests itself in many ways. Sometimes this is obvious: institutional discrimination in housing, hiring and employment, as well as divergent levels of political power. Sometimes this is subtle: subconscious and implicit bias; \"microaggressions\"; cultural norms and double standards which are unfair to those people not considered white.Ultimately, the age of Donald Trump has been a triumph for white privilege in its many forms.\n\nA week or so ago, white privilege was omnipresent, loud, and unapologetic on the American national stage in ways that few reasonable people could deny. On Saturday there was an attack on a Jewish synagogue by a neo-Nazi terrorist in Poway, California. One person was killed and several others injured. Because he is a white man, this neo-Nazi terrorist of course became the subject of sympathetic profiles by mainstream journalists seeking to understand how such a \"religious\" young person from a \"devout Christian\" home could allegedly commit such horrible crimes.\n\nOn that same Saturday, a group of neo-Nazis targeted Dr. Jonathan Metzl while he gave a talk at the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington on his new book \"Dying of Whiteness.\" On the previous day, Donald Trump had continued to tell shameless lies about the Charlottesville riot of 2017, during which Heather Heyer was killed by a neo-Nazi. In a crude and gross channeling of white identity politics, Trump continues to insist that the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who ran amok in Charlottesville are \"very fine people\" who were really only concerned about saving a statue of Robert E. Lee, who could be viewed as the leader of a breakaway white supremacist army.\n\nIn total these are examples of white privilege as malevolent violence, excuse-making, entitlement and a refusal to be held accountable for one's behavior.\n\nWhat does this series of events reveal about the color line and \"race relations\" in the age of Trump? How should good people resist this Trump-inspired tide of racism, intolerance, and increasing violence directed against America's multiracial democracy? How do we understand white Christian terrorism, and why are so many Americans, especially politicians and journalists, afraid to use that specific language? How is the relationship between whiteness and Jewish identity being challenged and made more complex by resurgent anti-Semitism in the age of Trump?\n\nIn an effort to answer these questions, I recently spoke with Tim Wise, one of the nation's leading anti-racism activists and a frequent guest on MSNBC and other news outlets. Wise is the author of numerous books, including \" Dear White America: Letter to a New Minority \" and \" Under the Affluence: Shaming the Poor, Praising the Rich and Sacrificing the Future of America .\"\n\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nThe weekend before last there was a neo-Nazi terrorist attack on a synagogue in Poway, California, Jonathan Metzl was harassed by neo-Nazis in Washington, and President Trump continued to deliver outrageous falsehoods about what actually happened at the Charlottesville riot in 2017. How would you explain this coincidence of events?\n\nIn trying to make sense of Donald Trump, many people have a hard time connecting the dots between Donald Trump's rhetoric and anti-Semitic violence because they succumb to such claims as, \"Well, he doesn't really say hateful things about Jews.\" Or they may say things like, \"You know, Jared Kushner's Jewish, and Ivanka, she converted, and the grandkids are Jewish,\" or \"Trump also loves Israel.\"\n\nNever mind that a lot of us who are Jewish are not that supportive of Israel - so Trump does not get extra points. If the best argument for how he is supposedly taking on anti-Semitism is to talk about how much he loves Jews who live on the other side of the world, then he and his supporters are making a very weak and laughable claim. Trump supposedly loving Israel does not protect American Jews from American anti-Semitism.\n\nIn addition, the idea that you've got family who are Jewish and that supposedly insulates you from a charge of anti-Semitism is the wrong analogy. It is the equivalent of saying that if you're married to a woman, you can't be a sexist. If you have a black friend, you can't be a racist. Of course you can. You can view a larger group negatively, even if you carve out exceptions for a handful of friends or family.\n\nWe know that Donald Trump has made some old-school anti-Semitic comments about Jews, such as how he only wants them counting his money. Trump does not do the \"Jews are planning white genocide\" narrative, and I'm sure he doesn't even think like that. What people are missing is that it is not really Donald Trump's rhetoric about Jews that leads to synagogue shootings or other attacks on Jewish people.\n\nWhat encourages this violence is actually Trump's rhetoric about immigrants. Why? White nationalists and Nazis believe that Jews are behind nonwhite immigration to America and the West more generally. David Duke said this in his autobiography, which he wrote in 1998. He said he'd been looking at the immigration debate over the last hundred years, and the thing he uncovered was that the force behind lax immigration laws was always organized Jewry. That is the Nazi line. That is the white nationalist line.\n\nWhen Trump talks about immigration the way he does - rapists, killers, criminals and invaders - Trump is signaling to Nazis and other members of the white right that they have to do something about what they consider to be the source of the problem. In their mind it is Jewish people and Jewish financiers like George Soros, another frequent target of Trump's vitriol, who must be stopped.\n\nDonald Trump's intent does not matter. What does matter are the outcomes of his language and policies.\n\nI have to disagree. I used to believe that about Trump, but of late, the way he uses tropes and talking points about \"invaders\" from Latin and South America, his obsession with George Soros, retweeting white supremacists etc., I think Donald Trump knows exactly what he's doing.\n\nI really believe that his primary takeaway from the immigration debate is his focus on what he and his allies view as \"horrible brown people.\" I think he sees it in just pure racial terms, white vs. nonwhite. I think that Trump's anti-Semitism is more of the old-school garbage that one would hear at the country club and not at a Klan rally.  Is that anti-Semitism? Yes. Is it David Duke's kind of anti-Semitism? No. Is it Andrew Anglin's? No. It is the casual racism of a 72-year-old white man.\n\nFor Trump, George Soros is just a liberal billionaire - and Trump probably hates Soros more for being rich than anything to do with him being Jewish. It happens to be very convenient for the white nationalists and Nazis that George Soros is Jewish. If Soros were not Jewish then Donald Trump would still be attacking him.\n\nThe bottom line is parsing Trump's intent is a boring debate. I think it doesn't really matter because at the end of the day I know what the white nationalists are hearing. Again, Trump's intentionality does not matter so much as the effect of his rhetoric.\n\nHow is the age of Trump complicating the relationship between whiteness and (white) Jewish identity in America and the West?\n\nI hope that the age of Trump and what it has encouraged and directly spawned will lead to some needed discussions about a number of things. First, I hope that we will not take this upsurge in anti-Semitism as somehow an excuse to not deal with our white privilege as Jewish people. White privilege continues to operate in America and other countries against people of color. I hope we don't use this moment as a way to say, \"We don't really have white privilege, see? We're still hated and we're still hunted.\" Obviously, it complicates our white privilege, just like working-class white folks have a complicated type of white privilege, just like LGBTQ white folks have a complicated type of white privilege, and just like white women have a complicated type of white privilege.\n\nNuance is important in these discussions and types of analysis. Multiple things can be true at one time. I as a Jewish person can be advantaged on one level because I am socially and culturally seen as white. I am considered to be \"white\" by employers, police, teachers, etc.\n\nBut I as a Jewish person can also occasionally be the target of hatred by individuals or groups and yes, by society at large. Now, at this particular point, I do not think that we can make a very good argument for institutionalized anti-Semitism on a large scale in this country. What we are now dealing with is more individual-level hatred. This threat is very real. What is also real is that for at least a half-century, Jewish folks have functioned pretty much as white people in America.\n\nThe second thing I hope we can do in the age of Trump is to work with our Muslim brothers and sisters to recognize the need that we have for solidarity in this moment. Right now, obviously, there's a lot that divides Jewish and Muslim folk, particularly around the so-called Middle East: Palestine and Israel, particularly around the BDS movement. We've got to talk that through and work that through, and we've got to find some real workable peace and justice solutions for Palestine and for Israel and for the people who live in that part of the world.\n\nHaving said that, while we all, American Muslims and American Jews in particular, are trying to talk about these issues we must be sure to highlight that a person is not automatically assumed to be anti-Semitic because they criticize Israel or because they support the BDS movement. We also need to be mindful how one should be able to criticize Israel and not use anti-Semitic tropes while doing so. If we can do that, then Muslim Americans and Jewish Americans can come together and work on common solutions to the problem of how right now, in this moment, we are both under the gun, literally.\n\nOur common enemy is white nationalism and white supremacy. Maybe this provides an opening for Muslims and Jews to sit down and say, \"You see what they're doing? You see what they're doing? They want us to fight.\" It's the same thing that white supremacy does with all people of color. It tries to pit black against Asian and Latino. It tries to pit everybody against Native Americans. Maybe this moment of threat and danger will remind some Jewish folks that whiteness is a guest pass and it can be revoked. We need to be bonding with other marginalized people rather than trying to suck up to people at the top and become part of the power structure, which is what I'm afraid far too many people have done.\n\nGiven the threat posed by right-wing militias - and now an increasing amount of violence by neo-Nazis and other white supremacists - there needs to be a sustained public conversation about white Christian terrorism in America and other parts of the world.\n\nWe might be willing to call it \"far-right terrorism.\" Some politicians, journalists and others will even be willing to call it \"white racist terrorism,\" though not Donald Trump and not the people in this administration. Yet to call it Christian is almost never done. When you try to do so, of course, they will trot out the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. This is easily deflected and exposed: If there are all these people calling themselves Christians and engaging in terrorism, then why not call it out for what it is?\n\nMuslims are not given that pass for sure. If someone is a terrorist acting on behalf of ISIS, it would be absurd not to call them Muslim. But at the same time we certainly should not call it \"Muslim terrorism,\" Wahhabism generally does not represent Islam any more than it would be the case that Dominionist Christianity represents Christianity.\n\nWe certainly should be calling it Jewish terrorism or Christian terrorism when it's on the other side, and we just don't. We don't do it whether it's in Israel when a Jewish settler is committing some horrible, atrocious assault on Muslim people or when it is someone in the United States attacking a synagogue or a mosque. We need some consistency. And we need to be able to have that consistency precisely so that the vast majority of Christians who reject such thinking, that white Christian terrorist violence and behavior, actually feel compelled to distance themselves from it.\n\nWhenever there's an act of Muslim terrorism conservatives will say \"Where are the other Muslims condemning it?\" Well, the fact is, Muslims do this all the time.\n\nWhen so-called Christians commit acts of terrorism, I don't remember the last time that a Christian conservative evangelical leader, stood up and said, \"Oh, my God, this was horrific.\" Even if they might say it's horrific, they're not going to stand up and say, \"How dare this person claim to be a Christian? We renounce this in the name of our faith.\" They never would do that. They offer up their thoughts and prayers, and they move about their business. Rarely do church leaders distance themselves from people who are committing terrorist acts in their name.\n\nA simple counterfactual is very illustrative. If it was brown or black folks or Muslims shooting up white churches and engaging in other types of terrorism the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI would not be ordered to stand down, as has taken place under Trump's regime.\n\nIf Christopher Hasson were a Muslim and he had a kill list and stockpiled weapons - and especially if he were a person of color, a Muslim of color - there is absolutely no question that right now any Muslim in the United States armed services would be investigated. They wouldn't necessarily all be purged, but I guarantee they would all be under some type of suspicion. They certainly would not have been on the verge of being let go without punishment or prison sentence.\n\nAs the default, when a white terrorist or mass shooter commits a heinous crime - there are already stories in the mainstream news media humanizing the neo-Nazi who is accused of attacking the synagogue in Poway, California.\n\nI still don't know anything at all about the 9/11 hijackers' families and childhoods. I don't know anything about Mohamed Atta. I do think it's important to humanize people, because even if it's not to excuse behavior, we as a society should want to understand the root causes of pathological and other dangerous behavior. If we are going to do that for the Christopher Hassons of the world, if we're going to do that for this shooter in New Zealand, if we're going to do that for this shooter in California at the synagogue, then we ought to do it for everyone. At present it largely seems that humanizing these alleged terrorists and other killers is done in such as way as to protect white folks and demean black and brown folks.\n\nPlease explain Donald Trump's continued evasions and outright lies about the Charlottesville hate riot. This is all part of a right-wing conspiracy theory trafficked by the so-called \"Charlottesville truthers.\"\n\nThe fact is that Donald Trump made three different statements about what happened in Charlottesville. The first one he made involved him absolutely 100% downplaying the problem of white supremacy and white supremacists by saying that there were \"good people on both sides.\" Then the second statement Trump said, which was scripted, he condemned white supremacy, racism and hatred. Then the next day Trump gets asked about Charlottesville again, and he's off script and goes back to what he really thinks and feels.\n\nAll the reporting indicated that Trump was angry at himself for backtracking earlier. He wanted to go back to his original statement, which is what he really believed. It is very clear that Donald Trump did not and does not view what happened in Charlottesville as a right-wing racist riot but that is exactly what it was.\n\nWhen he says there are good people on both sides, first, for the sake of argument let's just take him at his word that he didn't mean the Nazis. Well, then who does Trump mean? He says, \"people were there for the statue.\" Who were they? Because what he said the other day was, \"You know, the night before the rally\" - which is when Heather Heyer was murdered - \"the night before the rally was when they went to the statue.\"\n\nRight. That's the night they went with the tiki torches, yelling, \"Jews will not replace us,\" and, \"Blood and soil,\" to the Robert E. Lee statue. They then attacked a group of anti-racists. Contrary to some of the fictions, there was no antifa attack. The white supremacists attacked anti-racist organizers who were surrounding the statue peacefully. They were not legally on that campus. The people who surrounded the statue actually did have a right to be there because many of them were UVA students.\n\nWhen Trump says, \"I'm talking about the people the night before and they were there for the statue,\" there is nobody since the summer of 2017 who has come out and said, \"I was only there for the statue. I just went there to defend the Confederate memorials.\" Not one person who was there has come out and said .- and you know they would if there was such a person - \"I went there to defend these statues, but, oh my God, I was horrified by the fact that there were Nazis. I was stunned. I was shocked. I didn't expect that, and then I went up to them and I said, 'Oh my God, you clearly have misunderstood our intention.'\"\n\nNot one person has come out and said that they left in disgust when they saw Nazi symbols or they heard Nazi slogans. Not one person ever came out and said, \"Oh my God, I renounce this, I didn't know what I was getting myself into, this is terrible.\" These people are not history buffs. It was called, for God's sake, the Unite the Right rally. It wasn't called the Defend Robert E. Lee's Statue rally.\n\nThere was nothing the night before that was any less bigoted, any less Nazi-ish, any less racist than what happened the next day. Even taking him at his word, Trump's argument about Charlottesville does not make any sense whatsoever.\n\nIf Donald Trump really had a problem with the racists who support him and who openly acknowledge their support for him, he would do more than simply criticize them when he's asked multiple times about the issue.\n\nTrump would call a press conference and say, \"Listen, it is obvious that I have been misunderstood from the very beginning, and I don't know why. I think I speak very clearly. I have the best words, after all, but clearly you all have not understood me. Let me make it very clear. Not only do I not believe these things, I renounce all of these ideologies and I renounce you personally. I don't want your support. If you are a white supremacist or a white nationalist, I do not want your vote. I do not want your support. I don't want my name in your mouth.\"\n\nThese are perilous times. What would you tell those folks who have seen Jonathan Metzl being harassed or know that you have experienced similar things, who want to speak out and get involved in the struggle against Trump, or fighting for civil and human rights, but are afraid?\n\nWe all have to make a calculus about what we're going to do in this particular moment, and what we're going to do tomorrow and next week and next year. Although there may be better times and worse times to make certain statements and decisions, you cannot run away forever from truth-telling and fighting for justice.\n\nIf we do not do it the problem metastasizes. And at some point the calculus has to be, what is the greater risk? Is the greater risk speaking up and knowing that I'm going to attract the attention of people who might indeed want to harm me? Or is the greater risk remaining quiet and knowing that if they gain power they are still going to harm me anyway?\n\nIt's not as if you're going to be safe if they come to power and they just never heard your voice before. If they come to power and you have any principles whatsoever that are progressive and decent and humane, or if you are Jewish or if you are a person of color, or if you are liberal or if you are a feminist or if you are LGBTQ, or if you are anything that is not them, they are going to come for you.\n\nThere's no safety in silence unless you know for a fact that they will never win. I don't know for a fact that they will never win. The silence and the lack of moral rectitude and not standing up to these kinds of hateful people will only hasten the demise of a democratic and multicultural society. When that happens it is going to be quite a bit too late for you to start tweeting out your concerns.\n\nThere is strength in numbers. The more people who speak out, the more safe all of us will be. The danger is when it's only a handful of people, but if there are hundreds of us, if there are thousands, if there are tens of thousands, if there are millions of people who are speaking up with one voice, then several things are true. No. 1, they can't kill us all, and No. 2, they'll be less likely to try to kill any if us, because they will understand that there is a countervailing force trying to raise the cost of this type of behavior."

      "text": "A political scientist explains how a bunch of dangerous myths brought us the 'president for white people'\n\nToday's Republican Party is the largest, most powerful and most dangerous white racist organization in the United States -- if not the world. Donald Trump, the president of the United States, is its leader. These are plain if not understated facts. No embellishment is needed. The examples are many. Over the last few days Donald Trump has repeatedly dug into his bucket of racist political scatology, saying on Twitter and elsewhere that four nonwhite members of Congress (\"Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen,\" as he mockingly put it) should leave America and go back to their own \"crime infested\" and \"totally broken\" countries.\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib were all born in the United States. Rep. Ilhan Omar is a naturalized citizen who was born in Somalia. This is not the first time that Donald Trump has said such vile things, which are almost word-for-word white supremacist or white nationalist talking points about how being a \"real American\" means one must first and foremost be \"white\" - and that nonwhites should be removed from the United States if they do not submit to white rule and authority.\n\nTrump's racism is part of a much larger pattern of white supremacist behavior by his administration: Interning nonwhite migrants and immigrants in concentration camps, seeking to ban Muslims from entering the United States, suggesting that black athletes who oppose police brutality are traitors, changing the country's immigration laws with the aim of maintaining a white majority, and disenfranchising nonwhite people through gerrymandering, voter suppression, voter intimidation and other tactics, legal and otherwise.\n\nRepublican elected officials almost unanimously support Trump's racist agenda. To wit: only four Republicans voted \"yes\" in support of Tuesday's House resolution condemning Donald Trump's gross and obvious racism.\n\nSenior Republican leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Sen. Mitt Romney have either stated support for Trump's racist comments or avoided answering questions about them.\n\nTrump's White House spokespeople and the right-wing media have of course enthusiastically supported Donald Trump's most recent example of public white supremacy. Public opinion polls show that support for Donald Trump has grown among Republican voters because of his racist attacks.\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party's racist agenda is in service to white identity politics and a foundational assumption that white people should always and forever be the most privileged  and dominant group in the United States. But what are the specific contours of white identity politics, and why has it been so politically effective and personally seductive for Trump, the Republican Party and their voters? Is white identity politics an existential threat to America's multiracial democracy? What does it mean to be \"white\" in post-civil rights America? Are white men and white women invested in white identity in the same way?\n\nIn an effort to answer these questions I recently spoke with Ashley Jardina, a professor of political science at Duke University and author of the new book \"White Identity Politics.\"\n\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow did America arrive at a moment where it would elect a person like Donald Trump as president? Was this disaster caused by an inevitable white backlash against Barack Obama?\n\nI would not say that Donald Trump's presidency was inevitable. But I do think there is a confluence of events which took place. For the entire history of the United States, white people have had the majority of social, economic and political power. There have been different periods of time in which that power has seemed less secure or it's been chipped away at. This is especially true at present and over the last decade. This has been partly caused by immigration.\n\nOf course there is the symbolic power which came from the election of the nation's first African-American president Barack Obama. As a result of these factors, many whites in the United States are starting to feel like their place at the top of the pyramid is no longer guaranteed and that the United States no longer looks like a \"white nation\" which is dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture. This arrangement looks like it may be in jeopardy to many white people. Donald Trump is very much a response to the feelings of threat and insecurity that many whites in the United States are experiencing.\n\nThese narratives about the \"browning of America\" are very problematic. Historically in America, groups formerly viewed as \"nonwhite\" are eventually included in the category of who is \"white\" so that white people as a group can remain numerically superior over blacks and other people of color. Why wouldn't \"white\" Hispanics - such as some Cubans, for example - simply not be grandfathered into whiteness?\n\nLatinos have not been subsumed by whiteness yet. There is an argument that eventually, just as took place with the Irish and Italians in the late 19th and mid-20th century, where those groups transitioned into whiteness, that this will happen with Latinos too. But such a crossing over into whiteness has not happened yet for them. There are pressures against that happening quickly. For example, there is a big push to get Latinos in the United States to develop a pan-ethnic Latino identity because it's politically strategic, particularly for Democrats.\n\nThere are these common criticisms that \"identity politics\" is bad. What is so problematic with such a complaint is that \"identity politics\" for people of color and for underrepresented groups like women is often the consequence of shared experiences of oppression and subordination. \"Identity politics\" is a way for marginalized groups to achieve political power and political representation of their interests.\n\nIn many ways this is a story of perception versus reality. It's certainly true that whites still have the majority of power and resources in America. There is not a great deal of evidence to suggest that has been dramatically chipped away at. After the 2010 census there were all these grand predictions being made about America's changing racial demographics. There were all these articles appearing about how whites as a group were going to lose their numerical majority.\n\nThen you've got the major symbolism of Barack Obama and the fact that Barack Obama won his second term - but not with the white vote. Obama had the lowest share of white voters of any successful presidential candidate. Obama won because of a coalition of people of color. Taken in total, all of these dynamics lead to a misperception that the power and privilege of whites in America is somehow being threatened.\n\nThis obsession by the mainstream corporate  media with chronicling the \"Lost Americans\" in TrumpLandia - meaning \"white working class\" red-state denizens - is a tedious new subgenre of writing. One of the themes has been white Trump voters saying that \"Well, the blacks had Obama now we've got a white man to do something for white people.\" Such claims are detached from any sense of reality, yet the sentiment resonates across White America.\n\nThere is a sense of white group identity and racial animus prefaced on a belief, however incorrect, that Barack Obama was going to do things just for black people and other nonwhites. Of course we know that was not true. Nonetheless, Donald Trump is very much seen as the response to Barack Obama. Trump is the person who is going to come in and help white people.\n\nIn my new book \"White Identity Politics,\" I examine public opinion data and other research which demonstrates that there really is this feeling among a certain subset of white people who believe the government is not doing things for them. These white people want benefits for their group. This helps to explain why Donald Trump was a successful candidate, even though he is an unconventional Republican.\n\nTrump went against the traditional Republican platform by promising to expand government, to protect Social Security, to protect Medicare and basically to provide government benefits that white people wanted. It's not just about \"small government\" or taking power away from people of color. Trump's appeal is about whites wanting to feel like they're getting some share of government benefits and support. This is of course wrong: White Americans receive a disproportionate share of resources whether that's from the government or just the overall economic, social and political resources in the United States.\n\nHow do these working-class Trump voters reconcile the fact that he and the Republican party are actually enacting policies which make their lives materially worse? Is this just the old story of the \"wages of whiteness,\" where Trump's racism gives his white voters a sense of power over and against nonwhites, even if they are being hurt economically?\n\nAmerican voters are not that sophisticated. These white voters see Trump as the candidate that's for the white person. They might not actually be getting the resources that they want, but they're not really thinking about it in a narrow, material way. What these white people are thinking is, \"Hey, Trump is there for my group. He's going to help white people. He's the president for white people.\"\n\nMotivated reasoning is very important here too. This is the psychological process through which people are going to believe things that are consistent with their prior beliefs, and they're going to reject information that's inconsistent with them. Trump might not be doing a good job helping this particular subset of voters. He might not be delivering on his promises. But his supporters are going to want to believe that he is. Trump's voters and other supporters are going to be highly resistant to being disappointed.\n\nHow do you define the oft-used and often vague phrase and concept \"white identity politics\"?\n\nThe idea behind \"white identity politics\" is that there is a subset of white voters and/or white Americans in general who feel a sense of attachment to their group. They feel a sense of solidarity. They think that their race and their racial identity is important to who they are. Their \"white identity\" influences how they see and view the political world. Tied up in that sense of identity is a belief that whites are losing out in the United States, their status and power is somehow under threat. Subsequently those white people who manifest white identity politics are responding to that perception in a political way by supporting policies and candidates who they view as protecting their racial group and preserving its status.\n\nDonald Trump is a candidate who campaigned on limiting nonwhite immigration, building a wall and doing things that were going to preserve America's literal \"whiteness.\" Trump also promised to provide and support policies such as Social Security and Medicare. These programs disproportionately benefit white people. Donald Trump is an isolationist. \"America First\" and \"Make America Great Again\" are also isolationist slogans.  Donald Trump is very much the candidate of white identity - but white identity mattered before Trump came on the scene.\n\nEmpirical data shows that whites who felt a sense of solidarity with their racial group were far less likely to vote for Barack Obama in 2012. This did not just suddenly appear in 2016. There has been evidence of this type of racially motivated voting and other political behavior for some time.\n\nAmerica was founded as a racialized democracy. Denying nonwhites their human and civil rights was not generally viewed by white elites and the white mass public as being incompatible with \"freedom\" and \"democracy.\" How do we reconcile your research on white identity politics with America's history and present as a racialized democracy?\n\nWhat we are seeing at present is the maintenance of a system of white supremacy. I want to be clear when I use the term \"white supremacy.\" People tend to recoil from that term because they think of white supremacy as the Ku Klux Klan. I'm not talking about those people exclusively. They are a very small subset of white people who show overt, explicit racial prejudice.\n\nThere is a much larger percentage of whites in United States who are not particularly high on racial prejudice. I would not call them bigots, but they still want to preserve and protect the privileges of their group. In doing so they are ultimately preserving a system and system of racial hierarchy in which white people are at the top.\n\nFor a long time whiteness was associated with mainstream America. Whites had the privilege of not having to think about their race. Nonwhites have their life outcomes overdetermined by their race. Race impacts how nonwhites navigate the world and think about political and the social reality. It is not until whites start to feel some threat or anxiety that white identity politics is activated. Whiteness is very salient in the Age of Trump.\n\nBut of course we can go back in time and consider other moments when white identity mattered more, such as the civil rights movement, and debates in the early part of the 20th century about immigration and preserving the \"Nordic stock\" and \"Anglo-Saxon heritage\" of the nation.\n\nThese moments were very explicit about the idea that America was a white country and \"we\" had to protect this particular flavor or idea of whiteness and a \"White America.\" But in between these periods of time, whites have had the luxury of not having to think about their race because they got to define what it means to be an \"American\" and what constitutes \"mainstream America.\"\n\nHow do experts who study and write about race and racial inequality understand and use terms such as \"racism\" and \"whiteness\" in a way that the general public does not?\n\nFirst of all, \"white identity\" is not the same thing as overt racism or overt prejudice. Now, they're certainly related in important ways. We often think about racism in two ways. One is learned dislike or antipathy for an out-group. For whites we often talk about whites just disliking people of color generally. And often, when we discuss racism we consider how whites dislike blacks in particular which manifests through a particular set of negative stereotypes that they associate with black people and blackness.\n\nAnother way of thinking about racism is a denial of structural inequality - and this can be ignorance or willful - and how nonwhites experience discrimination in the United States. This racist logic proceeds from an assumption that everyone has a type of equal opportunity and to the extent to which there is racial inequality, it is caused by people of color not working hard enough or not abiding by particular cherished \"American values\" such as \"hard work\" and \"patriotism.\" This is symbolic racism. The difference with white identity is that it is an in-group attitude; it is about wanting to protect and preserve white identity.\n\nYes, white identity is still part of the system of racism because it's about wanting to maintain their power at the top. By implication, this means that people of color necessarily cannot be equal with white people. This type of white identity is about maintaining a system of inequality. But from a psychological perspective, this is not the same thing as just disliking or having negative attitudes towards a racial out-group.\n\nWhat do we know about the road from the Tea Party to Donald Trump's Republican Party and the racialization of white group identity?\n\nOver the period of time in which the Tea Party got its momentum, there was a  very clear shift in support towards white people who measure very high on indicators of symbolic racism and racial resentment.\n\nLooking at the data from 2012 to the present I do not see a strong relationship between white identity and Tea Party support.  instead I see a really strong relationship between racial resentment and Tea Party support, which should not be surprising.\n\nThe Tea Party was very much latching on to an idea that \"big government\" was just giving \"handouts\" to people and that we needed to reduce the size of government. Such an argument is closely tied to symbolic racism and the idea that \"undeserving\" groups in the United States are \"taking advantage\" of government and that whites are paying too much into the system and not getting enough back. In total, the Tea Party and racial prejudice are tightly linked together.\n\nHow does gender interact with white identity?\n\nThere are gender differences with respects to levels of white identity. I often find that a slightly higher percentage of white women identify as being white as compared relative to white men. In some ways this runs counter to a narrative that I have never found very compelling. There is this argument that the most disgruntled and aggrieved person in the United States is the working-class white man. From that premise one would expect such a person to measure high on indicators of white identity. In fact it is white women who identify as being white, more so than do white men.\n\nOne potential hypothesis is that people tend to want to  identify with higher status groups. If you're a white woman and you have a choice between identifying with your gender or your race you are likely going to pick your race because it is the higher status identity.\n\nHistorically and through to the present, white women have been deeply involved with supporting, enforcing and benefiting from white supremacy. How does this complicate alliances across the color line between women?\n\nThere are several things going on here. Many people think that white women are really aligned with the Democratic Party. They are not. Most white women in the United States have voted for Republican candidates. There have only been two elections since the 1950s in which the majority of white women have not voted for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nWhy is this? Married white women tend to adopt the partisanship of their husbands. White women are moved to vote for Republicans in part because of the influence of their husbands. I can imagine a response where someone says, \"That's so disappointing.\" Most people do not realize that white women in the United States are not very progressive when it comes to their views about gender roles. We have the sense that women are vastly more supportive of egalitarian gender roles in the United States, and that's not actually true. In fact, women in general, and white women in particular, are pretty supportive of more traditional gender roles.\n\nThis is not very surprising. Women have traditionally been more excluded from the political world. As such, it is less likely that they are  going to develop their own separate sorts of political interests or political views from their husbands. That is just the reality of gender dynamics in the United States. There have also been some interesting patterns when we look at the 2016 presidential election. There was a really big educational divide that has not been observed in previous elections. If you look back to 2012 and compare white women with a college degree and those without a college degree, the two groups did not vote that differently.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 white women with a college degree who were not happy about Trump were much more likely to vote for Clinton.\n\nWhat of the obvious and overt white supremacy increasingly advocated for by Republicans such as Steve King and, of course, Donald Trump? How does that fit into your findings about white identity politics?\n\nI've asked people on surveys the extent to which they think that whites have made greater contributions to human civilization than people of color. A huge percentage of white Americans agree that whites have made greater contributions.\n\nOne of the dangers of white identity politics is that white people as a group definitely do not want to associate themselves with the Ku Klux Klan. They do not want to be seen as white supremacists. Nevertheless many white Americans do hold such attitudes. And these attitudes do start to look a lot like those which are espoused by bonafide members of white supremacist hate organizations.\n\nThis is where we really need to start worrying as a country: These arguments by white extremist groups are starting to sound pretty persuasive to a sizable group of white people. If these dangerous messages are being delivered by politicians who are not wearing white Klan robes, but instead who seem like they have some degree of decorum, then that racism seems reasonable. I believe that many white people are willing to openly adopt the views of white hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and others.\n\nWhat does whiteness and white identity mean for white voters in Trump's America, versus white people who supported Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton?\n\nMany of the white voters who supported Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton do not really think about their racial identity or feel a strong attachment to it. And there is a subset of these white voters for Obama and Clinton who do possess a more progressive type of white identity where they recognize the privileges or advantages that they have as a result of being white in this country and would prefer a more racially egalitarian society.\n\nWhat are you most worried about regarding America's future? Does anything give you hope?\n\nI'm worried about going backwards and away from the racial progress we have made as a society here in the United States. I'm also worried about the increasing legitimacy of racialized language and racism.\n\nIf we look at public opinion data, Donald Trump is not doing well. There is some hope: A sizable percentage of both white Americans and Americans of color are angry about our current political moment with Donald Trump and all that he has done to the country."

      "text": "Fox disputes 'massively racist' host's comment about Harris addressing 'colored' sorority\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to include a response from Fox News stating that Kilmeade said \"college sorority\" instead of \"colored sorority,\" along with tweets from Black journalists disputing Fox's explanation. The headline has also been updated.\n\nFox News host Brian Kilmeade recently made a eyebrow-raising comment on Wednesday's episode of Fox & Friends about Vice President (and now presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential nominee) Kamala Harris.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris - who is a graduate of a historically Black college and a member of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority - will address the Zeta Phi Beta sorority's annual convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. While Harris won't be attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress, she will be meeting with him one-on-one prior to the address.\n\nKilmeade made no mention of Harris' solo meeting with Netanyahu when criticizing her decision to not attend his joint address. And he notably used a decades-old descriptor for Black Americans when describing Zeta Phi Beta.\n\n\"She will not show up for the Prime Minister's joint session of Congress. She'd rather address - in the summer - a sorority, a colored sorority, like she can't get outta that!\" Kilmeade said.\n\nKilmeade's remark drew widespread criticism from journalists, commentators and others on X (formerly Twitter). Former Pennsylvania Democratic state lawmaker Brian Sims encouraged his followers to \"call out this kind of racism every single time you hear it.\"\n\n\"The word 'colored' is a massively racist Jim Crow relic that has no business in anyone's mouth, especially a white person's,\" he tweeted. \"Every single time you hear it, it's wrong. Say so.\"\n\nHamilton R. Grant, who is the Democratic nominee for South Carolina's 79th house district, shared his own experience of encountering racism as a Black candidate seeking elected office.\n\n\"Black candidates experience racism like you wouldn't believe,\" he wrote. \"Racist attacks like this is what sparks the very same political violence people condemned a few weeks ago.\"\n\nDemocratic campaign consultant Tim Fullerton opined that Kilmeade's \"colored\" attack meant that Fox hosts \"aren't hiding their racism anymore.\" MSNBC host Katie Phang called the remark \" disgusting .\" SiriusXM radio host Zerlina Maxwell quote-tweeted the video of Kilmeade's comment and simply wrote, \"wow.\"\n\nJulie Roginsky, whose bio describes her as a \"former Fox News and CNBC contributor,\" reminded her followers that Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who is former President Donald Trump's 2024 running mate, is also not attending Netanyahu's speech. However, she noted that \"Fox won't say a word about his absence or where he might be going instead\" because \"he is a white man.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement to AlterNet, a Fox News spokesperson disputed that Kilmeade said \"colored\" and insisted he said \"college sorority\" instead. The spokesperson pointed out that Politico correspondent Eugene Daniels - who first drew attention to Kilmeade's comment - deleted his initial tweet.\n\n\"Eugene Daniels' now deleted tweet completely misquoted and unnecessarily maligned Brian Kilmeade who clearly said college sorority,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nDaniels wrote in a subsequent tweet that he spoke to the network - who assured him that executives would speak to Kilmeade off the air - and that he chose to \"take Brian and his team at their word.\" However, two other Black journalists cast doubt on Fox News' explanation. Both Touré and April Reign tweeted that they both heard \"colored\" instead of \"college,\" and that \"college sorority\" was superfluous phrasing.\n\n\"Are there non-college sororities? There would be no need for him to clarify college sorority as opposed to non-college sorority. I heard colored,\" Touré wrote . \"But either he's a moron who says racist things (Fox) or he's a marble-mouthed word garbler which is unacceptable in a broadcaster.\"\n\n\"He said 'colored.' 'College sorority' is redundant and them trying to save face,\" Reign tweeted . \"No need to belabor it.\"\n\nWatch the video of Kilmeade's remarks below, or by clicking this link ."

      "text": "'Hillbilly Elegy' author JD Vance faces backlash over remarks connecting nationalism to fertility rate\n\nJ.D. Vance , the author of the best-selling Rust Belt memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and the whisperer of the white working-class , is under fire after calling himself a \"nationalist who worries about America's low fertility.\"\n\nCritics view the label as a nod to both white nationalism and the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory , the racist fear that falling birthrates among white women will lead to whites being replaced by non-whites.\n\n\"As a parent of young children and a nationalist who worries about America's low fertility I can say with confidence that daylight savings time reduces fertility by at least 10 percent,\" Vance wrote in a Sunday evening tweet .\n\nVance later characterized his tweet as a joke, though he did not clarify its meaning.\n\nHe also neither explained his use of the word \"nationalist,\" which over the last few years has been widely associated with white nationalism, nor his curious claims about fertility. (Most Americans set their clocks back an hour over the weekend, returning to standard time.)\n\nVance's 2017 memoir about growing up in what he describes as extended Appalachia was widely hailed as a sort of Rosetta stone for understanding the plight of the white working-class who supported President Donald Trump in 2016. The book topped best seller lists, making Vance a momentary celebrity pundit as Democrats grappled with Trump's election. The New York Times called it \"a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass.\"\n\nBut Vance has also been widely criticized for the conclusions he draws from his experiences, as well as for ignoring racial undertones in the culture about which he writes. His comments over the weekend drew similar criticism after being seen by many as dogwhistles for white nationalism and misogyny.\n\nWhile some have argued that \"nationalism\" with no adjectival modifier may apply to anyone who feels positively about their country, Vance, a white man and graduate of Yale law, explicitly connects a worry about fertility rates to his nationalism.\n\nPeople quickly pointed out that Vance's phrasing echoed the ideology of white supremacists, who have worried for years about declining white birth rates in Western countries. For instance, the white supremacist who carried out a mass shooting at a New Zealand mosque in 2018 repeated the phrase \"it's about the birth rates\" several times in his manifesto.\n\nA number of right-wing figures in Trump's circle play loosely with the phrase, including Stephens Miller and Bannon, who publicly soften their far-right views with phrases like \"populism\" and \"economic nationalism\" and a strategically nonspecific concern for \"our civilization.\" White supremacists have also embraced the generic use of the word \"nationalism\" as a wink, and Trump himself has used it to troll critics .\n\n\"Americans act with the understanding that Trump's nationalism promises to restore traditional boundaries of race, gender, and sexuality,\" The Atlantic's Adam Serwer wrote in 2017. \"The nature of that same nationalism is to deny its essence, the better to salve the conscience and spare the soul.\"\n\nJared Yates Sexton, an author and political journalist who grew up in Indiana, has criticized Vance's book as \"traditional right-wing propaganda\" that traffics in white supremacist undertones. He told Salon that Vance's comments revealed what many people had long suspected.\n\n\"J.D. Vance has spent the past few years sanitizing right-wing appeals and camouflaging white supremacist-pandering,\" Sexton said. \"I'm surprised it took him this long to let his mask slip.\"\n\nSalon's Amanda Marcotte pointed out that Vance's remarks also reveal the misogyny that undergirds white nationalist ideology .\n\n\"It's an effective troll, because you can't 'prove' that these people are malicious when there's always the outside, absurd possibility that they might not know what they're saying,\" Marcotte said. \"But it is also part and parcel of what white supremacist groups like the Proud Boys do: making white nationalist arguments that are rooted in misogyny.\"\n\nWhile Vance later framed his concern as applying to the country's ability to sustain its social net as the population ages, the U.S. has historically supplemented its workforce with an open immigration policy. It is unclear why internal birth rates would alone cause Vance such concern.\n\nIndeed, a 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while the country's fertility rate had been dropping, that fact was nothing new. \"The (total fertility) rate has generally been below replacement since 1971 and consistently below replacement since 2007,\" the report read.\n\nSalon reached out to Vance through his publisher, but did not receive a reply."

      "text": "Three Words About the White Man\n\n\"We certainly were stunned to see the things we saw. And we were shamed at, the laughing people laughed at our loin-cloths of beaten bark. None but us on the big path worn that old thing of beaten bark. All wore the things bought of the white man. We felt shame. And none spoke our speech.\"\n\nI. The Rock\n\nOne day in the dry season, that is, three dry seasons back, the white man said that he must go to Nkotoven by the Mebem path. When Nzwango heard this news he said he, too, - he must go.\n\nAnd the white man said, 'When has Nzwango carried a load?'\n\nFor Nzwango was not a youth, that he should carry a load, but a real person. White was upon his head.\n\n'Even so, if you go by the Mebem path I must go in your company. For I was born in the country that lies between Mebem and Nkotoven-I was born at Mbekom. When I was a child my tribe still lived in that neighborhood. Many nights my heart has desired to return to Mbekom, that I may again see the place where I was born. And the rock where God passed and the mark of his foot on the rock.'\n\n'Who passed?' said the white man.\n\n'God,' said Nzwango, 'Zambe. If you have never head that the mark of God's foot is on the great rock at Mbekom you are indeed a stranger.'\n\n'I have not yet heard that news,' said the white man. 'Since I was born I have never seen the mark of God's foot. You must certainly walk in my company and show me this strange thing.'\n\nBecause of this word Nzwango carried a load when we went to Nkotoven. He carried the white man's bed. And every day he walked behind our master on the bad path that goes from Mebem to Nkotoven. Close behind him he walked and every day he told him about the things of the past-the things that he had known when he was a lad in Mbekom. We people who walked in the caravan had never heard Nzwango speak so much; he was a person to sit still in the palaver house or to hunt by himself. Already white was upon his head. But now he spoke all day to the white man about the river of Mbekom where there were many fish, so that the women had always a little fish to bake in a leaf, and about the cliff where the dwarf fell off when he was nutting, and about the rock where God slept one night on his way out of the forest to the sea. In that place is the mark of his foot and the feet of the goat that walked in his company. No real person of our tribe but has heard news of this thing. Nzwango because he was born there felt pride in his heart that he was showing the path to the white man.\n\nAll day for four days he spoke of these things. On the fifth day in the morning we came out of the real forest into the plantain gardens of Mbekom. We walked through gardens, those that were old and those that were new, until the sun was in the middle. Nzwango showed the white man the hills of that country.\n\n'They are as I left them,' said Nzwango.\n\nAnd the white man believed.\n\nWhen the sun was in the middle we passed the great cliff where the dwarf fell. We very much remember this thing because it is strange that a dwarf should fall.\n\nThe white man believed.\n\nWhen we came near the town of Mbekom we met little boys and Nzwango asked them news.\n\n'Are there still fish to be caught beyond the place of reeds in the river?'\n\n'Éké! but plenty!' said the little boys.\n\n'Do you cross the river by the log of the duma tree that my father felled?'\n\n'How should we know your father?' said the little boys. 'There is no log where we cross the river. We cross on our feet.'\n\n'It was in felling that tree that my father died. Are the palm trees that my father planted great trees in the street of the village?'\n\n'Éké! We don't know all these questions that you ask,' said the little boys, because they were tired of the black man's questions and they wanted to admire the white man.\n\nThat day the white man said that he felt heat in his body-the old sickness that we all know. And Nzwango said, -\n\n'There is a great palaver house in the village with many doors. You must rest there.'\n\nBut when we came to the village there was no such palaver house, there were no palm trees in the middle of the street, and Nzwango could not find the path to the spring. A woman of the town brought us water, not such water, Nzwango said, as the women of the past used to bring from the old spring.\n\nThere was no one in the town who knew Nzwango, they were all people of another tribe. They told us that this was a new town, that the old clearing was left at the right hand; it was deserted.\n\nOur master slept in the middle of the day. Nzwango sat thinking the thoughts of a man in a deserted clearing.\n\nThat afternoon we passed the great rock. It is a great rock-as great as a great garden. No little thing finds root and grows there, only the rain stands in little pools where there is place. We wondered to see it so great, though we had heard many words of its greatness. And the mark of God's foot is certainly there-greater than a man's foot-and the little pointed mark of the goat's foot is there also.\n\nThe white man said, 'Since I was born I never saw the mark of God's foot,' and he looked at it. 'Very good,' he said. He sat upon the rock, for long he looked to where the sun went down its path to its setting. From that great rock you may look far every way.\n\nOf our company every man raised his voice in praise of the rock and of that strange thing-the mark of God's foot. Only Nzwango did not speak. He stood away by himself, all alone. The way he did not speak after so much speaking was the way the rain ceases on the roof. You wonder at that silence. Only when we were on the path again he spoke. He spoke to our white man about the rock and his speaking was the speaking of a man who meets grief.\n\n'My master,' he said, 'I am a man who hates a lie. The people of my town believe me when I return from hunting alone. And when I told you that Mbekom was a great rock I told you the truth-it was a great rock-not as you see it now, but exceedingly great. It was indeed white, as I told you-exceedingly white, so that the whiteness of it was not to be borne in the sunlight, and in the moonlight a great company has danced there to the sound of many drums. These things are true though it will trouble you to believe them. But it is when I speak of the mark of God's foot that I feel shame. For the mark of God's foot is not deep as it was; it is a little shallow trace like another.'\n\nThen the sound of Nzwango's voice ceased like the ceasing of rain.\n\nThe white man spoke good words of a good heart. I forget his words. Nzwango did not speak again, except to everyone we met. He asked each was he of the tribe that knew his father. None knew his father. It was the time of the setting of the sun when we came to Nkotoven. Nzwango built the cloth house for the white man. Our master did not eat, though the women of the town brought him much good food in wooden bowls spread with new leaves. The heat was great in his body. He slept, and I lay with Nzwango by the door of his house of cloth. We lay upon plantain leaves, and a little fire burned between us. Night was at the middle when the moon came up. In the moonlight people passed who were carrying loads from the sea.\n\nNzwango did not sleep; he asked all the carriers were they of that neighborhood and did they know his father. And it happened that there was an old woman with a load of alt who was born in his father's town. She was going to pass but Nzwango caught her by the ankle.\n\n'I ask you,' he said, 'was not Mbekom greater in the past?'\n\n'It was indeed greater. Many people used to dance there in the moonlight all the night to the sound of many drums.'\n\n'And was it not whiter?'\n\n'It was whiter-the whiteness of it was not to be borne in the time of great sunlight.'\n\n'And the mark of God's foot-was it not deeper?'\n\n'The mark of God's foot was deeper-the young cannot believe how deep that mark was.'\n\nNzwango rose and shouted with a great shout. He called our master at the door of the cloth house. 'Come quickly!' he told him, and the white man came quickly, his gun was in his hand, his body was wet with the sweat of his sickness.\n\n'What happens?' he asked Nzwango; and Nzwango spoke to him of the old woman who knew all the truth of the great rock.\n\n'Sit by the fire and she will tell you the truth-the truth is one with my truth-it is good that you should hear it.'\n\nOur master laid his gun upon the ground softly, softly. He sat on the plaintain leaves beside the fire. He bathed his hands in the warmth. When he spooke it was a soft speaking, eh did not look at us.\n\n'Go sleep in the palaver house,' he said.\n\n'But the old woman of my tribe will be gone in the morning,' said Nzwango, 'and it is good that you should hear her before she goes.'\n\nEven so the white man did not speak again. Strange thing-tears ran out of his eyes-I saw them in the moonlight. Presently he began to tremble with the cold of our old sickness. We felt grief in our hearts to see him so sick. Because he did not speak again we went away, the old woman, too. We trimmed the fire before we left. It was a bright night.\n\nNzwango said to me, 'Strange thing he had no words to ask of the old woman.'\n\n'It is his sickness,' I said. 'When I am sick with the heat and the cold I hate to see old women.'\n\nII. The Kettle\n\nThe time Ela lost the kettle we felt grief in our hearts. But we said any real person would have done the same. The white man gave the kettle to Ela the night before we began our walk to the big path.\n\nHe called us and he said, 'Show me your feet! They are good,' he said. 'The walk we are going is a long walk. We will cross the Nlong River and come to the big path. Many nights we will sleep by the way.'\n\nAnd he said, 'I know you. You must always be talking a kettle palaver-who will carry the kettle. I can never start out in the dawn but I must hear your voices loud about the kettle-your own kettle out of which you yourselves eat. Myself I will say Ela must carry the kettle. Not one man one day and another man the next, but Ela every day. And when we come to rest at night there will be the kettle as it should be.'\n\nSo it was that Ela carried the kettle.\n\nÉké! the trouble we saw those days when we walked to the big path! And the great thing it is-the big path! Since you were born you never saw such things. Tribes and tribes as many as the leaves of the forest, and each tribe after its kind like the trees of the forest. People carrying burdens and people walking free and people wearing things on their heads and things on their feet like a white man. White people on great beasts and white people on things that were not beasts though they breathed like a beast and like a beast they walked-you cannot know what I mean. We certainly were stunned to see the things we saw. And we were shamed at, the laughing people laughed at our loin-cloths of beaten bark. None but us on the big path worn that old thing of beaten bark. All wore the things bought of the white man. We felt shame. And none spoke our speech.\n\nWe said to the white man, 'It is well that you make haste for we will die on this big path. The sun shines upon us all day and we wither. We remember the shade of the forest.'\n\nWe did not say, 'Shame eats us,' for shame is a thing of the heart, and the white man's heart is the heart of a white man. But we said to him, 'It is well that you make haste.' And he said, 'In three days we will turn back to the forest.'\n\nWe saw black men with things on their heads like white men. And these black men had this custom: when they saw a white man they took these things off their heads. So we asked our white man, -\n\n'Why do they always take the things off their heads?'\n\nHe said, 'They do this to honor the white man. It is the custom.'\n\nAha! we thought in our hearts, it is the custom.\n\nThat is why Ela took the kettle off his head. He carried it always on his head in the morning and in the evening, for then the sun was not strong and this was the way he had said he would carry it in the morning and in the evening. He was carrying it so the day we met the white woman.\n\nThe white woman came on a beast. We saw her coming and we said, -\n\n'It is a question-what is this coming-it should be a white person-is it a child?'\n\nAnd our white man said, 'It is a woman.'\n\nSo we knew it was a woman.\n\nÉké! but little around the body! You would say no bigger than your wrist. Strange hair strangely dressed. All her little body covered with a cloth. Since you were born!\n\nOur white man left the middle of the path and where he stood he took the thing off his head. When the white woman came near he bent his body. They spoke together. How do we know what they said-do we know their speech? We stood stunned. Only Ela remembered the custom. He remembered that he must take the kettle off his head, and he did. He bent his body as our master had done.\n\nThe white woman saw this thing that I am telling you and when she saw it she laughed. Our white man saw it and he laughed.\n\nNow I ask you-why did they laugh? If it was the custom. We felt shame in our hearts for our brother. And when he stayed behind to break the kettle, not a man of our company hindered him. We said any real person would do the same. He broke it with rocks.\n\nThat night we baked our plantains in the ashes and said nothing. White people are strange. He never asked-where is the kettle? But he bought us another at the house of sale on the big path. We carried it as we pleased, one man one day and another man the next.\n\nOnly Ela never carried it.\n\nIII. The Day\n\nWhen our white man sickened, our chief went to him. It was night, and the white man sat out under the eaves. Osala said to him, -\n\n\"Tell us why you sicken. Is it the girl we gave you-has she poisoned your food?'\n\nThen the white man called the girl.\n\n'Give me to drink,' he said. Then she gave him to drink out of the gourd she carries to the spring. And Osala knew that it was not the girl. She was a young girl, very black, as slim as your wrist. The white man let her do as her heart desired, so she did not hate him. And Osala believed that it was not the girl.\n\n'Is it a witch, and who has given you the witch?' Osala asked the white man. And then was still. The little moon was red before Osala spoke again.\n\n'Our hearts are hanging up; tell us why you sicken.'\n\nThe white man said, 'I sicken for a day.'\n\n'The things of the white man are strange,' said Osala. And he went away.\n\nThen was the time of the great sunlight. Through every breach in the forest the sun was strong. In the clearing before the white man's house the green things died and his thatch rustled always with the heat.\n\nIt is for a day of rain that he sickens, we thought. But when the stars that warn us of the great rains stood above the roof and the rains fell upon the thatch like quick hands upon a drum-even then our white man sickened. He would not come out to bargain for rubber. He would not come for the great tusks of ivory as thick as a man's thigh and as high as his shoulder. Then we knew that it was not for a day of rain that our white man sickened. And we said to Osala, 'Go and ask him for what he sickens,'\n\n'Am I a maker of days?' Osala said. But he went.\n\nThey sat again under the eaves at the close of day. The girl brought Osala a little fish baked in a leaf, but he did not eat it. He asked our white man, 'You say it is for a day that you sicken. Tell us for what day. Our hearts are hanging up.'\n\nAnd the white man said, 'Every man has hidden in his heart a day for which he sickens. My day is hidden in my heart. Are you a maker of days that you should heal me? Eat of the baked fish; it is good, and the little girl grieves that none eat of her baking.'\n\nWe never spoke to our white man again of his sickness. And he died. We buried him after the custom of our tribe; we did not know the custom of his country. We danced for many days, and the songs we sang were the songs of mourning.\n\nThe thatch above his house is thin-the sun and the rain go in. But all his tusks are as he left them. And we have kept the little girl to do with as you will. Since her master died she has sat in the ashes, she has not anointed her body with oil. Thus we have kept her and have not given her in marriage until the day when the brothers of the white man should come up from the sea to do with her as they will.\n\nYou may say that she poisoned his food. Or that some secret evil was cast upon him.\n\nBut he said to Osala under the eaves of his house that he sickened for a day. 'All men,' he said, 'have a day hidden in their hearts and mine is hidden in my heart.'\n\nWere we makers of days that we should heal him?"

      "text": "The Red Man and the White Man\n\nTHE title of Dr. Ellis's important work on the Indians 1 intimates the exclusion of one subject which just now engages the attention of scientific historians. Dr. Ellis does not concern himself with archæological questions ; he makes no pretense of determining the origin of the red man on this continent, nor does he examine the materials for determining the condition of the Indian before he came into contact with the European ; the mound-builders and the pueblo Indians are dismissed in a sentence. His interest is not that of a scientist, but of a social and political philosopher, and his book appeals thus to the widest class.\n\nThe method which Dr. Ellis uses is mainly topical, although in his arrangement of topics he follows as nearly as may be a chronological order; but since his purpose is chiefly to make the facts about the relation of the red man to the white man throw light upon the still unsolved problem of that relation as it regards the public policy of the United States, the conclusions which he reaches are repeatedly foreshadowed. To obtain his facts he was obliged to make a patient and much-enduring examination of a vast body of literature regarding the Indian, and he has systematized his knowledge without troubling the reader with too close a statement of his separate authorities. If Dr. Ellis's book were a history, one might object to the absence of foot-notes ; it is not a history, but a discussion and a practical essay ; the conclusions reached are the judgments of years of study, and we think the author chose wisely in resting his arguments upon the clearness of his own statements, rather than upon an array of fortifying authorities. In point of fact, there can scarcely be such a thing as a scientific presentation of this subject. The personal equation is so great and so varied that its elimination or its measurement is practically impossible. It is of very much more importance to know what a diligent student, an honorable and just judge, a wise citizen, bred in the best schools of thought, thinks about the Indian question, and all these conditions meet in Dr. Ellis.\n\nAfter a general and superficial survey of the field, he recites the story of the relations held to the red man by the Spanish discoverers and invaders; and then, since the Spaniard disappears from the field, - for Dr. Ellis hardly refers to Mexico, his business being with the roving tribes, - he proceeds to draw a picture of Indian life as it has appeared to the French and English since their permanent residence here and intercourse with the aborigines. He treats of the personal characteristics of the Indian, his condition, his resources and surroundings ; and if it be objected that this assumes a stationary quality in the Indian, it may be answered that one of the strong points made by Dr. Ellis is in the substantial identity of the Indian seen by the first settlers and the Indian seen by the frontiersmen to-day ; the unimprovability of the savage when in contact with the white man is made to be one of the few facts established by history.\n\nHaving sketched the Indian, Dr. Ellis enters upon an interesting and valuable inquiry into his tenure of land as viewed by European invaders and colonists. The confusion attending the subject is a further illustration of the utter incompatibility of savage and civilized views as to real estate. The way is thus open for a more strictly narrative portion, in which he relates successively the intercourse of the French and the Indians, the colonial relations, missionary efforts among them, both by Romanists and Protestants; and then the comparative relations of Great Britain and the United States with the Indians, in which he disposes with admirable candor of the specious plea that Great Britain has pursued a policy resulting in amity, and the United States one issuing only in war. He makes, by the way, a shrewd suggestion of the possible complications which may arise in the future from the passage of disaffected Indians back and forth across the Northwestern frontier. One further chapter, upon the military and peace policy with the Indians, brings him to the conclusion, in which results partially anticipated are summed up in the discussion of the Indians under civilization.\n\nOf the general treatment \"which is thus outlined we can make no complaint; in two particulars only do we think the author falls short of his subject. The comparison of Romanist and Protestant missions is based almost exclusively upon a consideration of the Jesuits in Canada and of John Eliot in Massachusetts. There is an advantage in this from the well-sifted historical material which exists, and because the remoteness in time excludes partisanship ; but as a contribution toward a solution of existing problems we should have been better pleased if inquiry had been made into the vigorous Christian movements on the frontier. The relation of the Praying Indians to King Philip's war is of faint interest beside the part borne by Christian converts in relation to the Sioux massacre in Minnesota.\n\nAgain, there is a serious omission in a failure to recount the experiments of self-government in the Indian Territory. There ought to be a good deal of material here for use in determining some of the problems connected with the Indian question, and, above all, some light might be thrown upon that fundamental problem of the tribe. Dr. Ellis, we think, assumes too readily the necessary extinction of the tribal relation in any settlement of the Indian question. He sees, as is so readily apparent, the incompatibility of the tribe with citizenship, but does he recognize the profound significance of the tribe as an elemental property in Indian life ? We talk glibly of severalty possession, but if the Indian were to Indianize us he would probably fail to understand our creed of individuality.\n\nDr. Ellis, even in his last chapter, does not explicitly and deliberately outline an Indian policy. He is too wise to propose a panacea, but by his admirable statement of the questions at issue he half answers them. He faces, fairly and squarely, the alternative of extermination and civilization, and does not flinch from reciting all the facts which bear so heavily in favor of the former course; but, in spite of the generations of failure which he has been obliged to record, he ranks himself with the undaunted but not blind adherents of the better way. He believes that a great advance was made when the government committed itself to a policy which regards the Indians as wards of the nation, and not sovereign powers ; much of the contradiction which has marked previous relations will, he thinks, disappear under this clearer and more rational attitude. He contends strongly and with reason against a policy which pauperizes the Indian, and he recognizes with moderate but hopeful regard the experiments at Hampton and Carlisle. We wish he might have found it in his way to discuss two important questions: the proximate disappearance of game, upon which the hunting Indian depends, and the possibility of transforming the hunter into a herdsman.\n\nDr. Ellis's contribution, however, is rather in his orderly collection, of facts and views, and his illumination of the problem by his statement of the points under consideration, than in a detailed, formal, and pragmatical scheme for settling what is, after all, one of those questions which command the broadest statesmanship, but lie beyond the definite control of executive organization. The most significant sentence in the book, and the best exposition of Dr. Ellis's creed, is the final one, and it will linger long in the reader's mind : - \"The Indians seem now to have become aliens in the land of their nativity. There is one ray of possible hopefulness for them, and with such cheer as it may afford we may close the review of their sad history. ... It is that the race may soon present to us one or more specimens of truly great and wise men, patriots, civilians, of lofty minds, pure aims, with the faculty of quickening, guiding, and inspiring their fellows, lifting them and leading them onward. It will be well, too, if such a man or such men may be of pure Indian blood, of unmixed native stock, with the virility and the nobleness of a wilderness birth, and that he accept without shame -ay, glory in - the tinge of his race. . . . We have had a few of the Indian race whom, by our standards, we call able, gitted. great. They have, indeed, been few. We may count them for the centuries on one hand, - five. But all of these foremost Indian chieftains - Philip, Pontiac, Tecumseh, Osceola, Black Hawk - have represented savagery, have stood and fought for savagery. They have all been familiar with what civilization is and does; but they have loathed it, despised it, rejected it, and given their whole power and sway to forbid and crush it. Now may not this native greatness, this leadership of men, manifest itself in a few gifted with genius, nobly endowed, patriots in spirit, yet horn or self-trained to a conviction that civilization is for man a state preferable to that of savagery ? The elevation, if not the security from extinction, of the race of red men depends upon its furnishing masters and guides from its stock. A race that cannot itself contribute its redeemers will never be redeemed.\"\n\nThis will be pondered, for it is weighty. Nevertheless, without excluding this view, the hope which offers it may add the conjecture that not one great leader, but a number of humble men and women, with all the qualities of wise conduct, may silently but effectively work a change in the condition of their race. The view which contemplates a personal redemption is impregnable.\n\nWe may, at all events, express our obligation to Dr. Ellis for such a presentation of the entire subject as ought to make it possible for reading people to have juster opinions. We can assure our readers, besides, that the book need not be taken up as a task. The thorough assimilation of his material has enabled the author to reproduce it almost as if it were original, and the soundness of his judgment has ordered a style which is refreshingly clear and direct. One may sometimes be a little impatient at the leisureliness of the author's movements, and wish that some of the repetitions had been omitted; but with this easy manner comes now and then a good-humored passage, which is worth waiting for, and a shrewdness of observation and comment which has all the effectiveness of wit, as where, for example, he looks at civilization from the savage's point of view. Mr. Parkman, to whom Dr. Ellis confesses his obligation. has written with greater detail, and is our finest authority for most phases of Indian life; but Dr. Ellis has rounded our knowledge in a work which will do much to establish just and comprehensive views."

      "text": "The White Man's Continent\n\nShout-out to whoever it was that told me to check out Eric Hobsbawm's The Age of Revolution . I am really digging it. For people like me--black dudes who like European history--one of the really unfortunate things is the inability to consider Europe on its own human terms. European history was always presented to us in the manner of a victorious football team spiking the ball in your face. If you accept the logic of racism--that skin color really does correspond to something deep and meaningful--and you are black and care about history, you wind up spending much of your time searching for reasons why white people are savages and you are not. This is especially true if you don't actually know much about African history.\n\nIn that way, Europe becomes \"white people's property.\" You only look at the continent and its history in the hopes of mining ammo to lob at your enemy. You don't really find World War II interesting for the story, so much as you find the Nazis the logical apex of the White Man's Civilization. You can't really think about, say, Garibaldi or Descartes or Hobbes or Marx. Basically all you want to know is did they hate black people, or not.\n\nThis is why (again) Ralph Wiley's \"Tolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus\" meant so much to me and my intellectual development. It was the liberation of humanism. (It's so interesting to me that the Russians themselves have long only barely qualified as civilized and \"European.\") It's not so much that culture doesn't exist or that Newton's country is irrelevant to understanding him. It's that culture is not mystical. Culture is not a euphemism for \"I am innately more awesome than you.\"\n\nHobsbawm's two main subjects are the Industrial Revolution and The French Revolution. He makes the case, very early in the book, that where these two revolutions happened mattered and that it's very difficult to imagine them happening anywhere else. But Hobsbawm--like any good historian--isn't writing nationalist triumphalism. One of the most freeing experiences for me over the past few years has been the freedom to dig into this stuff simply because I think it's cool."

      "text": "'This Is How We Lost to the White Man'\n\nThe audacity of Bill Cosby's black conservatism\n\nLast summer, in Detroit's St. Paul Church of God in Christ, I watched Bill Cosby summon his inner Malcolm X. It was a hot July evening. Cosby was speaking to an audience of black men dressed in everything from Enyce T-shirts or polos to blazers and ties. Some were there with their sons. Some were there in wheelchairs. The audience was packed tight, rows of folding chairs extended beyond the wooden pews to capture the overflow. But the chairs were not enough, and late arrivals stood against the long shotgun walls, or out in the small lobby, where they hoped to catch a snatch of Cosby's oratory. Clutching a cordless mic, Cosby paced the front of the church, shifting between prepared remarks and comic ad-libs. A row of old black men, community elders, sat behind him, nodding and grunting throaty affirmations. The rest of the church was in full call-and-response mode, punctuating Cosby's punch lines with laughter, applause, or cries of \"Teach, black man! Teach!\"\n\nHe began with the story of a black girl who'd risen to become valedictorian of his old high school, despite having been abandoned by her father. \"She spoke to the graduating class and her speech started like this,\" Cosby said. \"'I was 5 years old. It was Saturday and I stood looking out the window, waiting for him.' She never said what helped turn her around. She never mentioned her mother, grandmother, or great-grandmother.\"\n\n\"Understand me,\" Cosby said, his face contorted and clenched like a fist. \"Men? Men? Men! Where are you, men?\"\n\nAudience: \"Right here!\"\n\nCosby had come to Detroit aiming to grab the city's black men by their collars and shake them out of the torpor that has left so many of them-like so many of their peers across the country-undereducated, over-incarcerated, and underrepresented in the ranks of active fathers. No women were in the audience. No reporters were allowed, for fear that their presence might frighten off fathers behind on their child-support payments. But I was there, trading on race, gender, and a promise not to interview any of the allegedly skittish participants.\n\n\"Men, if you want to win, we can win,\" Cosby said. \"We are not a pitiful race of people. We are a bright race, who can move with the best. But we are in a new time, where people are behaving in abnormal ways and calling it normal ... When they used to come into our neighborhoods, we put the kids in the basement, grabbed a rifle, and said, 'By any means necessary.'\n\n\"I don't want to talk about hatred of these people,\" he continued. \"I'm talking about a time when we protected our women and protected our children. Now I got people in wheelchairs, paralyzed. A little girl in Camden, jumping rope, shot through the mouth. Grandmother saw it out the window. And people are waiting around for Jesus to come, when Jesus is already within you.\"\n\nCosby was wearing his standard uniform-dark sunglasses, loafers, a sweat suit emblazoned with the seal of an institution of higher learning. That night it was the University of Massachusetts, where he'd gotten his doctorate in education 30 years ago. He was preaching from the book of black self-reliance, a gospel that he has spent the past four years carrying across the country in a series of events that he bills as \"call-outs.\" \"My problem,\" Cosby told the audience, \"is I'm tired of losing to white people. When I say I don't care about white people, I mean let them say what they want to say. What can they say to me that's worse than what their grandfather said?\"\n\nFrom Birmingham to Cleveland and Baltimore, at churches and colleges, Cosby has been telling thousands of black Americans that racism in America is omnipresent but that it can't be an excuse to stop striving. As Cosby sees it, the antidote to racism is not rallies, protests, or pleas, but strong families and communities. Instead of focusing on some abstract notion of equality, he argues, blacks need to cleanse their culture, embrace personal responsibility, and reclaim the traditions that fortified them in the past. Driving Cosby's tough talk about values and responsibility is a vision starkly different from Martin Luther King's gauzy, all-inclusive dream: it's an America of competing powers, and a black America that is no longer content to be the weakest of the lot.\n\nIt's heady stuff, especially coming from the man white America remembers as a sitcom star and affable pitchman for E. F. Hutton, Kodak, and Jell-O Pudding Pops. And Cosby's race-based crusade is particularly jarring now. Across the country, as black politics has become more professionalized, the rhetoric of race is giving way to the rhetoric of standards and results. Newark's young Ivy League-educated mayor, Cory Booker, ran for office promising competence and crime reduction, as did Washington's mayor, Adrian Fenty. Indeed, we are now enjoying a moment of national self-congratulation over racial progress, with a black man running for president as the very realization of King's dream. Barack Obama defied efforts by the Clinton campaign to pigeonhole him as a \"black\" candidate, casting himself instead as the symbol of a society that has moved beyond lazy categories of race.\n\nBlack America does not entirely share the euphoria, though. The civil-rights generation is exiting the American stage-not in a haze of nostalgia but in a cloud of gloom, troubled by the persistence of racism, the apparent weaknesses of the generation following in its wake, and the seeming indifference of much of the country to black America's fate. In that climate, Cosby's gospel of discipline, moral reform, and self-reliance offers a way out-a promise that one need not cure America of its original sin in order to succeed. Racism may not be extinguished, but it can be beaten.\n\nHas Dr. Huxtable, the head of one of America's most beloved television households, seen the truth: that the dream of integration should never supplant the pursuit of self-respect; that blacks should worry more about judging themselves and less about whether whites are judging them on the content of their character? Or has he lost his mind?\n\nFrom the moment he registered in the American popular consciousness, as the Oxford-educated Alexander Scott in the NBC adventure series I Spy , Cosby proffered the idea of an America that transcended race. The series, which started in 1965, was the first weekly show to feature an African American in a lead role, but it rarely factored race into dialogue or plots. Race was also mostly inconspicuous in Cosby's performances as a hugely popular stand-up comedian. \"I don't spend my hours worrying how to slip a social message into my act,\" Cosby told Playboy in 1969. He also said that he didn't \"have time to sit around and worry whether all the black people of the world make it because of me. I have my own gig to worry about.\" His crowning artistic and commercial achievement- The Cosby Show , which ran from 1984 to 1992-was seemingly a monument to that understated sensibility.\n\nIn fact, blackness was never absent from the show or from Bill Cosby. Plots involved black artists like Stevie Wonder or Dizzy Gillespie. The Huxtables' home was decorated with the works of black artists like Annie Lee, and the show featured black theater veterans such as Roscoe Lee Brown and Moses Gunn. Behind the scenes, Cosby hired the Harvard psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint to make sure that the show never trafficked in stereotypes and that it depicted blacks in a dignified light. Picking up Cosby's fixation on education, Poussaint had writers insert references to black schools. \"If the script mentioned Oberlin, Texas Tech, or Yale, we'd circle it and tell them to mention a black college,\" Poussaint told me in a phone interview last year. \"I remember going to work the next day and white people saying, 'What's the school called Morehouse?'\" In 1985, Cosby riled NBC by placing an anti-apartheid sign in his Huxtable son's bedroom. The network wanted no part of the debate. \"There may be two sides to apartheid in Archie Bunker's house,\" the Toronto Star quoted Cosby as saying . \"But it's impossible that the Huxtables would be on any side but one. That sign will stay on that door. And I've told NBC that if they still want it down, or if they try to edit it out, there will be no show.\" The sign stayed.\n\nOffstage, Cosby's philanthropy won him support among the civil-rights crowd. He made his biggest splash in 1988, when he and his wife gave $20 million to Spelman College, the largest individual donation ever given to a black college. \"Two million would have been fantastic; 20 million, to use the language of the hip-hop generation, was off the chain,\" says Johnnetta Cole, who was then president of Spelman. Race again came to the fore in 1997, when Cosby's son was randomly shot and killed while fixing a flat on a Los Angeles freeway. His wife wrote an op-ed in USA Today arguing that white racism lay behind her son's death. \"All African-Americans, regardless of their educational and economic accomplishments, have been and are at risk in America simply because of their skin colors,\" she wrote. \"Most people know that facing the truth brings about healing and growth. When is America going to face its historical and current racial realities so it can be what it says it is?\"\n\nThe column caused a minor row, but most of white America took little notice. To them, Cosby was still America's Dad. But those close to Cosby were not surprised. Cosby was an avowed race man, who, like much of his generation, had come to feel that black America had lost its way. The crisis of absentee fathers, the rise of black-on-black crime, and the spread of hip-hop all led Cosby to believe that, after the achievements of the 1960s, the black community was committing cultural suicide.\n\nHis anger and frustration erupted into public view during an NAACP awards ceremony in Washington in 2004 commemorating the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education . At that moment, the shades of mortality and irrelevance seemed to be drawing over the civil-rights generation. Its matriarchs, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King, would be dead within two years. The NAACP's membership rolls had been shrinking; within months, its president, Kweisi Mfume, would resign (it was later revealed that he was under investigation by the NAACP for sexual harassment and nepotism-allegations that he denied). Other movement leaders were drifting into self-parody: Al Sharpton would soon be hosting a reality show and, a year later, would be doing ads for a predatory loan company; Sharpton and Jesse Jackson had recently asked MGM to issue an apology for the hit movie Barbershop .\n\nThat night, Cosby was one of the last honorees to take the podium. He began by noting that although civil-rights activists had opened the door for black America, young people today, instead of stepping through, were stepping backward. \"No longer is a person embarrassed because they're pregnant without a husband,\" he told the crowd. \"No longer is a boy considered an embarrassment if he tries to run away from being the father of the unmarried child.\"\n\nThere was cheering as Cosby went on. Perhaps sensing that he had the crowd, he grew looser. \"The lower-economic and lower-middle-economic people are not holding their end in this deal,\" he told the audience.\n\nCosby disparaged activists who charge the criminal-justice system with racism. \"These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake,\" Cosby said. \"Then we all run out and are outraged: 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said, 'If you get caught with it, you're going to embarrass your mother.'\"\n\nThen he attacked African American naming traditions, and the style of dress among young blacks: \"Ladies and gentlemen, listen to these people. They are showing you what's wrong ... What part of Africa did this come from? We are not Africans. Those people are not Africans. They don't know a damned thing about Africa- with names like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed, and all that crap, and all of them are in jail.\" About then, people began to walk out of the auditorium and cluster in the lobby. There was still cheering, but some guests milled around and wondered what had happened. Some thought old age had gotten the best of Cosby. The mood was one of shock.\n\nAfter what has come to be known as \"the Pound Cake speech\"-it has its own Wikipedia entry -Cosby came under attack from various quarters of the black establishment. The playwright August Wilson commented, \"A billionaire attacking poor people for being poor. Bill Cosby is a clown. What do you expect?\" One of the gala's hosts, Ted Shaw, the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, called his comments \"a harsh attack on poor black people in particular.\" Dubbing Cosby an \"Afristocrat in Winter,\" the Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson came out with a book, Is Bill Cosby Right? Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind? , that took issue with Cosby's bleak assessment of black progress and belittled his transformation from vanilla humorist to social critic and moral arbiter. \"While Cosby took full advantage of the civil rights struggle,\" argued Dyson, \"he resolutely denied it a seat at his artistic table.\"\n\nBut Cosby's rhetoric played well in black barbershops, churches, and backyard barbecues, where a unique brand of conservatism still runs strong. Outsiders may have heard haranguing in Cosby's language and tone. But much of black America heard instead the possibility of changing their communities without having to wait on the consciences and attention spans of policy makers who might not have their interests at heart. Shortly after Cosby took his Pound Cake message on the road, I wrote an article denouncing him as an elitist. When my father, a former Black Panther, read it, he upbraided me for attacking what he saw as a message of black empowerment. Cosby's argument has resonated with the black mainstream for just that reason.\n\nThe split between Cosby and critics such as Dyson mirrors not only America's broader conservative/liberal split but black America's own historic intellectual divide. Cosby's most obvious antecedent is Booker T. Washington. At the turn of the 20th century, Washington married a defense of the white South with a call for black self-reliance and became the most prominent black leader of his day. He argued that southern whites should be given time to adjust to emancipation; in the meantime, blacks should advance themselves not by voting and running for office but by working, and ultimately owning, the land.\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois, the integrationist model for the Dysons of our day, saw Washington as an apologist for white racism and thought that his willingness to sacrifice the black vote was heretical. History ultimately rendered half of Washington's argument moot. His famous Atlanta Compromise-in which he endorsed segregation as a temporary means of making peace with southerners-was answered by lynchings, land theft, and general racial terrorism. But Washington's appeal to black self-sufficiency endured.\n\nAfter Washington's death, in 1915, the black conservative tradition he had fathered found a permanent and natural home in the emerging ideology of Black Nationalism. Marcus Garvey, its patron saint, turned the Atlanta Compromise on its head, implicitly endorsing segregation not as an olive branch to whites but as a statement of black supremacy. Black Nationalists scorned the Du Boisian integrationists as stooges or traitors, content to beg for help from people who hated them.\n\nGarvey argued that blacks had rendered themselves unworthy of the white man's respect. \"The greatest stumbling block in the way of progress in the race has invariably come from within the race itself,\" wrote Garvey. \"The monkey wrench of destruction as thrown into the cog of Negro Progress, is not thrown so much by the outsider as by the very fellow who is in our fold, and who should be the first to grease the wheel of progress rather than seeking to impede.\" Decades later, Malcolm X echoed that sentiment, faulting blacks for failing to take charge of their destinies. \"The white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community,\" Malcolm said. \"But you will let anybody come in and take control of the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses, under the pretext that you want to integrate. No, you're out of your mind.\"\n\nBlack conservatives like Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, have at times allied themselves with black liberals. But in general, they have upheld a core of beliefs laid out by Garvey almost a century ago: a skepticism of (white) government as a mediating force in the \"Negro problem,\" a strong belief in the singular will of black people, and a fixation on a supposedly glorious black past.\n\nThose beliefs also animate Come On People , the manifesto that Cosby and Poussaint published last fall. Although it does not totally dismiss government programs, the book mostly advocates solutions from within as a cure for black America's dismal vital statistics. \"Once we find our bearings,\" they write, \"we can move forward, as we have always done, on the path from victims to victors.\" Come On People is heavy on black pride (\"no group of people has had the impact on the culture of the whole world that African Americans have had, and much of that impact has been for the good\"), and heavier on the idea of the Great Fall-the theory, in this case, that post-Jim Crow blacks have lost touch with the cultural traditions that enabled them to persevere through centuries of oppression.\n\n\"For all the woes of segregation, there were some good things to come out of it,\" Cosby and Poussaint write. \"One was that it forced us to take care of ourselves. When restaurants, laundries, hotels, theaters, groceries, and clothing stores were segregated, black people opened and ran their own. Black life insurance companies and banks thrived, as well as black funeral homes ... Such successes provided jobs and strength to black economic well-being. They also gave black people that gratifying sense of an interdependent community.\" Although the authors take pains to put some distance between themselves and the Nation of Islam, they approvingly quote one of its ministers who spoke at a call-out in Compton, California: \"I went to Koreatown today and I met with the Korean merchants,\" the minister told the crowd. \"I love them. You know why? They got a place called what? Koreatown. When I left them, I went to Chinatown. They got a place called what? Chinatown. Where is your town?\"\n\nThe notion of the Great Fall, and the attendant theory that segregation gave rise to some \"good things,\" are the stock-in-trade of what Christopher Alan Bracey, a law professor at Washington University, calls (in his book, Saviors or Sellouts ) the \"organic\" black conservative tradition: conservatives who favor hard work and moral reform over protests and government intervention, but whose black-nationalist leanings make them anathema to the Heritage Foundation and Rush Limbaugh. When political strategists argue that the Republican Party is missing a huge chance to court the black community, they are thinking of this mostly male bloc-the old guy in the barbershop, the grizzled Pop Warner coach, the retired Vietnam vet, the drunk uncle at the family reunion. He votes Democratic, not out of any love for abortion rights or progressive taxation, but because he feels-in fact, he knows-that the modern-day GOP draws on the support of people who hate him. This is the audience that flocks to Cosby: culturally conservative black Americans who are convinced that integration, and to some extent the entire liberal dream, robbed them of their natural defenses.\n\n\"There are things that we did not see coming,\" Cosby told me over lunch in Manhattan last year. \"Like, you could see the Klan, but because these things were not on a horse, because there was no white sheet, and the people doing the deed were not white, we saw things in the light of family and forgiveness ... We didn't pay attention to the dropout rate. We didn't pay attention to the fathers, to the self-esteem of our boys.\"\n\nGiven the state of black America, it is hard to quarrel with that analysis. Blacks are 13 percent of the population, yet black men account for 49 percent of America's murder victims and 41 percent of the prison population. The teen birth rate for blacks is 63 per 1,000, more than double the rate for whites. In 2005, black families had the lowest median income of any ethnic group measured by the Census, making only 61 percent of the median income of white families.\n\nMost troubling is a recent study released by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which concluded that the rate at which blacks born into the middle class in the 1960s backslid into poverty or near-poverty (45 percent) was three times that of whites-suggesting that the advances of even some of the most successful cohorts of black America remain tenuous at best. Another Pew survey, released last November, found that blacks were \"less upbeat about the state of black progress now than at any time since 1983.\"\n\nThe rise of the organic black conservative tradition is also a response to America's retreat from its second attempt at Reconstruction. Blacks have watched as the courts have weakened affirmative action, arguably the country's greatest symbol of state-sponsored inclusion. They've seen a fraudulent war on drugs that, judging by the casualties, looks like a war on black people. They've seen themselves bandied about as playthings in the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan (with his 1980 invocation of states' rights\" in Mississippi), George Bush (Willie Horton), Bill Clinton (Sister Souljah), and George W. Bush (McCain's fabled black love-child). They've seen the utter failures of school busing and housing desegregation, as well as the horrors of Katrina. The result is a broad distrust of government as the primary tool for black progress.\n\nIn May 2004, just one day before Cosby's Pound Cake speech, The New York Times visited Louisville, Kentucky, once ground zero in the fight to integrate schools. But The Times found that sides had switched, and that black parents were more interested in educational progress than in racial parity. \"Integration? What was it good for?\" one parent asked. \"They were just setting up our babies to fail.\"\n\nIn response to these perceived failures, many black activists have turned their efforts inward. Geoffrey Canada's ambitious Harlem Children's Zone project pushes black students to change their study habits and improve their home life. In cities like Baltimore and New York, community groups are focusing on turning black men into active fathers. In Philadelphia last October, thousands of black men packed the Liacouras Center, pledging to patrol their neighborhoods and help combat the rising murder rate. When Cosby came to St. Paul Church in Detroit, one local judge got up and urged Cosby and other black celebrities to donate more money to advance the cause. \"I didn't fly out here to write a check,\" Cosby retorted. \"I'm not writing a check in Houston, Detroit, or Philadelphia. Leave these athletes alone. All you know is Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jackson. Forget about a check ... This is how we lost to the white man. 'Judge said Bill Cosby is gonna write a check, but until then ... '\"\n\nInstead of waiting for handouts or outside help, Cosby argues, disadvantaged blacks should start by purging their own culture of noxious elements like gangsta rap, a favorite target. \"What do record producers think when they churn out that gangsta rap with antisocial, women-hating messages?,\" Cosby and Poussaint ask in their book. \"Do they think that black male youth won't act out what they have repeated since they were old enough to listen?\" Cosby's rhetoric on culture echoes-and amplifies-a swelling strain of black opinion: last November's Pew study reported that 71 percent of blacks feel that rap is a bad influence.\n\nThe strain of black conservatism that Cosby evokes has also surfaced in the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. Early on, some commentators speculated that Obama's Cosby-esque appeals to personal responsibility would cost him black votes. But if his admonishments for black kids to turn off the PlayStation and for black fathers to do their jobs did him any damage, it was not reflected at the polls. In fact, this sort of rhetoric amounts to something of a racial double play, allowing Obama and Cosby to cater both to culturally conservative blacks and to whites who are convinced that black America is a bastion of decadence. (Curiously, Cosby is noncommittal verging on prickly when it comes to Obama. When Larry King asked him whether he supported Obama, he bristled: \"Do you ask white people this question? ... I want to know why this fellow especially is brought up in such a special way. How many Americans in the media really take him seriously, or do they look at him like some prize brown baby?\" The exchange ended with Cosby professing admiration for Dennis Kucinich. Months later, he rebuffed my requests for his views on Obama's candidacy.)\n\nThe shift in focus from white racism to black culture is not as new as some social commentators make it out to be. Standing in St. Paul Church on that July evening listening to Cosby, I remembered the last time The Street felt like this: in the summer of 1994, after Louis Farrakhan announced the Million Man March. Farrakhan barnstormed the country holding \"men only\" meetings (but much larger). I saw him in my native Baltimore, while home from Howard University on vacation. The march itself was cathartic. I walked with four or five other black men, and all along the way black women stood on porches or out on the street, shouting, clapping, cheering. For us, Farrakhan's opinions on the Jews mostly seemed beside the point; what stuck was the chance to assert our humanity and our manhood by marching on the Mall, and not acting like we were all fresh out of San Quentin. We lived in the shadow of the '80s crack era. So many of us had been jailed or were on our way. So many of us were fathers in biology only. We believed ourselves disgraced and clung to the march as a public statement: the time had come to grow up.\n\nBlack conservatives have been dipping into this well of lost black honor since the turn of the 20th century. On the one hand, vintage black nationalists have harked back to a golden age of black Africa, where mighty empires sprawled and everyone was a king. Meanwhile, populist black conservatives like Cosby point to pre-1968 black America as an era when blacks were united in the struggle: men were men, and a girl who got pregnant without getting married would find herself bundled off to Grandpa's farm.\n\nWhat both visions share is a sense that black culture in its present form is bastardized and pathological. What they also share is a foundation in myth. Black people are not the descendants of kings. We are-and I say this with big pride-the progeny of slaves. If there's any majesty in our struggle, it lies not in fairy tales but in those humble origins and the great distance we've traveled since. Ditto for the dreams of a separate but noble past. Cosby's, and much of black America's, conservative analysis flattens history and smooths over the wrinkles that have characterized black America since its inception.\n\nIndeed, a century ago, the black brain trust was pushing the same rhetoric that Cosby is pushing today. It was concerned that slavery had essentially destroyed the black family and was obsessed with seemingly the same issues-crime, wanton sexuality, and general moral turpitude-that Cosby claims are recent developments. \"The early effort of middle-class blacks to respond to segregation was, aside from a political agenda, focused on a social-reform agenda,\" says Khalil G. Muhammad, a professor of American history at Indiana University. \"The National Association of Colored Women, Du Bois in The Philadelphia Negro , all shared a sense of anxiety that African Americans were not presenting their best selves to the world. There was the sense that they were committing crimes and needed to keep their sexuality in check.\" Adds William Jelani Cobb, a professor of American history at Spelman College: \"The same kind of people who were advocating for social reform were denigrating people because they didn't play piano. They often saw themselves as reluctant caretakers of the less enlightened.\"\n\nIn particular, Cosby's argument-that much of what haunts young black men originates in post-segregation black culture-doesn't square with history. As early as the 1930s, sociologists were concerned that black men were falling behind black women. In his classic study, The Negro Family in the United States , published in 1939, E. Franklin Frazier argued that urbanization was undermining the ability of men to provide for their families. In 1965-at the height of the civil-rights movement-Daniel Patrick Moynihan's milestone report, \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" picked up the same theme.\n\nAt times, Cosby seems willfully blind to the parallels between his arguments and those made in the presumably glorious past. Consider his problems with rap. How could an avowed jazz fanatic be oblivious to the similar plaints once sparked by the music of his youth? \"The tired longshoreman, the porter, the housemaid and the poor elevator boy in search of recreation, seeking in jazz the tonic for weary nerves and muscles,\" wrote the lay historian J. A. Rogers, \"are only too apt to find the bootlegger, the gambler and the demi-monde who have come there for victims and to escape the eyes of the police.\"\n\nBeyond the apocryphal notion that black culture was once a fount of virtue, there's still the charge that culture is indeed the problem. But to reach that conclusion, you'd have to stand on some rickety legs. The hip-hop argument, again, is particularly creaky. Ronald Ferguson, a Harvard social scientist, has highlighted that an increase in hip-hop's popularity during the early 1990s corresponded with a declining amount of time spent reading among black kids. But gangsta rap can be correlated with other phenomena, too-many of them positive. During the 1990s, as gangsta rap exploded, teen pregnancy and the murder rate among black men declined. Should we give the blue ribbon in citizenship to Dr. Dre?\n\n\"I don't know how to measure culture. I don't know how to test its effects, and I'm not sure anyone else does,\" says the Georgetown economist Harry Holzer. \"There's a liberal story that limited opportunities, and barriers, lead to employment problems and criminal records, but then there's another story that has to do with norms, behaviors, and oppositional culture. You can't prove the latter statistically, but it still might be true.\" Holzer thinks that both arguments contain truth and that one doesn't preclude the other. Fair enough. Suffice it to say, though, that the evidence supporting structural inequality is compelling. In 2001, a researcher sent out black and white job applicants in Milwaukee, randomly assigning them a criminal record. The researcher concluded that a white man with a criminal record had about the same chance of getting a job as a black man without one. Three years later, researchers produced the same results in New York under more-rigorous conditions.\n\nThe accepted wisdom is that such studies are a comfort to black people, allowing them to wallow in their misery. In fact, the opposite is true-the liberal notion that blacks are still, after a century of struggle, victims of pervasive discrimination is the ultimate collective buzz-kill. It effectively means that African Americans must, on some level, accept that their children will be \"less than\" until some point in the future when white racism miraculously abates. That's not the sort of future that any black person eagerly awaits, nor does it make for particularly motivating talking points.\n\nLast summer, I watched Cosby give a moving commencement speech to a group of Connecticut inmates who'd just received their GEDs. Before the speech, at eight in the morning, Cosby quizzed correctional officials on the conditions and characteristics of their inmate population. I wished, then, that my 7-year-old son could have seen Cosby there, to take in the same basic message that I endeavor to serve him every day-that manhood means more than virility and strut, that it calls for discipline and dutiful stewardship. That the ultimate fate of black people lies in their own hands, not in the hands of their antagonists. That as an African American, he has a duty to his family, his community, and his ancestors.\n\nIf Cosby's call-outs simply ended at that-a personal and communal creed-there'd be little to oppose. But Cosby often pits the rhetoric of personal responsibility against the legitimate claims of American citizens for their rights. He chides activists for pushing to reform the criminal-justice system, despite solid evidence that the criminal-justice system needs reform. His historical amnesia-his assertion that many of the problems that pervade black America are of a recent vintage-is simply wrong, as is his contention that today's young African Americans are somehow weaker, that they've dropped the ball. And for all its positive energy, his language of uplift has its limitations. After the Million Man March, black men embraced a sense of hope and promise. We were supposed to return to our communities and families inspired by a new feeling of responsibility. Yet here we are again, almost 15 years later, with seemingly little tangible change. I'd take my son to see Bill Cosby, to hear his message, to revel in its promise and optimism. But afterward, he and I would have a very long talk.\n\nOn the day last summer when Cosby met me for lunch in the West Village, it was raining, as it had been all week, and New York was experiencing a record-cold August. Cosby had just come from Max Roach's funeral and was dressed in a natty three-piece suit. Despite the weather, the occasion, and the oddly empty dining room, Cosby was energized. He had spent the previous day in Philadelphia, where he spoke to a group in a housing project, met with state health officials, and participated in a community march against crime. Grassroots black activists in his hometown were embracing his call. He planned, over the coming year, to continue his call-outs and release a hip-hop album. (He has also noted, however, that there won't be any profanity on it.)\n\nCosby was feeling warm and nostalgic. He asked why I had not brought my son, and I instantly regretted dropping him off at my partner's workplace for a couple of hours. He talked about breaking his shoulder playing school football, after his grandfather had tried to get him to quit. \"Granddad Cosby got on the trolley and came over to the apartment,\" he recalled. \"I was so embarrassed. I was laid out on the sofa. He was talking to my parents, and I was waiting for the moment when he would say, 'See, I told you, Junior.' He came back and reached in his pocket and gave me a quarter. He said, 'Go to the corner and get some ice cream. It has calcium in it.'\"\n\nMuch pop psychology has been devoted to Cosby's transformation into such a high-octane, high-profile activist. His nemesis Dyson says that Cosby, in his later years, is following in the dishonorable tradition of upper-class African Americans who denounce their less fortunate brethren. Others have suggested more-sinister motivations-that Cosby is covering for his own alleged transgressions. (In 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit filed by a woman who claimed that he had sexually assaulted her; other women have come forward with similar allegations that have not gone to court.) But the depth of his commitment would seem to belie such suspicions, and in any case, they do not seem to have affected his hold on his audience: in the November Pew survey, 85 percent of all African American respondents considered him a \"good influence\" on the black community, above Obama (76 percent) and second only to Oprah Winfrey (87 percent).\n\nPart of what drives Cosby's activism, and reinforces his message, is the rage that lives in all African Americans, a collective feeling of disgrace that borders on self-hatred. As the comedian Chris Rock put it in one of his infamous routines, \"Everything white people don't like about black people, black people really don't like about black people ... It's like a civil war going on with black people, and it's two sides-there's black people and there's niggas, and niggas have got to go ... Boy, I wish they'd let me join the Ku Klux Klan. Shit, I'd do a drive-by from here to Brooklyn.\" (Rock stopped performing the routine when he noticed that his white fans were laughing a little too hard.) Liberalism, with its pat logic and focus on structural inequities, offers no balm for this sort of raw pain. Like the people he preaches to, Cosby has grown tired of hanging his head.\n\nThis disquiet spans generations, but it is most acute among those of the civil-rights era. \"I don't know a better term than angst ,\" says Johnnetta Cole. \"I refuse to categorize every young African American with the same language, but there are some 'young'uns'-and some of us who are not 'young'uns'-who must turn around and look at where we are, because where we're headed isn't pretty.\" Like many of the stars of the civil-rights movement, Cole has gifts that go beyond social activism. She rose out of the segregated South and went to college at age 15, eventually earning a bachelor's from Oberlin and a doctorate in anthropology from Northwestern. That same sort of dynamism exists today among many younger blacks, but what troubles the older generation is that their energy seems directed at other pursuits besides social uplift.\n\nCosby is fond of saying that sacrifices of the '60s weren't made so that rappers and young people could repeatedly use the word nigger . But that's exactly why they were made. After all, chief among all individual rights awarded Americans is the right to be mediocre, crass, and juvenile-in other words, the right to be human. But Cosby is aiming for something superhuman-twice as good, as the elders used to say-and his homily to a hazy black past seems like an effort to redeem something more than the present.\n\nWhen people hear Bill Cosby's message, many assume that he is the product of the sort of family he's promoting-two caring parents, a stable home life, a working father. In fact, like many of the men he admonishes, Cosby was born into a troubled home. He was raised by his mother because his father, who joined the Navy, abandoned the family when Cosby was a child. Speaking to me of his youth, Cosby said, \"People told me I was bright, but nobody stayed on me. My mother was too busy trying to feed and clothe us.\" He was smart enough to be admitted to Central High School, a magnet school in Philadelphia, but transferred and then dropped out in 10th grade and followed his father into the service.\n\nBut the twists and turns of that reality seem secondary to the tidier, more appealing world that Cosby is trying to create. Toward the end of our lunch, in a long, rambling monologue, Cosby told me, \"If you looked at me and said, 'Why is he doing this? Why right now?,' you could probably say, 'He's having a resurgence of his childhood.' What do I need if I am a child today? I need people to guide me. I need the possibility of change. I need people to stop saying I can't pull myself up by my own bootstraps. They say that's a myth. But these other people have their mythical stories-why can't we have our own?\""

      "text": "Mohsin Hamid's Empty Parable\n\nThe author's novel about race transformation fails to take an old idea to new places.\n\nA man wakes to find himself transformed. He looks around, seeking his bearings as he tries to come to terms with what has happened to him overnight, perhaps after uneasy dreams. He looks at his hand, which he knows like ... well, like the back of his hand. It is unfamiliar, the hand of another. He seeks out his reflection. The man who looks back at him is a stranger.\n\nThese are the opening beats of Mohsin Hamid's latest novel, The Last White Man : \"One morning Anders, a white man, woke up to find he had turned a deep and undeniable brown.\" These are also the opening beats-albeit about a black man who wakes up white-of A. Igoni Barrett's Blackass (2015), the epigraph of which cites Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" to make the debt explicit. It's also the premise of a chapter of Matt Ruff's Lovecraft Country (2016) about a black woman who wakes up white, which, per its title, \"Jekyll in Hyde Park,\" alludes to Robert Louis Stevenson's scene from 1886: \"The hand of Henry Jekyll ... large, firm, white, and comely\" appears \"in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bed-clothes ... lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair.\" Perhaps Hamid is hoping to make good on a saying from his first novel, Moth Smoke (2000): \"Tales with unoriginal beginnings are those most likely later to surprise.\"\n\nLike the hero of Herman Raucher's novelization of Watermelon Man (1970), Anders's first impulse is to mistake himself for a dark-skinned home intruder. Like the hero of Harry Stephen Keeler's The Man Who Changed His Skin (1959), Anders soon realizes this isn't just a tan, either: \"He looked like another person, not just another person, but a different kind of person, utterly different.\" Like the hero of Mortimer Weisinger's pulp story, \"Pigments Is Pigments\" (1935), Anders reacts with shock at his darkening, then falls into a \"murderous rage.\" As with the more scientifically minded versions of this plot, like Jess Row's Your Face in Mine (2014) and Maurice Carlos Ruffin's We Cast a Shadow (2019), we'll soon find out whether the transformation is explicable or reversible. We'll discover whether it afflicts just Anders or spreads to others like a fad, as in George S. Schuyler's Black No More (1931), or like a plague, as in Junot Díaz's story \" Monstro \" (2012).\n\nEven if you're unfamiliar with this tradition of stories about race transformation, you'll suspect what's coming. Distinguishing between those born dark and the newly transformed will become fraught. Violence will erupt. Some will come to believe that a genocidal conspiracy is to blame; some will kill themselves; some will kill others. \"Militants\" will take over, emitting fear and hate like a musk. Love will blossom. Heightened scenes of interracial sex and awkward perusals of genitals will follow. In the end, skin color will be shown to be meaningless for identity, a mere construct. Yet it will prove almost atavistically fascinating as an aesthetic surface and a conductor of feeling.\n\nTone above all distinguishes Hamid from these precursors. Whereas most of these writers bend race transformation toward satire, offering us topsy-turvy and hysterical tales, Hamid is deeply earnest about his conceit. The novel is that wan 21st-century banality, a \"meditation,\" and it meditates on how losing whiteness is going to make white people feel. Mostly sad, as it turns out.\n\nAnders is haunted by his entrance into double consciousness, which W. E. B. Du Bois famously first described in The Atlantic as being divided between your sense of yourself and your sense of how others perceive you . Anders obsesses over how white people will treat him now that they have no way \"to know he was white,\" and seems to sense their \"contempt and fascination.\" As for his new kind, \"all these dark people around, more dark people than white people ... made Anders uneasy, even though he was dark too.\" He feels he's been recast as a supporting character in his life; he feels \"triply imprisoned, in his skin, in this house, in this town.\" He dons a hoodie and sunglasses to hide himself from strangers and family.\n\nFrom the August 1897 issue: W. E. B. Du Bois's \"Strivings of the Negro People\"\n\nAnders feels comfortable enough to reveal his new body only to his sometime lover, a high-school friend named Oona. They smoke some weed and give it a spin:\n\nThe sex improves; the prose does not. A phrase from a later scene, \"arousal shadowed by gloom,\" captures the general feeling. The novel evinces the worst of Hamid's style, intensifying his turn in Exit West (2017) toward folksy transitions (\"and so it was\"), diction that manages to be both officious and purple (\"the performance was strong for them, visceral\"), and run-ons that feel less breathless than halting, laden as they are with comma-capped redundancies (\"maybe both doing both, in a way\") and reversals (\"unexpectedly, or not so unexpectedly\"). As in his earlier novels about social mobility and immigration, romance supplies the plot and casts an aura of \"love\" over the politico-speculative gimmick. But Hamid here emphasizes the familial, perhaps as a stand-in for the genetic: The love between generations meets the idea that race is an inherited trait.\n\nThe titular last white man is in fact Anders's widowed father, who responds to his son's new condition by weeping \"like a shudder, like an endless cough, without a sound,\" then giving him a gun. Anders feels guilty for his darkness; \"just by being here, Anders was taking something from his father, taking his dignity.\" But his father makes it his dying task to accept Anders, even though\n\nFamily blood and racial blood are pitted against each other.\n\nOona's mother, who vomits when she catches the interracial couple in flagrante, is also averse to the barbarian transformation, which she predicts: \"People are changing,\" she warns her daughter early on. \"All over. Our people.\" Hooked up to an IV of online fearmongering and cable news, she has become a \"fantasist\"; her belief \"that life was fair and would turn out for the best and good people like them got what they deserved\" has warped upon the death of her husband into an embittered crouch, a \"deep, abiding panic\" that springs into a \"brittle\" joy once the violence begins. Oona, \"a realist\" unnerved by this nativist zealotry, is inspired by Anders's transformation to paint herself with brown makeup. But this flirtation with blackface leaves Oona \"ashamed,\" and though she appreciates her new features when she too turns dark, \"a feeling of melancholy\" yet touches her, \"a sadness at the losing of something.\"\n\nThings settle down. Darkness-in the novel's conception, more a symbolic hue than an ethnicity-sweeps inexorably, beneficently over town. A child's notion: If everyone is \"the same, just dark,\" what is there to fight about? Anders's father dies; the last white man is buried; you might think the newly darkened (the darkies?) will get together for a block party. Instead, they take walks to process their feelings. Oona and Anders fall in love, move in together, have a daughter-she comes out \"brown\" and \"ferocious.\" By then, Oona's mother has lost her whiteness, too. When she waxes nostalgic about the glories of the white past, her brown granddaughter stills her with a word, \"stop,\" and a kiss. This is the novel's cure for white despair over the loss of whiteness: Keep calm and carry on.\n\nNever one to let us get away with missing an analogy, Hamid tells us of our baleful lovers:\n\nWhat exactly is being mourned? Whiteness in The Last White Man is a dream. It's the neighborhood watch and home security. It's weight lifting in an old-school gym, men testing themselves against gravity. It's yoga in a scentless studio, women \"staving off aging through attempts to remain supple.\" It's going out drinking, going out dancing, going out to dinner. It's the myth that \"a gun was a marker on the journey of death, and was to be respected as such, like a coffin or a grave or a meal in winter.\" It's having no vocation and curating yourself online. It's feeling \"cashed out, emotion-wise\" but flush enough in cash for provisions to survive a race riot. Primarily, it's not being \"dark.\" (The word black is verboten in The Last White Man , appearing only once, to describe iron.)\n\nWhat exactly is being born-or rather, borne? Darkness in The Last White Man is an ordeal. Those who were already dark have little presence and no internal life in the novel. There is no sense that they have cultures or mores; Anders still sees them, \"he could not help it, ... like a group of animals.\" Darkened Oona comes to notice \"finer gradations in the texture of someone's skin and the shape of their cheekbones and the nature of their hair,\" but this somehow leads to a conceit comparing people to trees. Darkness awakens \"the ancient horrors ... the almost forgotten savagery upon which [the] town was founded.\" Anders wonders if \"maybe that was the point, the point of it was to break him, to break all of them, all of us, yes us, how strange to be forced into such an us.\"\n\nDespite its conciliatory tone, this echoes the narratives that Oona's mother reads online about\n\nThe Last White Man in this way dramatizes the inane, paranoiac interpretation of migration known as the \"Great Replacement,\" which was just condemned in a 2022 resolution by the U.S. House of Representatives .\n\nThis conspiracy theory claims that the West is being colonized in reverse by the global South, and has inspired a string of white-supremacist terrorist attacks in places such as Christchurch, New Zealand, and, most recently, Buffalo , New York. The trope of \"colored hordes\" overwhelming white nationhood is an old and eugenicist idea. The French author Renaud Camus gave it new life when he named it the \"Great Replacement\" in a short book he published on the subject in 2011. That same year, Anders Behring Breivik set off a bomb that killed eight people , then went on to hunt down and murder 69 members of the Norwegian Workers' Youth League, mostly teenagers. What are we meant to make of Hamid's giving his latest hero the name of the man who applied the logic of \"the last white man\" so horrifically?\n\nIf Hamid's novel were a self-aware satire of this ideology of whiteness and its violent effects, it would be pitch-perfect. But The Last White Man 's structure affords us no way to know if this is what Hamid intends: It includes no higher judgment, no specific history, no novelistic frame against which to measure the reliability of the narration, no backdrop across which irony can dance.\n\nThe characters are mostly presented as your basic good white people, trying their best to deal with the coming darkness: \"Oona wondered ... if her mother was always going to find a way to carry on, and had simply been mourning, or not simply, there was nothing simple about it, but mainly, mainly been mourning, as a woman who had lost her husband and her son was entitled to do.\" Hamid lets them grieve for what is posited as a genuine loss of whiteness, with no compulsive melancholy, no unhealthy attachments, no obsessive shrines left over. Just mementos and a brown child who symbolizes a race-blind future. The Last White Man feels like a primer for mourning whiteness, not a critique of it.\n\nTo accede to the idea that whiteness can be lost, albeit in the name of open-endedness and open-mindedness, is to exculpate the capitalist imperialism that invented race in the first place. Whiteness isn't monolithic any more than darkness is-remember the Irish, the Jews? Nor is it a dream for everyone. Remember James Joyce's line? \"History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\" Hamid's commitment to a liberal literary ethos veers close to a vague both-sides-ism:\n\nIt's one thing for a character to be afflicted with blurred vision or the race \"blindness\" that grants Oona a \"new kind of sight\"; it's another for the novel to suffer the same confusion of perspective.\n\nThere are two cracks in the humanist glaze, patches of clarity in the blur. A dark man follows Oona and Anders on a walk, scares them with a shout, then walks off, laughing at their hysterical reaction. And a dark-from-the-start, nameless \"cleaning guy\" at the gym where Anders works declines Anders's belated offer to train him. \"What I would like,\" the man adds, \"is a raise.\" Both of these fleeting scenes are genuinely funny. Why don't we follow these dark men home? Or any of the other people born dark, who must surely be annoyed as well as amused by these confused, deracinated, sad-sack interlopers? Wouldn't their lives offer an interesting foil or counterpoint?\n\nAn earlier novel by the same author might have pursued this tack. Hamid's characters sometimes offer scathing indictments of racial capitalism, like this one from a rapscallion in Moth Smoke :\n\nHamid's narrators often refer matter-of-factly, sometimes with delight, to the variety of darker complexions, to the difference between being a brown Muslim and a black Muslim, to the internal diversity within Pakistani or Nigerian culture. It is taken for granted that \"darkness\" is not just half of a simplistic racial binary, but rather a pluriform, diasporic, and syncretic cultural phenomenon.\n\nHamid seems to have sacrificed this sort of specificity in favor of a polished brand of globalish allegory. If in this latest work his characters grow black, over his career, they seem to have grown ever more blank. The primary political dialectic of Moth Smoke is rich Lahore and poor Lahore; in The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007), it's New York City and Lahore. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2013) never names the Asian country where it's set; the protagonists of Exit West leave an unnamed, presumably Muslim, country in the putative East and move steadily West. And in the unnamed, probably European country of The Last White Man , we have shifted to an even larger-scale paradigm: the dark and the white. This drift toward the general is also a drift toward the didactic, one that is only nominally secular insofar as it amounts to a righteous liberalism that promises us a peek, as Oona says, into \"a mystical truth, a terrible mystical truth\" about humanity. Hamid's work is starting to look a lot like high-flown self-help, Paulo Coelho or Robin DiAngelo for the jet-setting smart set.\n\nHamid has always tended to map the rising tensions of romance onto the movements of social mobility onto metafictional asides about the relations between authors and readers-as if love, politics, and literature were all simply different ways to negotiate intimacy. The absurdity of these equivalences becomes clear in the closing lines of How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia :\n\nBeyond the creepiness, this pablum presumes reversibility. Yes, the political affects the personal, and both affect the literary. But having sex with the right person won't change the world; reading the right book won't either. Dark-washing characters won't disappear race, nor will believing that brown kids are our future.\n\nYet this kind of magical thinking will no doubt continue to meet with success in an era obsessed with the conviction that we are all in a moment of racial reckoning. What Hamid's novels actually offer isn't education but recognition, a self-congratulatory reconfirmation of ideas like \"migration is a death\" and \"race is a construct,\" which are true enough but also truisms by now. Despite the horrors it has conjured, \"the end of whiteness\" is just another mantra of our current discourse; whether you are troubled by it or merely curious, Hamid is here to talk you through it.\n\nBut who is you ? Whom is this novel for? Hamid has never shied from connecting his characters' identity crises to his own. \"I was not certain where I belonged,\" the narrator of The Reluctant Fundamentalist says, \"in New York, in Lahore, in both, in neither.\" In a recent New Yorker interview , Hamid explains the origin and intent of The Last White Man :\n\nThis way of putting it hums with the soothing privilege of the elite. Apparently, the solutions to the problem-to the violence-of the color line were with us all along: Fiction! Imagination! Empathy!\n\nThe Last White Man offers no news for the nonwhite among us. Maybe Hamid wants it that way. This is unfortunate, because now is a good time to remind ourselves that \"dark\" people, despite our erasure from national narratives, have been in the West for centuries. We have our own perspectives; we have said and written and done many things-and not just about whiteness, or race, or racism. We are not, and have never been, mere symbols or surfaces for melancholy reflection. You might even say that we have tended on the whole to add some color to things, with our highly particular food, fashion, words, music, art-with that stuff of life that usually goes by the name of culture.\n\nThis article appears in the September 2022 print edition with the headline \"A World Without White People\"\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Message to the White Man: We're not thinking about you\n\nIf there is one thing I'd like my white readers to get out of this blog, it is some sense of the great diversity of opinion and sensibility which exist within black America. One of the most poisonous ideas to emerge out of the cultural wars of the 80s and 90s was this portrait of black America as a hotbed of radical leftists who spend their days berating Jews, demanding reparations, and thinking of new and exciting ways to make white folks feel guilty. I think that image has come to dominate because so many public intellectuals working in the arena of race began to confuse the debates occurring in the sociology departments of elite campuses and in the salons of the Upper West Side, with the debates that rank and file black folks have amongst themselves. No disrespect, but New York City and the Ivy Leagues may be the most distortive influences on the picture of black life, short of BET.\n\nI say that as an avowed liberal and lefty, who has his roots in the black nationalist communities. Obviously I'd love it if large swaths of black America were obsessed with social and racial justice, but take it from someone who spent many a day trying to make that a reality, it just isn't the case. This is important because a key measure of humanity is the right to be wrong, the right to be complicated, to be contradictory. Just as America can at once be the first enlightenment republic and still carry with it a long legacy of white supremacy, black people can be the greatest engine for social change in this country history, and still believe that gay marriage should be banned. I obviously have huge problems with the latter half of that equation, but once you see that, within a group, political views can diverge all kinds of ways, it becomes foolish to define a group strictly by those views.\n\nThis leads me to the latest backward attempt to analyze Barack Obama and race. I think the MSM, frankly, needs to just give up on this whole topic, their record is disastrous. First Obama wasn't black enough. Then he was so black that he couldn't win the nomination. Now the question is \"How black is too black?\" Lemme explain something to you, dog: I just watched a black man carry Iowa and Oregon and then carry roughly nine out of ten black voters. Don't give me that business about Appalachia. You know damn well if I had told you three years ago that a black man would do that you would have laughed at me. With that backdrop I've gotta say, I don't even know what the phrase \"too black\" means.\n\nOne thing I do know, the Times definition of blackness--\"a sense of black grievance\"--is a joke. And if it weren't Al Sharpton would have dominated the black vote. That sort of flat rendering of black America, keep up this false idea that the most unifying factor of black culture is the ability to make white people feel guilty. Look, I know this is tough to believe, but black people aren't nearly as obsessed with white people, as media would have you think. Fueling that notion is  a cheap and easy way to fill some column inches, while not giving a flying fuck about stripping the humanity and complexity away from black folks. I should have known it was over when I saw the headline, but the dead giveway that I was in the midst of a half-hearted effort was here:\n\nMr. Obama's campaign so de-emphasized race that for most of the 17-month nomination contest much of the news media became obsessed with the question of whether he was \"black enough\" to win black votes.\n\nWhat a crock. Obama emphasized race about as much as most black people on the street emphasize race. What these intellectuals can't see is that the same issues that keep white folks up at night--the war, the economy, health care--are the same damn issues that keep black folks up at night. And I love the tautological bit about the news media obsessing over whether Obama is black enough. DUDE, YOU ARE THE NEWS MEDIA. You obsess over it because you're too lazy to ask the hard questions about Obama and race.\n\nI love that the talking heads now think that they are the arbiters of what is and ain't black. These folks wouldn't be able to do the Electric Slide if you gave them a take-home DVD, can't pick Kenya Moore out of a lineup, ain't never set foot on the campus of an HBCU (don't even know what it stands for), and these cats are gonna tell us what's \"too black\" and what ain't. Come on man. Humor me a little, at least. Listen to some Isaac Hayes records. Then let's talk.\n\nUPDATE : Commenter Herb offers a solid critique:\n\nWhile you skate pretty close to \"white people just don't get it\" territory, you make some good points. As a white guy who doesn't line dance (not even the Achy Break Heart), never heard of Kenya Moore (thanks for educating me on that one), and lives in a state with no HBCUs, I can say that I am an absolute outsider to the black experience.\n\nI'm still not willing to wall off aspects of culture based on race. I find the \"whites only\" mentality from years past as offensive as the \"blacks only\" mentality you sometimes see today. (Exhibit #1 of what I mean by the \"blacks only\" mentality: The N word. Hey, us white people want to sing along to our rap records too!)\n\nI think the best way to get past racism is to acknowledge that race is largely meaningless. There's no white culture or black culture. There's just culture.\n\nYup, I don't believe in the \"white people just don't get it\" line of thinking. Half of what I know about black people I learned from white people. I'm talking about Peter Guralnick , Nicholas Lehmann , Kate Boo and Dan Baum . These are cats who treated black folks like actual human beings, who did not sit in apartments or in television studios pontificating and acting like they'd spent time learning the mores of black people, when, at best, all they'd done is read John Ridley's latest in Esquire. This ain't racial at all. I find Juan Williams about as ignorant about the current state of black folks as Pat Buchanan. I also think the author of this \"What is too black\" piece was black himself.\n\nAs for the point about culture, I don't believe in \"racial\" culture either. But much as Jews exist as a religious group and an ethnic group, blacks exist as a racial group (ugh, as much as race exists) but more importantly as an ethnic group. There is no universal white culture--but there is an Italian-American culture, a Jewish American culture, an Upper West Side culture, a white Southern culture, an Appalachian Scots-Irish culture etc. And all of those are tributaries feeding into the broader American culture. Black folks are the same way. The culture isn't race-based--anybody who spends some time studying, and is equipped with some measure of empathy, can get it. But my problem is people who don't want to put in that time, but then want to go out and make blanket statements about \"What Black Is,\" if I may paraphrase Brother Jay.\n\nIt's like, am I not black because I don't sit around thinking about \"black grievance\"? If blackness is based on \"black grievance,\" how did Barack grab 90 percent of the black vote when he spent most of his time talking about the collective needs of the country? Why is Bill Cosby one of the most popular figures, among black people, in this country? Why did Barack deploy Oprah to South Carolina? Are these people, now, not black?\n\nThere is great hypocrisy here: The same mofos who jump on the necks of urban youth for playing the \"not black enough\" game, will gladly turn the tables and pull the same shit on Barack Obama. If it's pathological for a sixth grader to tease another kid for being \"too white,\" then its equally pathological to bloviate in the Times about whether Barack Obama is \"too black.\""

      "text": "3 Tropes of White Victimhood\n\nLeading conservative pundits today are pounding themes that were popular among opponents of Reconstruction.\n\nI n the conservative world, the idea that white people in the United States are under siege has become doctrine. In recent weeks, three prominent figures have each offered their own versions of this tenet.\n\nIn June, Brian Kilmeade, one of the hosts of Fox & Friends , claimed that activists were \"trying to take down white culture.\"\n\nAlso in June, Tucker Carlson, speaking on his nightly show with an Anti-White Mania graphic in the background , implied that racial strife was imminent and asked: \"How do we save this country before we become Rwanda?\"\n\nThe same month, Pat Robertson, a former Republican presidential candidate and the host of the Christian Broadcasting Network's flagship show, The 700 Club , said that militants are telling \"people of color ... to rise up and overtake their oppressors.\" He worried that, \"having gotten the whip handle-if I can use the term,\" people of color were now in a position \"to instruct their white neighbors how to behave.\" Robertson warned that if this trend continues, \"America is over. It is just that simple.\"\n\nKilmeade, Carlson, and Robertson all blamed critical race theory, a school of legal thought developed in the 1980s that has become the latest fixation of the conservative outrage machine. But the panic they expressed has a much longer history, with roots going back to white-supremacist rhetoric from before the Civil War-and particularly apparent during the attack on Reconstruction, America's experiment in interracial democracy that lasted from 1865 until 1877.\n\nIndeed, each of the three pundits expressed a key strand of the rhetoric of racial reaction that was pervasive among critics of Reconstruction: Carlson deployed inversion , by which white people declare reverse racism or anti-whiteness to be the crucial problem of prejudice and white people to be uniquely oppressed as a result of excessive power granted to Black Americans; Robertson deployed projection , in which white people assert that they will be treated the way they treated Black people during the Jim Crow era; and Kilmeade deployed victimization , as when a white southerner in 1875 described his region as \" stripped of her honors, her glory, her pride ... trampled into dust \" by recently enacted laws.\n\nThese tropes of inversion, projection, and victimization overlap. During the Reconstruction era, and long afterward, white reactionaries in both the South and the North projected that the movement for racial equality was animated by what the Confederate-nostalgic newspaper The Watchman and Southron called a \"hatred of the white people of the South and a determination to humiliate them as much as possible.\" Using the language of inversion and victimization in 1875, the Louisville Courier-Journal -which was associated with the anti-Reconstruction Democratic Party-described Reconstruction as a \"scheme of upturning society and placing the bottom on top: an effort to legislate the African into an Anglo-Saxon.\"\n\nHere it is worth pausing to state the obvious: Nothing akin to what the Mississippi politician John D. Freeman called in 1868 \"negro superiority and supremacy\" ever happened-or was ever even close to happening. Although many white people like Freeman maintained that Reconstruction would inevitably culminate with their being \"enslaved and crushed out of civil and political existence,\" the goal of Reconstruction was not oppression. It was racial equality.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Tucker Carlson, unmasked\n\nEven during the most radical phase of Reconstruction-when the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments passed; the southern states rewrote their constitutions; Black Americans held a wide variety of national, state, and local political offices ; and the federal government briefly committed to enforcing civil rights-that equality remained largely aspirational, as white southerners retained their tight grip on political and economic power. As the staunchly Republican Chicago Tribune observed in 1868: \" How four millions of blacks can establish supremacy over eight millions of whites, both having the same political rights, has not been shown by any mathematician .\" Rather than the future of \"negro domination\" many white southerners claimed to fear, the white supremacy they yearned for-and all its attendant violence-returned full throttle a little more than a decade after the end of Reconstruction. It was no longer underpinned by chattel slavery but by new relations of peonage, exploitation, legalized segregation, and disenfranchisement.\n\nThis reality did nothing to halt the emerging narrative of white victimization. \"When the future historian comes to write up the history of the American union,\" according to a Kansas City newspaper associated with the Democratic Party in 1867, only two short years after the abolition of slavery, \"he can truthfully inscribe upon his last page this epitaph: 'Here lies a nation, that in giving freedom and independence to the negro, lost its own.'\" The enemies of Reconstruction described inclusive democracy as not just psychologically unsettling but illegitimate, what a letter writer to The Courier-Journal called in early 1868 an \"inversion of ... just and lawful relations.\" The writer demanded a future in which \"the white race would spring back to its position of natural supremacy, while the black race would fall back to its position of natural subordinacy.\"\n\nIn 1867, the Charleston Mercury , which had been the South's leading secessionist newspaper, translated white allegations of racial subordination into a diagnosis of political unfreedom: \"the despotism of the barbarous negro over the white man.\" The areas where critics of centralized state power identified overreach almost always involved efforts to promote racial equality. Anticipating an image that we tend to associate with Friedrich A. Hayek's 1944 critique of the incipient welfare state, The Road to Serfdom , the former Union General Abram S. Piatt of Ohio said in 1867 that the \"the Radical party has advanced on the road to despotism.\" He singled out the Freedmen's Bureau, which had been set up by Congress in 1865 to assist the roughly 4 million recently emancipated Americans, and the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, two of the federal government's most significant efforts to legislate on behalf of Black freedom before the Civil and Voting Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965.\n\nOpponents of Reconstruction regularly employed the freedom/slavery binary to describe their claimed loss of liberty. \"There is no negro slavery now in the Southern States,\" declared the white supremacist Daily Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1868, \"but a vast deal of white slavery.\" This was a remarkable assertion of inversion, coming as it did only three years after the end of America's nearly 250-year history of chattel slavery.\n\nOne term used to describe the process of the \" inversion of ... established order\" -which the Charleston Mercury characterized in 1867 as \"white slavery under negro rule \" -was featured in Tucker Carlson's graphic: anti-white . Historically, those who deployed inversion almost always paired anti-white with pro-negro . In 1867, for example, The Chicago Times -a strongly Democratic paper founded with the backing of Abraham Lincoln's foe, Stephen A. Douglas-complained that a civic group planning to invite as speakers some former abolitionists, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Wendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass, and Anna Dickinson, was showing itself to be \"pro-negro, anti-white man.\" Variations of the \"pro-negro, anti-white\" pairing appeared frequently, sometimes using the N-word. In 1870, the strongly anti-Reconstruction Memphis Appeal described the Fifteenth Amendment, which guaranteed suffrage to all adult, male American citizens, as the \"crowning victory\" of Radical Republican \"anti-white negroism.\"\n\nPat Robertson's language of Black Americans holding the \"whip handle\" previously gripped by the slaveholding class was also a popular metaphor a century and a half ago, when it was employed to advance the view that Black Americans had usurped coercive power rightly belonging to white people. In describing the soon-to-be eclipsed political dynamic of Reconstruction, in which white politicians had to attend to the concerns of all Americans rather than just their fellow white men, one commentator wrote in the Georgia Weekly Telegraph in 1874 that \"the negroes feel they have the whip-hand.\"\n\nRead: Tucker Carlson's manufactured America\n\nThis was one of many invocations of the material implements of enslavement and anti-Black violence that white opponents appropriated during the Reconstruction era and beyond. They also described themselves as manacled or having chains riveted upon them by Reconstruction's indignities. Barely two years after the close of the Civil War, Mississippi Governor Benjamin G. Humphreys announced that, if the Radical Republicans were to succeed, he and his fellow white citizens would \"have to take back seats or be elevated at the end of a rope\" -two instances of projection in one breath.\n\nNot all projection involved the threat of racialized murder or violence. Much of it focused on being forcefully rendered powerless. White opponents of Reconstruction routinely claimed that \" social equality \" was being \"crammed down our throats, with the aid of the brute force of the negro\" ; or that white people's rights were being \" trampled into the earth, in order that an aristocracy of four million negroes shall be established upon their graves \"; or that Black \"iron heels\" were stepping on white necks to \"crush out their last hope of liberty.\" All of these images reversed the reality of power in the postbellum South.\n\nThe self-pity and victimization expressed by Brian Kilmeade also reflects the ambient mood of Reconstruction's enemies. The former Confederate and future United States Senator Ben H. Hill of Georgia declared in 1868 that the Reconstruction government aimed to \" disfranchise and degrade whites for no reason but that of a vindictive hatred .\" Similarly, an observer at Virginia's Constitutional Convention of 1868 claimed to be sickened by being forced to listen to endless \"encomiums upon the negro race,\" alongside \"wholesale denunciations of the whites of the South.\"\n\nAnother way that opponents of Reconstruction projected the topsy-turvy world they claimed Radical Republican rule had created was to reverse the most infamous passage in the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford case. In what scholars have since described as the worst decision in American judicial history, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that Black Americans had \"no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\" Ten years later, in 1867, a Virginia newspaper decrying \"negro rule\" claimed that Reconstruction was based on \" the arrogant assumption that the true white men of the South have no rights which need to be respected .\" The following year, The New York Times , reporting on conventions that were rewriting constitutions across the South to make state laws equitable, noted that the \"colored delegates\" to those conventions \" evidently think the people ... have no 'rights' or sympathies which the Conventions are bound to respect. \" The \"people\" the newspaper referred to were understood to be white.  In 1870, Pennsylvania's Northumberland County Democrat , whose motto was \" We Support the White Man's Ticket,\" repeatedly employed the N-word to characterize those, including the state's Republican governor, John W. Geary, who, in the newspaper's view, would deny that white men had rights worth respecting.\n\nSetting a template for future backlashes , critics of Reconstruction voiced their opposition as besieged victims in registers of humiliation and disgust, and they married their victimization with promises of imminent violence. President Andrew Johnson modeled this language when he said that Reconstruction amounted to a form of \"military tyranny\" that would \"precipitate\" a violent response \"more damaging than the last civil war,\" a deadly threat given the destructiveness of that conflict.\n\nMany Democratic opponents of Radical Republicanism, echoing Johnson, claimed that white humiliation would inevitably set off a spate of extralegal violence, which they framed as fully justified. \"If ever a people had a right to rebel against tyrannical Government,\" said a Missouri newspaper editorial headlined \"The Cost of Negro Government,\" \"the people of this country possess this right.\" When the paper referred to the \"people of this country,\" it meant, of course, its white citizens. \"We are a law-abiding people,\" wrote Elbert Hartwell English, who had served as chief justice of Arkansas before Reconstruction and would do so again in 1874, when Redemption came to his state, \"but the meanest reptile will sting when trampled upon,\" implying that a violent response was not only justified but instinctive and inevitable as long as the \"trampling\"-in the form of the \"radical political schemes and theories\" promoting equality-continued.\n\nLawrence Glickman: How white backlash controls American progress\n\nLong after the defeat of Reconstruction, these tropes persisted. They reemerged in especially robust form in the 1940s and '50s, with the onset of the period that historians call the \" long civil-rights movement .\" In an echo of the earlier rhetoric of coercion, Sam Englehardt, a segregationist leader from Alabama, said in 1958 that the federal government was \" attempting to ram integration down our throats .\" Opponents of civil rights began to talk about the onset of what they called the \"Second Reconstruction\": the government stepping in again to promote Black Americans' civil rights after many decades of inaction. Reviving the language of victimization and self-pity, they made explicit and repeated references to the horrors of the first Reconstruction. \"In recent months and years,\" The Southern Watchman , a vehemently white-supremacist newspaper published in Greensboro, Alabama, by a man named Hamner Cobbs , said in 1943, \" the South has been subject to an organized campaign of vilification, the likes of which no section of America has witnessed since the original Reconstruction .\" Two years later, Cobbs requested that the government provide \"assurance to the white people\" concerned about losing their status. The specific assurance he asked for was a promise from the nation's \"political leadership\" that \" there will be no tampering with white rule ,\" meaning no effort \"to repeal or tamper with the poll tax,\" one of the means of preventing Black Americans from voting.\n\nAs the civil-rights movement accelerated, claims of \"anti-whiteness\" emerged again. All manner of supposed provocations-the 1961 documentary Walk in My Shoes , which focused on the lives of Black Americans; the Kennedy administration ; the Black Arts Theater of Harlem -were labeled \" anti-white and pro-Negro .\" In 1979, a letter writer to a Louisiana newspaper, identifying himself as a high officer (\"Giant, Province of Rapides\") of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, described Freedom Road , a historical drama on NBC, as an \" even bigger anti-white show \" than Roots . Anti-white continued to be a favorite term of white supremacists even in the post-civil-rights era.\n\nRobertson's metaphor of the whip handle has been used less often since the advent of the civil-rights era-which may be why he seemed to seek permission to use the phrase (\"if I can use the term\")-but analogies to slavery continue to be an important part of the vocabulary of what I have called \" elite victimization .\" During the coronavirus pandemic, for example, Attorney General William Barr and other critics of commonsense public-health measures compared mask wearing and state and local shutdowns to enslavement .\n\nThe path from the backlash to Reconstruction and the civil-rights movement to Kilmeade's, Carlson's, and Robertson's modern-day declarations did not follow a straight line, and claiming that the template for the 21st-century Republican Party was fully set during the 19th century would be reductionist. Yet the posture of resentment that once undergirded the reactionary response to Reconstruction continues to characterize an important tendency in the American right. According to a recent New York Times analysis, most people who participated in the Capitol insurrection of January 6 came from areas that are \"awash in fears that the rights of minorities and immigrants were crowding out the rights of white people in American politics and culture .\"\n\nSuch a perspective, however at odds with reality , is authorized by the tropes of victimization, inversion, and projection, which encourage white Americans to inhabit a fantasy world in which they are disempowered, degraded, humiliated, and vulnerable to abuse and violence, while people of color are given \"special advantages.\"\n\nA ll of these rhetorical gestures boil down to one issue about America that remains as relevant today as it was in the 1860s and '70s: Whose country is it? Who belongs here?\n\nMany white people have long rejected the idea of sharing political power. It was this conviction that led them to view Reconstruction as the \" great political crime of the century ,\" as J. P. Thomas, the superintendent of a military school in South Carolina, said in 1868. It also led them to proclaim the appointment of a Black man as the postmaster of Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1868 to be not a shining example of the possibilities of multiracial democracy, but hurtful and demeaning, an \" expression of contempt-a slap in the face of the State-an unprovoked and unfeeling insult. \"\n\nAnd it was this same conviction that led Tucker Carlson to claim, just this past April, \"I have less political power because they're importing a brand new electorate. Why should I sit back and take that?\" Carlson was echoing the zero-sum logic that white reactionaries have spouted for more than a century.\n\nOne of the most telling moments of Donald Trump's presidency, and our present political moment, came last December, after he was voted out of office but before the insurrection he fomented. \"We're all victims,\" he told a crowd in Georgia. \"Everybody here. All these thousands of people here tonight. They're all victims. Every one of you.\" Like the opponents of Reconstruction, Trump milked feelings of humiliation to authorize a politics of what President Johnson called \"restoration\"-the Reconstruction-era version of \"Make America great again.\"\n\nThe opponents of Reconstruction succeeded in their campaign against racial equality, setting the country on a path to great division and intolerable oppression. Those who traffic in these tropes continue to threaten to defer the promise of justice and democracy-yet again."

It comes only a month after the shooting massacre in Las Vegas, where another white man, Stephen Paddock, opened fire on concertgoers, killing 59 people, including himself. The majority of mass shootings are carried out by white men. For more on the connections between race, white supremacy and mass shootings, we speak to George Ciccariello-Maher, political science professor at Drexel University and the author of \"Decolonizing Dialectics.\" He was banned from campus after questioning why mass shootings in the United States are almost always carried out by white men.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But I wanted to bring George Ciccariello-Maher into this conversation, of Drexel University. You have been-you wrote immediately after the Las Vegas massacre, where the 64-year-old white man named Paddock had opened fire on concertgoers below, killing 59 of them. After you wrote, you were banned from the Drexel campus, after questioning why mass shootings in the United States are almost always carried out by white men? Is that right?\n\nGEORGE CICCARIELLO - MAHER : Yes. And to be clear, when I began to write about what had happened in Las Vegas, I was really writing about this broad question, right? And I think this is a question that we all need to grapple with: When you see these cases of sort of mass-this shocking mass brutality, what is it that makes white men so prone to this kind of behavior? And what might be going on today in our country, in which people are stoking a sort of victim complex among white men? You know, what might be happening today to encourage this kind of behavior and to radicalize these kind of actions?\n\nAnd I was immediately subject to a torrent of sort of abuse and threats from, you know, right-wing media outlets. And, you know, we're talking about Breitbart, The Daily Caller and these kind of websites. And it was on the basis of those, and the purported threats that they represented, that I was excluded from campus. My classes were initially canceled, despite the fact that in my classes we had had conversations about this, despite the fact that my students are very knowledgeable and intuitively grasp what is going on in the world around them, and were open to having conversations about these difficult things.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, your response to what happened on Sunday?\n\nGEORGE CICCARIELLO - MAHER : I mean, I think we're seeing these kinds of atrocities occurring, and we need to be really asking not only \"What can we do?\" I think these are important questions-what kind of immediate institutional reforms, whether it's targeted-you know, targeted gun control for domestic violence might be effective, but we also can't lose sight of these broader questions, and ask, \"What is going on in our society today? What is happening with regard to not only white people, but white men, in particular? What is going on with regard to race and gender as they function together?\"\n\nAnd in this case, in particular, again, we don't know all the facts. We don't know all the details. But we're talking about institutions, that also serve as breeding grounds for violent behavior. We're talking about not only sexual assault in the military, but domestic abuse of those surrounding it and those outside of it. And we're talking about other institutions, as well, that you could bring into the picture, institutions like policing, in which domestic violence is absolutely rife and in which it's very difficult to keep weapons out of the hands of those domestic abusers.\n\nAnd so, we need to think very deeply, I think, about the structural role of what's going in the society. Trump is abroad selling weapons. And we've got someone who, in this case, apparently, was trained, you know, trained to engage in violence abroad. And yet we act surprised when these people have breaks, when they fall into some kind of crisis, when they find maybe feelings of entitlement frustrated, that they then resort to violence, when we're talking about a structure and institutional apparatus that trains people in violence and that encourages them to feel as though they're on the losing side of history. You know, Trump makes hay out of the fact that white men, in particular, feel as though they're the victims of this society, despite being in absolute control of it. And this is something that is powerfully dangerous, and it's why we're not seeing only the rise in violent attacks, more generally, and the rise of far-right movements, but we're certainly seeing, you know, clearly, sort of some very serious incidents of mass violence, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, what's interesting, yesterday, for hour after hour, after this horror on television-you know, it came out that there was this mass killing in Texas, and they said the worst church massacre in U.S. history, and they said the worst Texas massacre-no one was saying anything about the killer, hour after hour. But clearly, people had seen him, right? Some had survived, people outside, the police. He was dead, whether it was self-inflicted or someone shot him. They clearly knew. And they were talking about, one, the tragedy and, two, not saying anything. And it only led us to believe it must be a white man who did this, because we would have known, I think, right away if the person was a person of color or, certainly, Muslim. We know that often before-when it's a case where someone is a Muslim or person of color, that's what they say immediately. Now it was just left hanging, and so you knew that this would be the case.\n\nGEORGE CICCARIELLO - MAHER : That's absolutely the case, I think. You know, whiteness is never seen as a cause, in and of itself, of these kinds of massacres, of other forms of violence, despite the fact that whiteness is a structure of privilege and it's a structure of power, and a structure that, when it feels threatened, you know, lashes out. And so, that's the kind of thing that we really need to think about, not only why is it-and I think there's a lot of attention to the fact that we demonize often Muslims or, you know, other people of color when these attacks occur. The far right, of course, jumps on any violence by people of color-and yet, you know, doesn't want to talk about the real deep structures of white supremacy in our society, and again, not just the fringe, not just the Nazi movements, but what people are going through every day and what it is that is driving people to these kinds of situations, where they feel so entitled to dominance that when that's questioned, they can explode in these very, very unpredictable ways-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then-\n\nGEORGE CICCARIELLO - MAHER : -and on targets that, you know, are not-you know, it's not a question of white supremacy playing a role simply because someone is targeting people of color. We're talking about people who are having, you know, mental-clear mental issues. But again, the cause needs to be identified outside and beyond that, and we need to think much, much harder about what's going on in our society that makes it so sick.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And very clearly, to clarify, so what is your status now at Drexel? And explain how other people have been treated in other situations. You cannot go on campus?\n\nGEORGE CICCARIELLO - MAHER : Yes, that's-that is the status at this point. I'm currently teaching classes online. My students are protesting and mobilizing to have me returned to campus, because there's no reason, certainly, to exclude faculty from campus for having important public conversations and for teaching about hard questions. That's what we're there to do.\n\nBut what you're seeing is a broad wave of aggression against faculty. You've seen dozens of cases, whether it's, you know, Tommy Curry at Texas A&M, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor at Princeton, Johnny Eric Williams at Trinity College. You're seeing far-right websites creating, stoking outrage, attacking faculty members who dare to speak about white supremacy and racism. That's really the common thread of all these cases, is these are anti-racist faculty members, usually people of color, who are targeted, who are attacked, who are threatened, and really having their lives threatened, over being willing to talk about what's going on in the country today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, George Ciccariello-Maher, we want to thank you for being with us, political science professor at Drexel.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Fifty-one-year-old Gregory Bush opened fire and killed Maurice Stallard and Vickie Lee Jones at a Kroger supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, shortly after trying to enter a predominantly black church. Bush reportedly then told an armed bystander that \"whites don't kill whites.\" As the community mourns, we speak with Kentucky Rep. Attica Scott and Reverend Vincent James, chief of community building for the city of Louisville and pastor of Elim Baptist Church.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: We begin today's show looking at the hate-fueled crimes that have swept the nation in the past week. Eleven worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh were killed Saturday in what has been described as the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. The attack came just one day after a Trump supporter in Florida named Cesar Sayoc was arrested and charged with mailing bombs to more than a dozen of the president's prominent critics, including the Clintons, the Obamas and George Soros. Law enforcement officers now say Sayoc had a list of over 100 targets.\n\nBut there was a third hate-fueled crime that received far less coverage last week: the murder of two elderly African-American customers at a Kentucky grocery store on Wednesday. Gregory Bush, a 51-year-old white man, opened fire and killed Maurice Stallard and Vickie Lee Jones at a Kroger supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, outside Louisville, after unsuccessfully trying to enter a predominantly black church. Now the community is demanding justice for what the Louisville [ sic ] chief of police has called a hate crime.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Gregory Bush was captured on a surveillance camera trying to force open the doors of the First Baptist Church of Jeffersontown for several minutes Wednesday, before turning his attention instead to the nearby supermarket, where he killed Maurice Stallard and Vickie Lee Jones. Armed bystander Ed Harrell confronted Bush in the parking lot outside the grocery store after the killings. This is Harrell's son Steve Zinninger speaking with a local NBC affiliate.\n\nREPORTER : So, your dad was confronting the shooter.\n\nSTEVE ZINNINGER : Yeah. Yeah.\n\nREPORTER : OK. Did that man say anything? Or, how did your dad figure out something wasn't right?\n\nSTEVE ZINNINGER : He didn't realize it was him 'til he'd already seen the gun by his side. And he said, \"Don't shoot me, I won't shoot you.\" He's like, \"Whites don't kill whites.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Whites don't kill whites,\" Gregory Bush said.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Gregory Bush has a history of making racist slurs and a long rap sheet of misdemeanor charges, including domestic violence, menacing and making terroristic threats. In 2009, a judge ordered Bush to surrender his guns and undergo mental health treatment, after his parents claimed he had threatened to shoot them. Bush's father has said his son, quote, \"carries a gun wherever he goes,\" unquote. It's not clear whether Bush's guns were returned when the court order expired in 2011.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Gregory Bush will face two counts of murder and 10 counts of wanton endangerment at a court hearing scheduled for November.\n\nFor more, we're going to Louisville to join two guests. Attica Scott is Kentucky state representative, certified anti-racism trainer. In 2016, she became the first African-American woman to serve in Kentucky's state Legislature in 20 years. And Reverend Vincent James is with us. He's chief of community building for the city of Louisville, pastor of Elim Baptist Church.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Reverend Vincent James, you knew one of the murder victims. Can you talk about what happened on Wednesday? Something that was not paid very much attention to around the country, first Bush's apparent attempt to get into a predominantly black church, then going over to Kroger's, the grocery store.\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Yes. Thank you, Amy, for having us on the show.\n\nWednesday was a very somber day. Somewhere a little before 3:00, all of us was in the office at the Mayor's Office, and one of our colleagues, we heard her scream. And she was on the phone, and she was talking with someone. We really didn't know what had happened at that point. And then, as time continued to proceed, we discovered that there was a possibility of a-there was a shooting, and there was the possibility that it was a family member.\n\nNot really understanding and knowing what had happened, we immediately went out to the location. We had several members of our team there. And we later discovered that Kellie Watson, who is the chief equity officer in metro-Louisville metro government, that it was her father, Maurice Stallard, who had been murdered, and another woman had been murdered in the parking lot.\n\nIt was a horrific day, a sad day. And we are continuing to grieve through this process. But one of the exciting things is that we're a very resilient city, and we've been working on some things, in terms of-out of Kellie's office, as the chief equity officer, in terms of looking at these very types of issues.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I wanted to ask Representative Attica Scott, in terms of the reaction of some public officials in the area about whether this was a hate crime or not, could you talk about that and the judgment that people did or didn't go through very soon after this crime occurred?\n\nREP . ATTICA SCOTT : Definitely. And when something like this happens, the entire community grieves and is anxious and is stressed out, and often looks to elected leaders to provide some direction and guidance. And in this situation, we, as an African-American community, were failed by many of our elected officials who refused to call this what it was, which is a hate crime. When you kill two black people-Ms. Jones and Mr. Stallard-and you try to break into a black church, that's a hate crime. And to have people at the local and state level refuse to even call it a hate crime sent a message to many of us in community that our lives do not indeed matter to some people. And we shouldn't have to beg you to call this what it is.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We hoped to have Mayor Greg Fischer on; he had to back out late last night. But, Reverend Vincent James, you work for the mayor. Can you talk about-\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Uh-huh, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about that, whether-\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -why the mayor didn't immediately call it a hate crime?\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Well, I can share with you, the mayor did come out and say that it was a hate crime. He talked about the fact that this situation was driven by hate. When you think about-and I have the privilege of pastoring a local African-American church in the city and understanding in terms of what the community needs and the hurt that a community goes through when they experience this. And just recently, yesterday, Mayor Greg Fischer and several local pastors and faith leaders in our community sat down and talked with the commonwealth attorney, Tom Wine, and talked about this very issue of a hate crime. It was a horrendous hate crime. And Mayor Fischer acknowledged it. He identified with it. And he grieves with the community and the families. And so, he is very aware and very in tune.\n\nAnd we've been working on these issues for the past several years, working with GARE , Government Alliance for Racial Equity, and putting together racial equity plans in terms of our community. One of our tenets in terms of when we think about our community is a very compassionate community. So, our mayor's heart was grieved. He's angered. But also, we're moving to action. We've put in action plans, and we're working with community leaders to begin to look at how this can never happen again in our community and how do we avoid these types of things. And so, as a community, we are very resilient, we are very focused, and we have a plan in place to be able to execute that this won't happen again.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Representative Scott, I wanted to see if you agree with the assessment of Reverend James and also if you could talk about this whole issue of the \"Blue Lives Matter\" legislation that went through the Legislature.\n\nREP . ATTICA SCOTT : We have to make sure that we have honest conversations about what got us here. And when we have a political system that passes hateful legislation, when we have societal issues around comments that are made, whether you're calling young black kids punks or thugs, or whether you're passing legislation like the \"Blue Lives Matter\" bill and changing Kentucky's hate crimes law to now include your profession, what you choose to do, if you're a first responder, including law enforcement, that sends a clear message across Kentucky about whose lives really do matter.\n\nAnd then, this year, passing a so-called gang bill, that we saw in Mississippi, in the eight years since it's been passed, that only black people have received an enhanced sentence from that gang bill-to have supported and then passed that bill here in Kentucky sends a message across our black communities and other communities of color that you are under attack by your own elected officials at the local and state level. And we have to have those honest conversations that say, \"Wait a minute. What are we doing to make sure that we're looking to restore people to their fullness rather than to incarcerate them so that we can justify building more prisons?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to correct: We had said the St. Louis [ sic ] police chief, but it's the Jeffersontown police chief, Sam Rogers.\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We had said the Louisville police chief, but the Jeffersontown police chief, Sam Rogers, who told the First Baptist Church on Sunday that the shooting was motivated by racism, was a hate crime. Can you talk, Reverend James, about the feelings right now inside the church that Bush apparently tried to get into? You're the reverend of another church.\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How churches are feeling right now? And also, this being the-one of a series of attacks this week. I mean, you have this man allegedly saying to a white man standing outside with a gun, outside Kroger's, \"Whites don't kill whites,\" like saying, \"Don't kill me,\" or he's not going to kill him.\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Then you have the letter bombs, now apparently 15 of them, sent out to people who are critics of President Trump, and then, of course, the horrific synagogue massacre that took place, that at another place of worship, in Pittsburgh, the funerals beginning today, with the anti-Semitic shooter who also linked Jewish groups helping immigrants and his fierce anti-immigrant hatred.\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : Yes, it's a very sad time in our country when we have these types of acts of hatred in our communities and in our churches and synagogues and mosques, when you think about all that has taken place across the country. But one of the things that-people of faith recognize the fact that these challenges are written in the holy word that these things were to come. And so, one of the things in terms of what we find and what we see as faith leaders, as community leaders, is that it is our faith that really drives us beyond what we see and what we experience, to hope; that we know that with people coming together and staying together, that we can change. We have to realize and know that this is not a time to turn on each other, but it's a time to turn to each other.\n\nAnd so, what I've seen across the faith community, talking with all kinds of faith leaders across our city and across this country, is the fact that we have a reality that we have to look at and confront, when we talk about hatred, when we talk about the rhetoric that is coming from our administration-a all these types of things that we, as a people of faith, have to rise above it and take action. You know, the reality is, is that it takes us as a people to recognize what is going on, and then we have to go to the polls. Next week is going to be a very critical time for our country, that we need to send a message that this type of behavior, this type of situation that happened in Pittsburgh, that happened in Louisville, is totally unacceptable, and we're going to change. And the way that you change that is going to the polls.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Reverend-\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : And so, the faith community is rising above. Uh-huh?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Reverend James, I wanted to ask you, in the same vein, for the-President Trump, after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh, said that perhaps armed guards were needed at places of worship. He said similar things after the Parkland shooting, that armed guards-or, the arming of teachers-he suggested the possibility of the arming of teachers. What's your response to this idea that maybe houses of worship should now have armed guards as a means of protecting themselves?\n\nREV . VINCENT JAMES : I don't believe that houses of faith or schools need to have armed guards. You know, that's not why we attend church. We attend church to be able to connect with our god and to be able to realize that our faith protects us. And even when challenges come against us, we know it because the word says no weapon will form against us. Doesn't mean that the weapon won't come, but it means in terms it won't prosper, that it won't destroy the hope and the resilience of the people, in spite of what challenges that we face.\n\nThat's why, in terms of having armed guards, you have to be secure and understand the Bible teaches us that we need to be wise as serpents and gentle as a dove. That means you have to be alert and awake in terms of things that could potentially happen, but you also have to have a heart of compassion and love and forgiveness.\n\nAnd so, when we recognize these types of things, we move forward with action and faith and hope, and knowing that these things, you know, have the possibility of existing, and we're prepared, in terms from a security standpoint, but not from the standpoint of having armed guards standing at the door. I think that is to the extreme of what we need in our country. We need to talk more about how do we live in peace as opposed to living in fear and in violence.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Attica Scott, as a political representative in Kentucky, not so far away are the races in Georgia and Florida right now, taking on extreme racial tones. You have the secretary of state of Georgia, Brian Kemp, withholding 53,000 registration forms, overwhelmingly African-American. He is the secretary of state, and he's running against Stacey Abrams. If she were to win, she'd become the first African-American woman governor in the country. And then Andrew Gillum, running for governor in Florida, the president just called him a \"stone cold thief.\" This followed a KKK -backed or some kind of white supremacist organization-backed robocall, and his opponent, DeSantis, telling voters to-not to \"monkey it up,\" right after he became the Democratic candidate. Your thoughts in this midterm election season, and then what happened this week, from Kentucky to Pittsburgh to the mail bombs that were sent out?\n\nREP . ATTICA SCOTT : My thoughts are that we better not, in Kentucky, act like we're immune from what we're seeing in Georgia and Florida, what we're hearing out of the mouths of politicians in Georgia and Florida, because we hear some of the same and very similar sentiment right here in Kentucky. We've seen the mailers that have gone out calling people radicals and trying to shame people and attack people, especially women who are running for office here in Kentucky. So we're not immune.\n\nAnd we're also not immune from attacks on our right to vote. I serve on the committee in Frankfort that pays attention to the elections and to our Constitution. And even this legislative session, we had Republican lawmakers asking about how do we protect the vote, but it was coded language, the way in which it was asked, about what we can do, future-wise, in taking away the right to vote. So we'd better pay attention, right here Kentucky, to what's happening right around us.\n\nI also have to say that we need to be mindful of the environment that we create, that allows hate to thrive. On Martin Luther King's weekend this year, Louisville allowed a gun show to happen here on that weekend. And this past weekend, a gun show happened right here in Louisville after the shootings at Kroger. And there were Christmas ornaments that were being sold with Nazi symbols and images on them. We are allowing that climate right here in Louisville, which is supposed to be a so-called liberal or progressive city. And when we allow that, we are nowhere near liberal or progressive.\n\nAnd we also need to make sure that we are passing policies that are designed to keep guns out of people's hands that should not have guns, and that we are very cautious about claiming that there's a mental health disorder that justifies hate and committing a hate crime. And that's too much of what I've been hearing these past three days about the shooter having a diagnosed mental health disorder. That is no excuse to kill two black people at a grocery store. And that is no excuse to try to break into a black church to commit crime. And it's all connected, whether it's the mail bombs or the murders at the synagogue, or whether it's Ms. Jones or Mr. Stallard being killed at Kroger. It's all connected. It's all part of a system that has been created in this country over time, and it's a system that we all need to work to dismantle.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both for being with us, Democratic state Representative Attica Scott of Kentucky, serving on the House Education Committee, in 2016 became the first African-American woman to serve in Kentucky's state Legislature in 20 years, and Reverend Vincent James, chief of community building for the city of Louisville, pastor of the Elim Baptist Church.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! When we come back, we'll talk about far-right violence, its connection to guns, white supremacist groups in this country. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

We speak with civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump about how William Bryan filmed Arbery jogging down a narrow road in Brunswick, Georgia, in broad daylight, before he was confronted by two armed white men - retired police officer Gregory McMichael and his son Travis - who shot him three times. \"This was never about any trespassing or burglary,\" Crump says. \"This was always about profiling Ahmaud Arbery because of the color of his skin.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Following weeks of outcry, authorities have arrested a third white man for the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old Black man who was chased down and shot to death February 23rd while on a job on a Sunday in Georgia. William Bryan was arrested Thursday on charges of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. He filmed the disturbing video showing Arbery jogging down a narrow road in Brunswick, Georgia, in broad daylight, before being confronted by two armed white men and shot three times.\n\nThe three men walked free for months after Arbery's murder. But after the video went viral and sparked mass outrage, Arbery's attackers - retired police officer Greg McMichael and his son Travis - were both arrested and charged with murder and aggravated assault earlier this month. Lee Merritt, the Arbery family attorney, said the video shows Arbery was chased by the McMichaels in their car for over four minutes before they killed him.\n\nGregory McMichael is a former Glynn County police officer who also worked as a prosecutorial investigator. Advocates say McMichael's ties to law enforcement shielded him from immediate arrest for Arbery's killing, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into Arbery's case for possible prosecutorial misconduct. Brunswick Judicial Circuit DA Jackie Johnson recused herself from the case because McMichael had worked in her office as an investigator. The Arbery case has passed through four district attorneys' offices.\n\nAhmaud Arbery was murdered after briefly entering a construction site. Texts uncovered over the weekend show a Glynn County police officer instructed the owner of the property to notify Greg McMichael if he noticed any trespassers. But surveillance video shows multiple people, a number of them white, entered the construction site to look around, but only Arbery was killed for the alleged trespassing. The homeowner Larry English's attorney has issued a statement that said, quote, \"It now appears that this young man may have been coming onto the property for water,\" unquote.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department says it will review the case to see if federal hate crime charges can be pursued. But such charges cannot be pursued by state authorities because Georgia is one of three Southern states that has no hate crime law.\n\nFor more, we go to Tallahassee, Florida, where we're joined by Ben Crump, civil rights attorney representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery. He's the author of Open Season: Legalized Genocide of Colored People .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Ben.  Can you start off by talking about the significance of the arrest of this third person? Usually, people who open their cellphone and start filming are hailed as the people who break a case. The film certainly provided the fodder for the arrests, months after Ahmaud was killed. But what about this man?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, as Ahmaud Arbery's family and my co-counsels have maintained from the beginning, we believe that William \"Roddie\" Bryan was part of this organized gang that was attempting, based on a premeditated plan, to confront and capture Ahmaud Arbery as he jogged through that community that day. And the text message that was sent by police officer Robert Rash to the homeowner, saying that, \"If you see him again, don't call the police. Call Gregory McMichael. He's a former police officer\" - so, we believe this was an organized mob that was planning on confronting Ahmaud. So it is wholly appropriate that he was arrested and charged.\n\nWhen you look at what Gregory McMichael said on day one, he said that Roddie attempted to cut off the jogger as he was running. And then we visually see objective evidence: For four minutes, they chase Ahmaud Arbery in that community as he tries to escape and run for his life. So, Ahmaud Arbery's family is very relieved, because they have maintained they want everybody who was part of this lynch mob, who executed their child, to be arrested and held accountable.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, this arrest came just after the raiding of the home of McMichael. Him and his son are in jail right now - McMichael, again, a former investigator and Glynn County police officer. Is that right? And what do you understand they found in the house?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, they have not revealed the contents of what they found in the house. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is set to have a press conference today at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. They may divulge some of that information if they can. But we do know that they are looking, based on what the family has tried to demand for equal justice for their son, connections between each and every person who was part of this lynch mob, this organized effort that was premeditated.\n\nAnd so, when you think about the charges of felony murder and criminal intent to commit false imprisonment, William \"Roddie\" Bryan is guilty of those charges, much in the same way if you have young people who make a miscalculated, stupid decision to go into a convenience store with the intent to rob the store, and you have somebody sitting in the car. Well, if a person is killed who's working at that store, everybody is charged. The person inside who did the shooting is charged with murder, and the person who was aiding and abetting, driving the car, is charged with felony murder. So, it's no different in this situation, when you think about how they executed Ahmaud Arbery and each and everybody who played a part in aiding and abetting in this crime.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to Kevin Gough, the attorney for William \"Roddie\" Bryan, speaking on Monday. He directed a message to you, Ben Crump, and S. Lee Merritt, saying you have put his client in danger.\n\nKEVIN GOUGH : I want to take a moment and speak directly to Benjamin Crump and S. Lee Merritt, two of the lawyers for the Arbery family. I'm not here tonight to argue with you about the evidence. I reached discreetly - I discreetly reached out previously through community leaders. I pleaded with you a week ago on national television. I do not know whether you have heard my pleas or whether you chose to ignore them, so I will try again. Mr. Bryan is not your enemy. My plea is this: Please stop. Please stop doing and saying things that place the lives of Roddie and his family in danger. Whether you realize it or not, y'all have put a target on his back. He is unarmed and defenseless - a sitting duck. I understand your passion and your zeal for justice, but, respectfully, the ends don't justify the means.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that was before he was arrested. That was the attorney. Ben Crump, your response?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Certainly. You know, since he made this plea directly to me and my Omega brother Lee Merritt, let me respond directly to him. Ahmaud Arbery was unarmed and defenseless when he was executed in broad daylight. And furthermore, since he says our calls for his client to be arrested somehow put his client in danger, we want him to know that the Arbery family is very relieved, and he can be very relieved, because the rule of law has prevailed and that his client was arrested based on evidence and probable cause. And he has no fear to worry about his client being in danger, because I am certain that he is safe in the Glynn County jail. And our clients, the Arbery family, would wish for him to remain safe and stay in the Glynn County jail for a long time, as they continue to push for justice for their son, Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Crump, the video keeps showing Ahmaud Arbery going into this construction site where a house is being built. But other video has been released that shows white people, over and over again, going into this construction site. You know, it's a house being built. It's completely open. A white couple, for example, that very day, walking in, sort of touring around.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Yes, ma'am. And that underscores the point that this was never about any trespassing or burglary. This was always about profiling Ahmaud Arbery because of the color of his skin. And we are requesting and imploring the federal Department of Justice to handle this matter as a hate crime. There can be a parallel prosecution with the state district attorney who's assigned to the case, as well as the Department of Justice, under the Shepard Hate Crime Act, because we believe Ahmaud Arbery was killed based on the color of his skin. He was lynched in 2020. And we have to send a message, not only to his family and community, but to the entire world, that, America, we are better than this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Crump, also, what about the Justice Department, the calls for them to open a hate crimes investigation into what happened? I mean, clearly, the two men, Greg McMichael and his son - Greg McMichael, former police officer, investigator - they walked free for months, before the video got out. The question of the corruption within the Glynn County, the district attorney, all of that, going - well, now the question of where the Justice Department is.\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Absolutely. We want the Justice Department to not only open a hate crime investigation, but we want them to look at the due process of law violations under the 14th Amendment involving everybody who was involved in this investigation, from the police officers who were first on the scene to the first DA, Jackie Johnson, who, it is alleged, told the police not to file charges in the case; to the second district attorney, Barnhill, who also said, like Jackie Johnson, he had a conflict of interest, but yet wrote a memorandum saying that he saw no probable cause to arrest this murderous father-and-son duo, and, in essence, put his thumb on the scales of justice in favor of the McMichaels; and the third prosecutor, who said when he looked at this video and he looked at all this evidence, the statements, said that he didn't feel he could arrest them, that he had to take it to a grand jury; and so, the Glynn County Sheriff's Department, who leaked the video of Ahmaud Arbery from three years prior, we believe, in an attempt to assassinate his character, as well as Robert Rash, the police officer who sent the text to the homeowner that condoned and encouraged this vigilante mob to capture and confront Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Shaun King said yesterday classmates of Travis McMichael said he was the single most racist man they ever knew and that when they heard he had been involved in this, they were not shocked.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In response to Ellison's shooting, civil rights advocate and attorney Ben Crump wrote on Twitter, \"this was NOT about music. That's false justification for killing a Black teen! This was a racially motivated shooting by a suspected white supremacist!!\""

The five-count indictment accuses Roland Bourgeois of plotting to defend his Algiers Point neighborhood in New Orleans from \"outsiders\" including African Americans and shooting and seriously wounding three men who were walking toward a temporary evacuation center. [includes rush transcript]\n\nSHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS : Nearly five years after Hurricane Katrina, federal prosecutors have charged a white man with federal hate crimes for his role in the racially motivated shooting of three black men in the aftermath of the storm. The five-count indictment, unsealed last week, accuses Roland Bourgeois of plotting to defend his Algiers Point neighborhood in New Orleans from, quote, \"outsiders,\" including African Americans, and shooting and seriously wounding Donnell Herrington, Marcel Alexander and Chris Collins, who were walking toward a temporary evacuation center. A joint reporting project by the Times-Picayune , ProPublica and PBS Frontline interviewed people this year who implicated Bourgeois in the shooting. Terri Benjamin was an eyewitness to the shooting and told reporter A.C. Thompson what she saw and heard on September 1st of 2005. A.C. THOMPSON : I want you to tell me about the incident that occurred in your neighborhood a couple days after the storm hit. TERRI BENJAMIN : I heard the gun, the gunshot, so we started running towards my house, because I had family in the house, and we didn't know what, you know, that gunshot was all about, if everybody was OK. And we ran up, and my neighbor was jumping up and down, hooting and hollering like he was big game hunting and he got the big one. And all of his friends were rallying him on, and they were cheering. And he screamed, \"I got one!\" And I went to him, and I said, \"What? Got one what?\" And he said, \"A looter.\" One of his friends comes running up the street and said, \"You got one, but he ain't dead yet.\" And he proceeded to run, with no shoes on, around the corner, wherever this man was laying down. After, I asked him - I said, \"Roland, you don't have to kill him. He's already down. Just leave him alone. He's going to die anyway. Just leave him alone.\" And he said, \"I'm going to kill that nigger.\" And he went around that corner, and we heard the shot. I didn't see him shoot him, but I felt it. When he came back from shooting that man the second time, he at that point got this adrenaline rush in him, and he turned into somebody that I knew I couldn't negotiate with very much further. He turned into an animal. It was like he got the taste of blood, and he was out for more. And I went to him and asked him to spare my cousin and my uncle's life, who are African American, that would be walking up that street. And at that point, I knew it wasn't safe for anything not white to walk up that street. And my neighbor looked at me and said, \"Darling, anything coming up that street darker than a brown paper bag is getting shot.\" SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS : Well, earlier last week, the Justice Department indicted six current and former New Orleans police officers for their role in another post-Katrina shooting incident: the Danziger Bridge shootings and subsequent cover-up. Just days after Hurricane Katrina, a group of officers shot six people, killing two. The slain victims, forty-two-year-old Ronald Madison and nineteen-year-old James Brissette, had been searching for food. Madison, who was mentally handicapped, was shot seven times, five in the back. Attorney General Eric Holder helped unveil the charges Tuesday in New Orleans. ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER : The Justice Department will hold those who violate the law responsible for their actions. Put simply, we will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who are sworn to protect the public. This will not stand. And we will hold all offenders accountable. AMY GOODMAN : For more on the federal investigation into what's occurred in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we're joined here in New York by a reporter who exposed key details about both the Algiers Point and the Danziger Bridge shootings. A.C. Thompson, a staff reporter at ProPublica, has been working on an ongoing series for PBS Frontline and the Times-Picayune on these shootings in New Orleans. Welcome again to Democracy Now! , A.C. When you were here in April, this story of Roland Bourgeois was about to drop, was about to explode. So explain the latest on what's happened to him. A.C. THOMPSON : So, the federal government is saying there is a five-count indictment against Mr. Bourgeois, and it alleges that he was part of a group of people, a conspiracy of people, that ran for about two weeks to prevent African Americans from moving down the street to the Algiers Point neighborhood, and that they used force and threats of force to keep those African American people out of this neighborhood, which is largely white. AMY GOODMAN : You know, when we were down after the hurricane, we went to a multicultural center, and there was a dead man there. And we did a whole piece on him. And I'm now wondering if he was ever identified. A.C. THOMPSON : You know, that's an unanswered question about this whole incident, is the government is saying, look, more than one person was involved in this, and it wasn't just Donnell Herrington, Chris Collins and Marcel Alexander who got shot, or it wasn't just them that were threatened. We believe that more people were threatened with violence, or perhaps were victims of violence. And we don't know who else yet might have been shot, injured or killed during that time period. But there are worrisome signs, like that body that was there; like the people who have told me, \"Oh, I saw two or three or four bodies, that I believe to have been shot, laying around that area\"; and like the people like Reggie Bell, who said to me, \"I was threatened, walking through this neighborhood to my house. I'm an African American man. These white men with guns repeatedly threatened me and told me to get out of this neighborhood.\" SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS : And it's astounding, this clip we heard of the eyewitness, Roland Bourgeois's neighbor, Terri Benjamin, saying that he fired the shots, then went back and said he's going to kill this person. Can you just explain exactly what happened? A.C. THOMPSON : What Terri told me is, she said the incident unfolded like this. She heard a shot, and she ran to the intersection where she had lived, and she saw a group of men there. One of them was Roland Bourgeois. And he was told, \"Oh, the guy that you just shot, he survived.\" And so, Mr. Bourgeois, according to Benjamin, ran after this person, who was around the corner, and went to shoot him again. Now, we now know that that person was Donnell Herrington, according to the federal indictment and according to my reporting, and he survived. But her allegation is Bourgeois went to kill him. And what the federal government is saying in its indictment is he came back with a bloody baseball cap that Donnell Herrington had been wearing, that had been on his head, and showed it around to people. And it sounds like he waved it around like it was a trophy. AMY GOODMAN : Where does this case go from now? We've got the two, the police shootings and this. A.C. THOMPSON : You know, what we're going to see is, there's the possibility that we'll see more indictments in this matter. Like I said, it's not - there is a conspiracy alleged here, but only one person has been charged so far. And then, when it comes to the police shootings, there were at least eleven people who were shot in the week after Hurricane Katrina by police officers. What we've seen are charges against sixteen current and former officers in two cases: the Danziger Bridge case and the case of Henry Glover, who was allegedly shot and was definitely burnt up, allegedly by police. What we may see is further charges in cases involving Danny Brumfield, who was shot in the back by police; Matt McDonald, who was shot in the back; and, as well, Keenon McCann, who was shot and survived. We know those cases are under investigation; we don't know if there'll be charges yet. AMY GOODMAN : We have ten seconds. Why did it take the Justice Department, what, more than five years to do this? Did it all come from your reports? A.C. THOMPSON : You know, in part, the Justice Department got into these cases because they saw media reports, including mine, that suggested something was out there. And now, to a certain extent, they chasing these stories, because local authorities have not. AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you, A.C.

These white men with guns repeatedly threatened me and told me to get out of this neighborhood.\" SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS : And it's astounding, this clip we heard of the eyewitness, Roland Bourgeois's neighbor, Terri Benjamin, saying that he fired the shots, then went back and said he's going to kill this person. Can you just explain exactly what happened? A.C. THOMPSON : What Terri told me is, she said the incident unfolded like this. She heard a shot, and she ran to the intersection where she had lived, and she saw a group of men there. One of them was Roland Bourgeois. And he was told, \"Oh, the guy that you just shot, he survived.\" And so, Mr. Bourgeois, according to Benjamin, ran after this person, who was around the corner, and went to shoot him again. Now, we now know that that person was Donnell Herrington, according to the federal indictment and according to my reporting, and he survived. But her allegation is Bourgeois went to kill him. And what the federal government is saying in its indictment is he came back with a bloody baseball cap that Donnell Herrington had been wearing, that had been on his head, and showed it around to people. And it sounds like he waved it around like it was a trophy. AMY GOODMAN : Where does this case go from now? We've got the two, the police shootings and this. A.C. THOMPSON : You know, what we're going to see is, there's the possibility that we'll see more indictments in this matter. Like I said, it's not - there is a conspiracy alleged here, but only one person has been charged so far. And then, when it comes to the police shootings, there were at least eleven people who were shot in the week after Hurricane Katrina by police officers. What we've seen are charges against sixteen current and former officers in two cases: the Danziger Bridge case and the case of Henry Glover, who was allegedly shot and was definitely burnt up, allegedly by police. What we may see is further charges in cases involving Danny Brumfield, who was shot in the back by police; Matt McDonald, who was shot in the back; and, as well, Keenon McCann, who was shot and survived. We know those cases are under investigation; we don't know if there'll be charges yet. AMY GOODMAN : We have ten seconds. Why did it take the Justice Department, what, more than five years to do this? Did it all come from your reports? A.C. THOMPSON : You know, in part, the Justice Department got into these cases because they saw media reports, including mine, that suggested something was out there. And now, to a certain extent, they chasing these stories, because local authorities have not. AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you, A.C. Thompson, for all that you've done, staff reporter at ProPublica, working on an ongoing series for PBS Frontline and Times-Picayune on the post-Katrina shootings in New Orleans.\n\nWelcome again to Democracy Now! , A.C. When you were here in April, this story of Roland Bourgeois was about to drop, was about to explode. So explain the latest on what's happened to him. A.C. THOMPSON : So, the federal government is saying there is a five-count indictment against Mr. Bourgeois, and it alleges that he was part of a group of people, a conspiracy of people, that ran for about two weeks to prevent African Americans from moving down the street to the Algiers Point neighborhood, and that they used force and threats of force to keep those African American people out of this neighborhood, which is largely white. AMY GOODMAN : You know, when we were down after the hurricane, we went to a multicultural center, and there was a dead man there. And we did a whole piece on him. And I'm now wondering if he was ever identified. A.C. THOMPSON : You know, that's an unanswered question about this whole incident, is the government is saying, look, more than one person was involved in this, and it wasn't just Donnell Herrington, Chris Collins and Marcel Alexander who got shot, or it wasn't just them that were threatened. We believe that more people were threatened with violence, or perhaps were victims of violence. And we don't know who else yet might have been shot, injured or killed during that time period. But there are worrisome signs, like that body that was there; like the people who have told me, \"Oh, I saw two or three or four bodies, that I believe to have been shot, laying around that area\"; and like the people like Reggie Bell, who said to me, \"I was threatened, walking through this neighborhood to my house.

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWe play a video that has now gone viral from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where community activist Gary Chambers Jr. calls out members of the Lee High School school board for their racism during a June 18 meeting to discuss a resolution to rename the school, which is named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Chambers urged members to choose a name in honor of people who fought slavery and racism, not someone who defended it, and addressed board member Connie Bernard, who had defended Robert E. Lee and was seen shopping on her computer during the meeting.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to talk about the issue of lynching in this country - I'm not talking about a hundred years ago, but now - in a moment, but first I want to go to a video that has gone viral. We're turning to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a video of a well-known community activist calling out members of the school board for their racism has gone viral. The board was meeting to discuss a resolution to change the name of Lee High School, named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. This is Gary Chambers Jr. addressing the board member Connie Bernard after he noticed she was online shopping during the meeting. Bernard can be seen walking out as Chambers speaks.\n\nGARY CHAMBERS JR.: So, I had intended to get up here and talk about how racist Robert E. Lee was, but I'm going to talk about you, Connie, sitting over there shopping while we're talking about Robert E. Lee. This is a picture of you shopping, while we're talking about racism and history in this country. Only white members of this board got up while we were up here talking, too, because you don't give a damn, and it's clear.\n\nBut I'm going to tell you what the slaves, my ancestors, said about Robert E. Lee, since you don't know history, sister. Let me tell you that they said, when he got the plantation, after he got off the field where 27,000 people died, at Gettysburg, Connie - Robert E. Lee was a brutal slave master. Not only did, when he whooped the slaves, he say, \"Lay it on 'em hard,\" after he said, \"Lay it on 'em hard,\" he said, \"Put brine on them,\" so to burn them. That's what Robert E. Lee did.\n\nAnd you sit your arrogant self in here and sit on there shopping, while the pain and the hurt of the people of this community is on display, because you don't give a damn, and you should resign! You should have resigned two years ago, when you choked a white man in his house. You should have resigned two weeks ago, when you got on TV and said foolishness. And you should walk out of here and resign and never come back, because you are the example of racism in this community. You are horrible.\n\nNow to the rest of the board. You have an obligation to the people of this community, and 81% of them are Black. And do you need a Klan rally outside, Mr. Gaudet, before you end it? Because holding it up means that you put that building in jeopardy. You do, sir, because all over the country, they're burning stuff down. And Black folks in this city have stood with protesters. I ain't seen you elected officials out there with them, making sure that nothing goes south in Baton Rouge. It's been folks in this community who give a damn, not just when it's comfortable, but every time. And four years ago, we came down here.\n\nMr. Drake, they say you're a good man. Be a good man. Black folks say you're a good man. White folks say you're a good man. Your legacy is attached to tonight, brother. Your legacy.\n\nNow, let me say to the Black members of the board, it's the most solidarity I done seen out of y'all in forever. Let's keep at that. Let's stand on this, moving forward, because we don't need to apologize for Connie, Evelyn. She showed you who she was when she was sitting next to you while you were talking, shopping. You don't need another example.\n\nNow, when do we, as Baton Rouge, stop being in 1856? If you want to name the building after somebody, how about P.B.S. Pinchback, the first Black governor of the state of Louisiana, when he was governor during Reconstruction? You want another name? Oscar Dunn, who was the lieutenant governor of the state of Louisiana in the 1860s, that gave the right for Dadrius Lanus and Dawn Collins and Evelyn Ware-Jackson and Tramelle Howard to get here. You want to name it after somebody from Reconstruction? Name it after the people who fought for abolition of slavery. If you want to name it after somebody, honor the right people, the people who were on the right side of history.\n\nBut it's your ancestor that the school is named after, so you're holding onto your heritage.

Their aim was to destroy Black political and economic power and overthrow the city's democratically elected, Reconstruction-era multiracial government, paving the way for the implementation of Jim Crow law just two years later. We feature excerpts from the documentary and speak to co-director Yoruba Richen, who explains how the insurrection was planned and carried out, and how the filmmakers worked to track down the descendants of both perpetrators and victims, whose voices are featured in the film.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nA new film is premiering tonight on PBS on the largely erased history of a coup to overthrow the elected government of the Black-majority North Carolina city of Wilmington three decades after the Civil War. This is the trailer for American Coup: Wilmington 1898 .\n\nPEYTON HOGE : [dramatized] We have taken a city as thoroughly, as completely, as if captured in battle.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : It was the only armed overthrow of an elected government.\n\nLERAE SIKES UMFLEET : We really don't know how many people were murdered that day.\n\nKIERAN HAILE : Whole families have broken up and scattered. The homes, representing their savings, are deserted.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED : I've always felt like this story was always meant to be told.\n\nALEX MANLY : [dramatized] In North Carolina, the Negro holds the balance of power.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : There was really no other major city in the South like Wilmington.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : You have the Black leadership with college degrees.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : And there was a professional class there.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : Doctors and teachers and lawyers.\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : White vendors were having to compete with Black vendors for customers. And Black men were able to hold public office at multiple levels of government. Wilmington is essentially a promised land for African Americans.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : It was a different vision of what American democracy could be, that it could actually be multiracial and work.\n\nALFRED MOORE WADDELL : [dramatized] Men, do your duty. This city, county and state shall be rid of Negro domination once and forever.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : The Confederacy was trying to take power back.\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : And white supremacy is going to be the rallying cry.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : So, leaders of the conspiracy turned to actually taking over the city government at gunpoint.\n\nLERAE SIKES UMFLEET : A definition of a coup d'état is an armed overthrew of a legally elected government, which is what happened on this day in Wilmington.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : This was a coup based on the devaluation of African American citizenship. You think about the loss of wealth, the stealing of their generational legacies. What Wilmington tells us is how fragile American democracy is.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The trailer for American Coup: Wilmington 1898 . We're going to speak to the director, but first this clip lays out how Wilmington was the largest city in North Carolina in 1898. Black people held many positions in government alongside white people.\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : The removal of troops from the South ushered in the end of Reconstruction, and white supremacists are once again able to regain power.\n\nLERAE SIKES UMFLEET : Democrats and Republicans of 1898 are not the Democrats and Republicans of the 21st century.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Remember, what we had coming out of the Civil War was that Lincoln was a Republican, and the Republican Party was founded on an anti-slavery platform.\n\nLERAE SIKES UMFLEET : That meant that most African American voters were going to vote for the Republican candidates.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : The Democrats were the Klan members. The Democrats were the slaveowners, the enslavers. They were deeply committed to the denying citizenship rights to African Americans.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : The Democratic Party holds the state in the 1870s throughout the 1880s. It's really not until the 1890s that you begin to see the Democrats again lose their power. There's a depression that takes place in 1893. White farmers are suffering.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : These white farmers felt that the Democratic Party was beholden to the banks and the railroads and the moneyed interests.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : And they bolt from the Democrats and join the Populists, which is a third party.\n\nLERAE SIKES UMFLEET : Neither the Republican Party nor the Populist Party had the voting power to unseat Democratic Party candidates if they were running in a tripart election.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : So they form an alliance, white Populists and Black and white Republicans. This became known as fusion.\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : We see a political alliance between African Americans and working-class white people.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : The Populists were as racist as any of the members of the Democratic Party, but their economic interests were so strong that they were able to set that aside.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : It's not some kumbaya moment. We've got to be really clear about that. It was a pragmatic moment.\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : So, both in 1894 and in 1896, this fusionist coalition of Black and white men are able to sweep the North Carolina General Assembly.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : North Carolina elects a fusion governor, Daniel Russell. They send George White to Congress. And they start to pull back all the things that the Democrats did to reduce democracy. So, for example, the positions that were once appointed in Wilmington are now turned into elected positions, which allows Black people to run for office.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : It created, really, a situation in Wilmington that was unique. You had Black men in positions of authority and power.\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : So we see Black and white men on the Board of Aldermen. We see Black and white men serving in various municipal offices.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : Ten of the 26 policemen were Black men, the city treasurer, the city jailer, the city coroner. John C. Dancy was the custom collector at the port, which is a federally appointed position. He made $4,000 a year, which was $1,000 more than the governor made.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : The mayor of Wilmington is also a fusion candidate. It's not the majority of Black, it's the majority fusion that makes the difference.\n\nKIDADA WILLIAMS : So, with Wilmington by 1898, African Americans had still held on to a lot of the rights and privileges and the institutions and the power they had enjoyed.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : It was a land of possibility, a land of hope, a different vision of what American democracy could be, that it could actually be multiracial and work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That last voice, Carol Anderson, Emory professor. And this is another clip from American Coup: Wilmington 1898 that describes an editorial in Wilmington's Black newspaper, The Daily Record , before the coup.\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : Rebecca Felton, she was the wife of a congressman in Georgia. She gave a speech to the agricultural society condemning white men for, in her mind, not doing enough to stop the Black beast rapists and this supposed rape epidemic in Georgia. There was no rape epidemic, but she created one. White supremacist newspapers in Wilmington realized they could make something of this, so they reprinted her speech in August of 1898. And as soon as Alex Manly saw that, he sat down and wrote an editorial in response to Mrs. Felton.\n\nKIERAN HAILE : \"Mrs. Felton from Georgia makes a speech before the agricultural society at Tybee, Georgia, in which she advocates lynching as an extreme measure.\"\n\nALEX MANLY : [dramatized] Experience among poor white people in the country teaches us that women of that race are not more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with colored men that are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind go on for some time until the woman's infatuation or the man's boldness bring attention to them, and the man is lynched for rape.\n\nEvery negro lynched is called a big burly black brute. When in fact, many of those who have thus been dealt with, have had white men for their fathers, and were not only not black and burly, but were sufficiently attractive for the white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them.\n\nKIERAN HAILE : \"Tell your men that it is no worse for a Black man to be intimate with a white woman than for a white man to be intimate with a colored woman. Don't think ever that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours.\" Alex Manly editorial, Daily Record , August 18th, 1898.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : This was blasphemous. You know, to say that a white woman could actually desire a Black man? What?\n\nDAVID ZUCCHINO : The other point he made was that for generations, white men had been raping Black women with impunity, and that had been going on forever, and nobody talks about that.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Alexander Manly's rebuttal to Rebecca Felton was absolutely courageous. He didn't say it behind closed doors while he's talking with his friends. He did it in an editorial published in The Daily Record that has white advertisers. I mean, so he's really putting himself out there. You had some members of the Black community who were like, \"Oh, Manly? Manly doesn't speak for us.\"\n\nCRYSTAL SANDERS : There were many who perhaps, even if they believed it was true, thought that it was, you know, too inflammatory to be printed. We also see prominent Black men in Wilmington urge Manly to recant the editorial, to apologize, in an effort to avoid conflict. He refuses. He sees himself as someone who has done nothing wrong. He has spoken a truth that he believes has gone unspoken for too long.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : American Coup: Wilmington 1898 premieres tonight on PBS and will also stream online. We're joined by the co-director, Yoruba Richen, award-winning filmmaker.\n\nYoruba, welcome back to Democracy Now!\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : Thank you, Amy. Thanks for having me.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Yoruba, I wanted to start off by asking you - the Manly editorial became the basis for the first attack of the white supremacists, when they burned down his newspaper. Can you talk about - and again, they were spurred on by the editor and publisher of the white-owned News & Observer . Talk about the role of that publisher, as well.\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : Absolutely. So, the editorial that we just saw was used as the spark to, you know, go into action. But this coup had been planned meticulously in the months leading up to it. It was planned by a group called the Secret Nine, otherwise known as the Chamber - you know, very prominent members of the Chamber of Commerce. And they were self-styled, self-called white supremacists. And it was led by Josephus Daniels, who was the editor of The News & Observer in Raleigh. And the newspaper had published continually this idea, this racist idea, of Black men raping white women and of bad government that Negroes were in charge of, and that if we continued - you know, if they continued to let this happen, white women would be debased and continue to be raped, an epidemic of rape.\n\nAnd that's what you saw, you know, the Rebecca Felton newspaper - her speech reprinted in the newspaper, and Manly responding and saying, \"No, that's not true,\" and debunking that. And it was that editorial that was - that they said, you know, \"Look what happens when Negroes are in rule. Look at the things that they can say. We've got to get rid of them. We've got to get rid of this newspaper.\" And that was the spur for the attack. But it had been planned many months before the actual events happened.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in making the film, you not only went into the archival records, but you made a decision to locate and interview both white and Black descendants of families that were involved in the events at the time. Could you talk about that?\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : Absolutely. My co-director and I, that was one of the first things that we knew we wanted to include in the film. We found out that a group of Black descendants and, really, one white descendant had been meeting for about a year before we started the production, through an organization called Coming to the Table, which is a national organization that deals - that brings Blacks and whites together dealing with racial issues. And they had been meeting. And we were able to meet them through that organization, attend those meetings and start to create a relationship with some of the descendants who you see in the film. And then we did work to find more descendants, particularly more white descendants, because they were harder to locate or to invite to come and be a part of the film. And we're very grateful for their participation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And one of the white descendants was the descendant of the newspaper editor, right?\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : Absolutely, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And he and the other descendants took down his statue.\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : Yes, yes. So, The News & Observer , up until the 1960s, was the paper that we saw in 1890s. And then there was a change. And the family recently took down the statue, I think in about 2020. And, you know, Frank was a part of it. He is in the film admitting to what his ancestor did and the harm that it produced not only to North Carolina but to the nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what happened, actually? What did all of this lead up to? How many people died?\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : So, you know, we'll never know the numbers, the exact numbers. They weren't - you know, they weren't taking it down. But it's said that it was maybe 200 to 300, but it was probably more than that, you can imagine. Black people were run into - ran into the swamps. One of the - Alfred Waddell, one of the leaders, said, \"We'll choke Cape Fear with their bodies.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : And then it returned to - and, sorry, then it became a majority-white city. And two years later, Jim Crow was instituted, and there was not another Black person elected from the state of North Carolina 'til 1992.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wow. It is an amazing film, and I encourage people to watch it. It premieres tonight on PBS and also live-streamed. Yoruba Richen is co-director of American Coup: Wilmington 1898 . That does it for our show. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. This is Democracy Now!\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

These nine House managers have assembled video and other evidence detailing Trump's months-long campaign of lies claiming the 2020 election was stolen, and his consistent encouragement of violence, leading up to the Capitol attack. Their case has been methodical and comprehensive, but leaves largely untouched a fundamental feature of the insurrection: white supremacy. Even if at least 67 Senators vote to convict Trump for the single charge of incitement of insurrection and more than half vote to ban him from ever again holding public office, this trial will not advance the struggle in this country to overcome systemic racism.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol would be an appropriate location to launch an antiracist movement. Soaring rhetoric has filled the hallowed halls for more than two centuries, extolling liberty, freedom, justice, and equality. Yet, as we were reminded Wednesday by Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, the delegate representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, one of the House impeachment managers, \"This capitol that was conceived by our founding fathers...was built by slaves.\"\n\nThroughout the videos of the Trump-incited mob rampaging through the building, many with Confederate and Nazi flags and other white supremacist symbols, we catch glimpses of the famous Rotunda, the Crypt beneath it, and Statuary Hall. Each of the fifty states sends two statues to the Capitol, and they are placed throughout the complex, as Statuary Hall can only accommodate 35 of them. Of the 22 statues from the eleven Confederate states, at least 15 were slave owners, and ten of those remaining were Confederate officers or officials.\n\nLast June, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to the Joint Committee on the Library, which manages Statuary Hall, asking that statues of Confederates be removed. The law, however, requires the states that sent the statues to approve any removal or replacement.\n\nVirginia agreed, and removed its statue of General Robert E. Lee, leader of the Confederate Army. A statue of African American student organizer Barbara Johns will be put in its place. As a teen, Johns organized a strike at her high school, protesting the wretched conditions of her segregated school. A legal case followed, becoming part of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in public schools.\n\n\"It took the Civil War between the Union and the Confederate States of America for slavery to end,\" Professor Ibram X. Kendi said on the Democracy Now! news hour. \"The vice president of the Confederates was Alexander Stephens, who, last I checked, has a statue in Statuary Hall. Stephens said that this Confederacy is founded on the 'great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man,' and 'slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.'\"\n\nIt's not just dead Confederates in the Capitol. North Carolina honors Charles Brantley Aycock, who was just a child during the Civil War. Aycock devoted his life to white supremacy. He was a lead organizer of the Wilmington Massacre of 1898, when a white mob of 2,000 armed racists attacked the elected, biracial local government, destroyed businesses, including the only Black-owned daily newspaper in the country, and killed between 60 and 300 Black residents. Aycock's punishment? He was elected governor of North Carolina, then pushed through laws that disenfranchised African Americans.\n\nThere are also many statues honoring so-called Founding Fathers who were slave owners, among them George Washington, and Northerners Jonathan Trumbull of Connecticut and George Clinton, the first governor of New York.\n\nHistory professors Kendi and Keisha Blain have just published a remarkable anthology titled, \"Four Hundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019.\" It brings together 80 prominent African American writers, scholars and activists, each of whom contributed an essay covering a 5-year span from those 400 years of African American history.\n\n\"We were really thinking about how do we connect past to the present,\" Blain said, explaining that the book, \"helps us contextualize the history and to see some of the challenges that remain even to this day, how it connects to the period of slavery.\"\n\nAfter Trump's racist supporters with their Confederate flags were cleared from the Capitol, leaving five dead and over 140 police officers injured, the National Guard moved in. Several African American soldiers posed for a photo with one of the Capitol's newest statues, that of Rosa Parks. These memorials matter.\n\nThe Senate should convict Ex-President Donald Trump. But the root causes of the insurrection, racism and white supremacy, that Trump has embraced and exploited his whole life, will require far more work to overcome.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Beware Of The Average White Man\n\nP.L. Thomas , professor of education (Furman University, Greenville, SC), is author of Beware the Roadbuilders and Trumplandia (Garn Press).\n\nWhat if there is a reckoning for average white men?\n\nLooking back on my youth, I lived through and enjoyed in pop culture both the Average White Band and The White Shadow -as a teen, without an ounce of critical awareness, and as an average white boy, without a clue of my own blinding privilege.\n\nAs I entered college, the Reagan revolution occurred, and I recall vividly being drawn to the allure of reverse racism, the vapid claim that white men were somehow then the victims of a multicultural and gender revolution.\n\nRapidly approaching 60, I am both ashamed and more fully aware of who I was in my youth-a person I reject entirely but witness daily in teenaged and early adult white guys that I teach. One first-year student just wrote an essay-one I could have written myself at his age-passionately arguing he is not privileged even though every single example he offered (white, male, affluent parents) confirmed his privilege. His argument also bemoaned the \"new\" definition of privilege, a garbled argument at best, and railed against his belief that those with privilege today are being \"criminalized.\"\n\nJuxtaposing my youthful ignorance in the cocoon of privilege with this student's same delusion more than three decades later while the US watches as a parade of powerful and famous (often white) men are exposed for truly inexcusable behavior toward women and girls speaks to a disturbing warning: beware average white men.\n\nNext, I'd like to juxtapose Garrison Keillor to a truism that almost every black person has been told repeatedly in their youth:\n\nWork twice as hard to attain half as much -what a horrible way to navigate the world, so pervasive that entire communities teach this to their children.\n\nKeillor is among the newly fallen-though his sin tempered as \"improper behavior\" -and like Al Franken, Richard Dreyfuss, and Matt Lauer, Keillor's response is itself a hedge: \"The story of his alleged misdeeds is 'more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard,' Keillor wrote.\"\n\nGarrison Keillor represents more than the recent unmasking of \"improper behavior\" among powerful men.\n\nAmong this new normal, these partial admissions among the Left stand in stark contrast to a Republican president elected in the wake of his own profane bragging about being a sexual predator and a Republican senate candidate receiving a standing ovation while visiting a church after being exposed for his own open secret-his predatory habits including girls as young as 14.\n\nMyself white, male, and affluent/privileged in many ways grounded in those first two accidents of my birth-I am deeply burdened by the question that lies before us about the essential nature of men, of whiteness: Can these revelations about how many powerful men are monsters be traced to predispositions of being born a male, to some code engrained in whiteness (even as we know race is a social, not a biological, construct)?\n\nI am afraid of the truth about being male, about the flawed consequences of being a creature driven by testosterone even with the capacity for reason, compassion, and ethical awareness.\n\nI am terrified about the inability to determine cause and effect among the dynamics of being male, white, and powerful -that white men have disproportionate power may allow being white and male to be absolved, may allow us all to decry the corrosive impact of power.\n\nIt is that terror that brings me back to Keillor as much more illustrative of the converse of how blacks raise their children-twice as good, half as much: the average white man is allowed to be half as good to attain twice as much.\n\n\"I am disappointed in both reviews of Garrison Keillor's anthology Good Poems (April 2004)-nearly as much as in the anthology itself,\" wrote poet Rita Dove in 2005, explaining:\n\nDove's last charge reminds me of religious traditions that suggest God created man in His own image- the sexist language and the arrogance.\n\nDove's last charge reminds me of the much smaller scale but none the less arrogant self-aggrandizing of the New Criticism movement-white men with literary power who manufactured standards of great literature both to match the sort of work they created but also to keep the evaluative gaze on the text (and thus, not on the white-male-only club they were creating, and that Keillor shamelessly perpetuated).\n\nCould anyone be more mediocre than Matt Lauer, who earned $25,000,000 a year? Maybe Keillor, the grand patron of mediocrity.\n\nAnd how does a country elect Barack Obama (twice as hard, half as much) and then Donald Trump -a man who can only aspire to Lauer's and Keillor's mediocrity, a man buoyed by his father's ill-gotten wealth and a culture that allows wealthy white men to excel despite their mediocrity and moral decadence.\n\nKeillor may too easily be swept aside as a mostly harmless minor celebrity, a victim himself of his era when men's behavior toward women was seen as part of a normal \"consensual seduction ritual,\" Dreyfuss's own effort to excuse himself as simply being \"the kind of performative masculine man my father had modeled for me to be.\"\n\nSin's of the father and all that.\n\nBut Keillor represents more than the existential fear all women and girls must fear from all men as potential physical and sexual threats; Keillor is the quintessential average white man who is half as much but reaps twice the benefits on the wave of his privileges.\n\nAnd yet as the veneer is being peeled back from men as predatory monsters, average white men themselves are desperately asking what if things are going too far, what if all the men guilty of sexual assault and intimidation are held accountable.\n\nYes, what if? Reckoning is a frightening thing for the guilty, and each time I read about another man hedging for the accused and punished, I am reminded, with some due gender irony, \"The lady protests too much, methinks.\"\n\nToday the white male student who wrote the ham-fisted essay about privilege conferenced with me about his essay, and I was struck by how even though he is identified as privileged, he is confronted with a different world than I was. In another first-year class, a black young woman came into class upset about Lauer; she immediately said she was disappointed.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Twerking and drinking took its toll and led to empty stomachs, so at 3 a.m. we called ourselves an Uber . The driver was kind and the ride over was so pleasant that we asked him to dine with us. We'd picked up a new friend! Epic nights always begin like this.\n\nHis name was Drew.\n\nHe sat next to me at the restaurant and eventually my friends huddled into their own conversation, leaving him and me to fend for ourselves. Good and easy conversation kept us afloat freely, with stories of passport stamps to philosophies. He dropped us off at our hotel, and smoothly asked for my number.\n\nThe girls giggled. I blushed... and obliged.\n\nThe texting... the calls... the crush began. And then, our first date. What started off as brunch, where we both confessed our intentional avoidance of commitment, turned into 10 hours of non-stop fun, intriguing conversation, and the occasional 3rd chakra palpitating gaze. The date ended with an impressive kiss (we made out). I welcomed his tenacity.\n\nBecause after leaving a \"good\" job, moving to a new state and leaving behind people who love me, switching my spacious waterfront apartment for my aunt's back bedroom/office, and getting a part-time holiday job at Nordstrom just to keep gas in my Honda, I'd 'bout maximized my fears and delighted in an opportunity for some revelry.\n\n\"My roommates ... were shocked in the morning to learn that my company was White. But they weren't just shocked. They were livid, disgusted even.\"\n\nFebruary came, as did the yearning. I moved into a beautiful and spacious loft with a couple I'd met some weeks before. Drew was there on moving day, lugging the heaviest furniture as family looked on. He stayed over a few nights later, and at a point late in the evening he confessed that he loved me.\n\nA record screeched and stopped in my head.\n\nWhat in the hell?! You don't even know me. You can't love me.\n\nI don't have to know you to feel you.\n\nThe morning after, I had an early meeting at work and left him to sleep until I returned. He looked so good, asleep in my bed. The morning was cold and bright; the sun was on his cheek. And I watched him lie there, breathing. I smiled to myself, thinking that life was finally turning around -- back in my own place again, with a new handsome gentleman -- and headed off to what could be a new career. I wrote him a poem to read when he woke up, then left.\n\nBy my return two hours later, all hell had broken loose.\n\nMy roommates, who knew I'd had company that night, were shocked in the morning to learn that my company was White. But they weren't just shocked. They were livid, disgusted even.\n\nWe don't want to share a bathroom with White people.\n\nWe don't want to be under the same roof with White people.\n\nAnd, we're shocked that you would be with someone who's White, because... you're conscious.\n\nConscious. That bastardized word, often representing spiritual awareness, somehow has become synonymous in a sub-culture of the Black community with natural hair and extended conversations about the pineal gland. And exclusion. It was my fault, I suppose... I did wear a shaved head, and do use an Akan name. And the beads... the beads throw everybody off, right?\n\nThus, while I was indeed really Black, I still wasn't quite Black enough.\n\nI moved out at month's end.\n\nIt's true that I grew up as a black girl child in the American South, and had defining experiences with racism. I've been called nigger, been a petting zoo, and been harassed by the police. In part, I went to an HBCU because many of my early experiences with White peoples wasn't so good.\n\nAnd it's true that, as a dark-skinned girl in the American South, I was a victim of colorism in my own community because my dark was too dark. I was called many names, including Crunchy Black, and Miss Black-Ass America (after I started winning pageants). There were skin shade comparisons. People often volunteered their confusion with my attractiveness versus my skin tone -- they somehow didn't belong together. In part, I left The South because I felt very ostracized.\n\nWhen I moved to Mozambique for the summer in 2008, my life flipped upside down. I returned from Africa a new person, and sampled Black Nationalism and Afrocentricity in an effort to extend the life I'd fallen for. But the ostracization of God's other children to account for centuries of racial injustice still didn't work for me.\n\nThe rumor stream began that I was dating a White man. Then the questions came. And so did my answers.\n\nQ: Does he try to act Black? Does he wear gold chains?\n\nA: Really??\n\nQ: Oooo! He took you to dinner? I need to get me a White man!\n\nA: Or perhaps just a good man will do. Because good men also like dinner.\n\nQ: So, why are you with a White man? Are you upset with Black men?\n\nA: Because he's good to me? And he has swag for days. Goodness is not binary, and Black men are still beautiful.\n\nQ: Black men ain't shit. I'm done.\n\nA: You's a damn, bitter fool.\n\nQ: Who is this n****, I mean, cracka on FB?! I see you in a picture with The Oppressor, so I'm curious.\n\nA: (Expletives)\n\nQ: You that type of Black that White men like! They don't want 'em yellow... they want 'em DAAAARRRRKKKK!\n\nA: Oh, really now? Thanks for the expertise.\n\nQ: You see, when White men date Black women, they're feeding an animalistic nature inside of themselves. It's carnal.\n\nA: Pull up, bruh. Pull up. Just, come back.\n\nQ: If you 'gon date a White man, make sure he has a trust fund.\n\nA: Wait, what? You date men in their 40s without checking accounts.\n\nQ: My husband doesn't like seeing White men with Black women, although he dated an Asian woman for a few years. You two should come over!\n\nA: Because we want to self-subject for experimentation?\n\nCultural and communal pressures guide standards for dating and mating, especially among American Black women. A 2015 report published by Brookings found that while American marriage rates are lower among black women compared to white women, black women are also the group that is least likely to \"marry out\" across race lines. Thus, an American Black woman who balks this trend and mates outside of her race will likely be subject to ridicule.\n\nI was struggling with opinions, which I now know to be cultural ignorance disguised as truth, bolstered by popularity. Remember when the Earth was flat?\n\nAs I detailed this new struggle with my Love, he offered this: \"If loving you gives other people the opportunity to grow, then I welcome it. And I'm excited.\"\n\n2015 was a violent year in America. My Facebook feed was inundated with daily injustice, and I honestly tried to log off. But then, there was a shooting in a Black church in South Carolina. And my president sang \"Amazing Grace.\" My feed was in a frenzy. One friend posted that she would never again sit with her back to a White man.\n\n\"This racial separation is what the enemy wants,\" I thought to myself. \"Why else would the media keep this rolling 24/7?\"\n\nThat week, Drew and I went to a Braves game, and had to walk through \"the hood\" at night to get back to my home. I was frightened and my senses were heightened, because I was a woman, who didn't look like the locals, walking through the hood near midnight with my full purse slung across my shoulder. And I was walking with a White man during one of the most racially tense weeks of the year. I felt like a mark.\n\n\"He held my hand to secure us, and I let his go to do the same. It broke his heart.\"\n\nDrew held my hand as we walked through the neighborhood, and he told stories to try and distract me from my panic. He confessed that he was not afraid -- be it his spiritual resolve or because he never had to learn the same fears as me growing up. I took off my precious gold ring and put it in my cheek. Fifty feet from home, we approached a group of locals under a streetlight and my fears got the best of me.\n\nI let go of his hand.\n\nBecause what if the sight of us together incited something that we couldn't be saved from? I felt like Mildred Loving. He held my hand to secure us, and I let his go to do the same. It broke his heart.\n\nThis seems to be a central lesson in our relationship -- how to love in hard places and to not let go when a good love is threatened by fear and anger (real or imagined) from the outside. To overcome the threat as one. And how could I not, when he loves me so damn... professionally?\n\nI have been mis-loved and mistreated in expert quantity. The parting gifts that I earned from mastering \"Good-Dick-and-Good-Convo-But-Conditional-Commitment 5201\" are outgrown, weathered, and trashed.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "I'm A Black Woman With A White Man. These Have Been The Hardest Weeks Of Our Relationship.\n\nGuest Writer\n\nGoing into any relationship as a biracial woman, I know one thing: Any serious relationship will involve discussion of the issues of racism .\n\nThat became even more crucial when I became serious with a white man. There were days I had lived as a Black woman that he would never live through or could imagine living through.\n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, there have been times when the undertones of racism have escaped him. Like that one restaurant where other couples without reservations got seated before us. Or when our former real estate agent told us to stay away from the neighborhoods we were interested in because they weren't filled with the \"safest people.\"\n\nNeither of those situations sounded any alarms for him. But as a person of color who grew up in neighborhoods such as the ones that agent deemed unsafe or who gets \"Pretty Woman\" syndrome in half of the restaurants she steps into, the alarms were deafening for me.\n\nStill, the door of understanding was never hard to crack open when a learning opportunity presented itself. No, it wasn't my responsibility to educate him on the Black experience. But he was a man who loved every person he met, who believed \"everyone should be equal,\" and yet couldn't understand how some people in this world didn't need a logical reason to be cruel. So I chose to enlighten him with stories, articles, speeches and podcasts.\n\nI guess I didn't completely understand the extent of this disconnect, or maybe I was unconsciously avoiding it. Maybe I didn't fully see how much he had to learn because he was so loving. Maybe ― deep down ― I was waiting to see how this relationship went and IF he was a white person I wanted to educate.\n\n\"What my partner said was covered in a blanket of blissful denial.\"\n\nBut with the emergence of protests after George Floyd was killed, I could feel the door I had worked so hard to keep open closing. The last few weeks, I've been falling Alice-style into rabbit hole after rabbit hole of bad news. The pain that consumed me this week left me feeling helpless and so overwhelmed.\n\nMeanwhile, he's been carrying on as if he's oblivious to the chaos and social unrest within the country. I know he checks his news app every morning. So why wasn't he falling with me?\n\nAnxiety crept in. I plan to marry this man. What would happen when we started building our family? I feared for the children we didn't have yet and the world they'd be living in. I considered the uncomfortable conversation about racism, bias and privilege every child of color sits through at some point and wondered if he would be supportive of it.\n\nHalfway through the longest week of my life, I started the conversation with my partner when we were in the car, just to see how he really felt about the civil rights movement happening 30 minutes from our home.\n\nHe told me that he understood the importance of protesting the death of this ONE man but that he didn't \"believe race played as much of a role\" in today's society as I thought and that it didn't determine someone's fate.\n\nDespite the monologue going on in my head and the weight I felt in my chest, I couldn't get my mouth to say anything other than \"OK.\"\n\nSeeing the hurt in my face, he prodded me for answers, genuinely confused about what he had said wrong. Regardless of how strong I believed our relationship was, his unwillingness to acknowledge how the issue of race could affect our future was damning.\n\nBeing apathetic and complacent is still a choice. The choice to remain silent is the choice to prevent growth from happening. Anti-racist activist Jane Elliot asked the white members of an audience to stand if they \"would be happy to be treated, as this society in general, treats our Black citizens,\" and wouldn't you know it: Not one person stood up. Like them, what my partner said was covered in a blanket of blissful denial.\n\n\"The truth of it is, whether he acknowledged it or not, our future was affected by the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\n\nHe failed to acknowledge how the issue of police brutality against the Black community started a social movement, and that this movement had the potential to change the way society looks at and treats Black lives, and how this movement included me ... and now him. He was looking at things with tunnel vision.\n\nThe truth of it is, whether he acknowledged it or not, our future was affected by the Black Lives Matter movement. To suggest otherwise meant one thing: His white privilege was showing.\n\nI needed him to be blazing this trail with me. When he didn't, I no longer felt comfortable with him, not from that moment. From the very first time he told me race didn't play as big of a role in our society as I thought, I began to shut down.\n\nBut even though I felt attacked and hurt, I never for a second believed him. I knew how big a role race plays in our society. It looks like walking into an Ulta Beauty shop after work and being followed by employees. Or like when I was working in a bakery and an older white man felt comfortable enough to tell me that the way I wore my hair scarf made me look like Aunt Jemima. Racism in America looks like people you don't know asking if your hair is real, and if it is, can they touch it, and if you say no, why can't they? And it looks much worse, as the events of the last few weeks have shown.\n\nSo I confronted him about his white privilege and explained it like this. The reason you feel so comfortable looking at racist actions through an objective, neutral lens is because you've never had to factor in the color of your skin when you've faced an obstacle. As a white man, there are nuances you've never had to think about, and it isn't because you don't care about others. It's because they have never affected you.\n\nWith sadness in his voice, he wrapped me in his arms and reassured me that he never meant to undermine my lived experience with racism. He admitted that he \"doesn't know what it feels like to be Black,\" and he didn't even consider having white privilege. This time, he was willing to acknowledge and validate my pain.\n\nThat talk was a tipping point for us. Before recent events, a small piece of me wasn't ready to confront him about his privilege or even acknowledge it, which is a privilege in itself, because we were able to mostly avoid the issue before now. Now that the real conversation has started, I feel lighter.\n\nThis is a very small beginning. We plan to continue having these uncomfortable conversations because we love each other and want to build a future together. Race is only part of who we are as individuals, regardless of how much it might influence our current circumstances. We're all human beings who deserve to be acknowledged, valued and respected.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Old White Men Syndrome\n\nI'm an artist who writes and blogs about things I have a passion for.\n\nI'd like to discuss a problem I feel we here in the USA seem to have that most other democracies do not. Old White Men Syndrome.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I love many 'old white men'. My husband is on that list. I suppose I should change it to read, Old White Republican Men Syndrome.\n\nMy husband and sons and male friends are more about equality than oppression of 'the weaker sex'. I'm not talking about niceties like opening a door for someone being a problem, that's simply good manners and if I'm at the door first I will hold it open for any man or woman.\n\nNo, what I'm talking about is the old white men who are stuck in the mid-century when 'the little woman' cleaned and cooked and took care of their men. My in-laws were the perfect example of that era. Dad was the bread winner and mom was the perfect house wife.\n\nI got married in 1968. The Viet Nam war was the lead story on the news every evening. I was grateful my husband had gotten a deferment for flat feet. We were very much against the war and got as involved as we could considering we were essentially children ourselves, starting our own family.\n\nI remember our POW bracelets being our way of showing our resistance. Then when the POW we were, in our minds, honoring came home he bashed all the protesters. Irony! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Kasler .\n\nMy husband and most of our contemporaries at the time were like minded in our protest of the war. It didn't sit well with some family members but, that didn't deter us.\n\nI'm not sure if the war had anything to do with the 'women's movement' at the time but, they were part and parcel in our home. Dave's brother-in-law, an Air Force officer, died in a plane crash in the war shortly before we were married. That didn't change my in-law's feelings about the war and didn't deter our protests of it.\n\nI think my point here is, the Viet Nam era became a defining factor for the men who embraced the '50's mentality and the men who supported women's liberation. My husband was the latter and I'm grateful for that.\n\nThe old white men who are currently running our country have never left the mid-century. The cabinet members 45 has placed are the best example of the regression we've seen since he became president.\n\nBut, here's what makes me hopeful in this crazy time. I'll let Rush Windbag tell you...\n\nOn his radio show yesterday, Rush Limbaugh launched a gendered attack against the three moderate senators who announced that they would not vote for full repeal of Obamacare: Susan Collins (Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). \"Now we find out the Republican caucus in the Senate is infected with essentially leftist members,\" Limbaugh said on his program, which attracts millions of listeners each afternoon. \"Collins, Murkowski, Capito - these three female leftists in the Republican caucus are running the Senate, not Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell is not running the Senate! These three women are running the Senate. The conservative Republicans in the Senate are not running the Senate. Three liberal women who call themselves Republicans are running the Senate!\"\n\nImagine his shock and awe! Three 'liberal' Republican women are running the Senate! I guess what makes them liberal, in his world, is having the gall to stand up to power and speak truth to it. Welcome to the 'Old White Man's Club' where having a shred of compassion makes you a liberal.\n\nWhat can we do about this? How can we, women and men of like mind, change this unbalanced slanted way of thinking?\n\nI say we start with term limits. My hope is the 2018 elections brings in fresh thinking moderates and liberals who will create balance by implementing term limits. Run on that platform, even.\n\nLet's face it...the members of congress who have been there most of their adult lives have lived in a bubble. They make laws that don't apply to them. You only have look at their wealth, as reported here by Time magazine, http://time.com/373/congress-is-now-mostly-a-millionaires-club/ , to see why they want to stay. They're not worried about health coverage!\n\nThen you get Rush Windbag attacking women legislators for trying to create a fair and balanced approach to health care. Isn't that his slogan, or is it Fox's slogan. Anyway, it's not what either of them believes.\n\nBut, here's what a bipartisan group of women legislators is currently working across the aisles to do:\n\nIn a rare moment of bipartisan agreement, Democratic and Republican lawmakers argued that too many women are being incarcerated for low-level offenses. Vanessa Williams reports : \"From Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.) to Republican Rep. Mia Love (Utah) and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R), there was bipartisan agreement that most of the women in jails and prison would be better served by drug rehabilitation and mental health services, rather than harsher sentences. They noted that most women in the criminal-justice system are victims of domestic abuse or sexual violence. And because most incarcerated women have small children, locking them away can destroy an already fragile family. The discussion came during a day long conference called 'Women Unshackled.'\"\n\nI don't know about you but, this makes me proud to be a woman. Proud that I, and my husband and many other upstanding men we know, agree that it's time for a fresh look through compassionate eyes.\n\nIt is time for the 'Old White Men' to step aside and let common sense and compassion for ALL American's to take over.\n\nNow it's your turn...tell me what you think.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Am I Finally Done With White Guys?\n\nWhether exploring understandably conflicted feelings about culottes or entrenched social issues like the wage gap, The Cut delves into a woman's world with intelligence, sophistication, and a dash of humor.\n\nBy Collier Meyerson\n\nWhenever I'm standing on a subway platform, I play this game: I hover near a person I think is cute and try to slowly make my way over to him so we get in the same car. When we do, I look his way every so often to see if he's staring back, to see if we've got what my best friend and I call \"the affinity,\" a mutual acknowledgement that we see one another. That maybe we like each other. I fantasize about our meet-cute. I wonder what it'd be like to talk to him. It's a pretty good way to pass the time from Brooklyn to midtown.\n\nRelated: 11 People in Interracial Relationships on the Intense Experience of Watching Get Out\n\nFor most of my adult life, I've dated white guys. I spent my childhood surrounded by black and brown kids, but when I got to high school, suddenly everyone around me was white. Like most of the girls in my class, I wanted attention from the boys. But while they chased after blondes and brunettes, I was ignored. And on those rare occasions a white boy kissed me in the copy-machine room at our high school, or when a white boy told me over the phone he had a crush on me, the acknowledgement made me feel chosen. It was addictive. The white boys I grew up with were cool: They rode their skateboards on private property. They smoked weed in their parents' houses with abandon. I envied and desired their freedom. If they wanted me, I thought, it was because I seemed free like them. Cool like them. At 18, I was fixated on being attractive to them. Since college I've had five boyfriends, and all of them have been white. And those affinity moments on the train? They're with white guys too.\n\nWhite men have preoccupied me my whole life, from the schoolyard to the subway, but these days I'm seeing them differently. They're no longer the object of my affection, a mirror for my self-worth, or an affirmation of my beauty. Right now, they seem altogether alien.\n\nThe night Trump was elected, I wrote about feeling lonely . I wanted to be comforted - but I wanted it to be by someone who had an inkling of the anxiety I felt for my family, my loved ones, and for myself. In the past, I'd have sought that comfort out in a white man, but that night I knew it wouldn't be enough. It's not that I don't think white people are anxious; two months into Trump's presidency, most of the white people in my life are activated. They're in the streets, calling senators and congressmen, attending community board meetings, and holding sign-making parties. I'm glad for it. But while the political universes of my white friends are cracking open, I'm feeling more inclined than ever to cloister myself.\n\nRelated: Why I Quit Online Dating\n\nI've gone on a few dates with white guys in the last few months, and the same thing always happens. During a bathroom break or a trip to the bar, I'll check my phone, and almost always there is a news alert telling me Donald Trump is attempting to curtail, or has just succeeded in curtailing, the rights of marginalized people in America. It's an odd thing to then go back to my date and continue the performance of \"getting to know you.\" I fantasize about walking up to him and saying, \"Gotta go!\" before heading for the door, but instead, I sit down, and continue talking about which dystopian novel best describes our current predicament, or whatever. Even if I did want to talk about how I feel, I'm not sure I'd be able to articulate it, especially to someone with such a different frame of reference from my own. In those moments, I've wished to be sitting in front of someone who could relate. Despite knowing I can feel intimacy with white guys, right now what divides us feels like a chasm.\n\nIn every relationship I have with a white man, there comes a moment when they come to understand a simple fact of my life: that racism is an intimate part of my daily existence. Sometimes, they're enraged - like the time when I called my last boyfriend after I left American Apparel in search of nipple covers for a white bodysuit. The store had some, but none that matched my skin tone. \"Are they fucking serious?\" he said in disbelief. And then there are the quieter times, the ones that weigh more heavily, that bring us closer together. Once, in my late 20s, my boyfriend and I were stopped by police, and I quickly became frantic about the weed in the car. He put his hand on my knee and reminded me that I was safe with him.\n\nBut, of course, for them it's just tourism. Racism isn't something white people need to face every day. And too many times, those same white boyfriends decided to sit out being my partner. I lost count of the times my boyfriend in my late 20s would tell me to \"just leave\" parties or social events when I complained of being the only person of color in his all-white friend group. Even more hurtful was the night he and I were standing outside a bar in Bushwick and someone we both knew started making racist comments. While I tried to explain to this man why what he was saying was offensive, my boyfriend stood there in silence. Later, I tried to convey how hurt I was that he didn't say anything, but he didn't seem to understand how bewildered I was. There are, in my relationships with white men, so many moments like that. No matter how close I held the mirror up to their faces, sometimes their good and liberal wells of understanding and compassion were simply inaccessible.\n\nRelated: Dating in New York Ruined Me for Paris\n\nOn election night, I thought about all those moments, and I felt overwhelmed at the possibility of taking that on over the next four years. Since Trump was elected, I've felt paradoxically alienated by white people finding or doubling down on their commitment to change. Somehow their politicization has begun to seem cartoonish, filled with performance and self-congratulation. It's not something I understand or feel a part of.\n\nBut it wasn't only on election night that translating experience felt so fraught. Communication is necessary for any healthy relationship, and in an interracial relationship it's paramount. Every white man I've dated has, sometimes consciously and sometimes not, asked me to explain to them some aspect of blackness. \"Can I say the N-word if I'm singing along to a song?\" \"How do I be a better gentrifier?\" (I don't know dude, I ask myself the same question every goddamn day.) I know that I shouldn't feel compelled to always speak for my race, but I can't expect a white boyfriend to stop asking some of those questions if we're to come to a mutual understanding. Lately, though, I just don't feel like answering them.\n\nThe other day, I was on the subway platform playing my usual game, and I caught the eye of a black guy. It felt different this time, like the flirtatious version of the \"black nod\" at work - an acknowledgement between two black employees who might not even know one another, but who have a shared experience.

      "text": "Responding To Racism As A White Man\n\nComedian. Author. Idiot.\n\nRobert E. Lee: Racist\n\nIn October 1980, I was 10 years old.\n\nI lived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and attended the now-shuttered 38th Street School. At that time, the slide from middle-class neighborhood to decrepit ghetto had just begun.\n\nI was a white face amid a sea of African-American students. I can recall one, two or three white companions, but most of my friends had a darker skin hue than mine. Which isn't to say I felt isolated or different; as a child, what you are surrounded with is \"normal.\" To me, having more black than white friends was what I knew.\n\nThere is one child whose name escapes me but whose face I can bring up any time I choose. One morning, we stood outside a classroom talking. Without warning, he whispered: \"Mamma says if Reagan gets elected, black people gonna be back in the cotton fields.\"\n\nI didn't really comprehend his words. They were inserted into our conversation out of the blue; we hadn't been talking about the election or politics at all for that matter. As a 10-year-old, what he said held no historical context for me. But I understood his wide eyes, the nervousness in his voice, and his hesitant body language. My friend was afraid. The way his mother said those words instilled a chill in his bones, which he transferred to me.\n\nMy friend walked off, leaving me to digest the sentence.\n\nWhy would Reagan send black people to a cotton field?\n\nWithin a couple of years, my family would move twice. While remaining in Wisconsin, we landed first in a small city and following that an even smaller town. The transition from big city urban to small town rural was informative; I learned more about bigotry than I ever wanted to know. Slurs were tossed around casually, with the worst of the worst punctuating the air anytime black people were mentioned.\n\nI was confused. I didn't know how to articulate my thoughts, but I knew that everyone in town was white and they seemed to hate a race of people they never interacted with. Given my background, I had no clue where the attitudes came from. I didn't know ignorance was handed down generation to generation. I didn't understand isolation or the fear of interaction. I definitely wasn't familiar with media manipulation and how it feeds fear and stokes flames.\n\nWhen confronted with racist attitudes, I remained silent. As a child, I wanted to fit in and be liked. I never joined in the hatred jubilee, I just bit my tongue.\n\nAs an adult, I am probably more outspoken and belligerent than I should be. That doesn't always win me fans.\n\nWith the debate over Confederate symbolism raging, the overwhelming consensus on my Facebook and Twitter feeds show support for the removal of statues and flags. Unfortunately, even the most open-and-shut cases of integrity will have detractors.\n\nOn Facebook, I saw a post by a white girl in her 20s. She lived in Ohio and was cute enough to have never had to self-examine or learn what white privilege is. Her words were a mix of vitriol and arrogance in defense of Confederate statues that ended with, \"If you support the removal of the flag, then tell me so I can unfriend you!\"\n\nI'm a stand-up comedian by trade; I knew this woman through touring, because it's my job to forever expand my base of contacts. Doing so helps me promote shows, sell merchandise and grow my brand.\n\nBut at what cost? This girl was someone I was supposed to be courting. When I'm in town I can post, \"Hey, bring all your friends to the comedy club this weekend!\" on her wall. As a child, I probably would have ignored her words. As an adult, I don't allow bullshit to go unchallenged.\n\nI frowned and then jotted down a quick, \"If supporting a symbol of racism is that important to you, feel free to delete me.\"\n\nLooking back, I probably should have just deleted her from my list. Wouldn't that have been the prudent action? Many things on Facebook (or any other form of social media) generally devolve into heated exchanges at best and all CAPS arguments at worst. Knowing that, why would I poke the bear that is Confederate ignorance?\n\nWithin minutes, her thread descended into chaos, anger and horrible grammar. People generally surround themselves with like-minded folk, which means when she was posting in favor of Confederate symbols, she knew her audience. Ignorance is a glue that binds people. The like-minded find one another and cling together using \"safety in numbers\" as a shield against outside influence; they circle wagons and latch arms.\n\nMy \"delete me\" response was ridiculed, and soon many of her friends were flying the flag of the Confederate bandwagon. All the usual terms were spewed forth: \"Heritage!\" \"Freedom!\" \"Censorship!\"\n\nI responded with the standard rejoinders: It's a symbol of racism, meant to signify the treasonous exit from the United States. It was founded solely on the idea of white supremacy. Censorship means mandated silence; the government isn't approaching private businesses and telling them to remove Confederate symbols.\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot argue logic against passion, and passion can bring out the worst in people. When you think you've seen the nastiest slander possible, they surprise you with just how rotten they are. I knew I was dealing with ugly, but even I was taken aback when I read her next words: \"Why can't they just get over it? They're not in the fields anymore!! Jews went through worse! Yet you don't hear Jewish people bring it up every single damn day they breath!\" (\"Breath\" being her choice of words, as opposed to \"breathe.\")\n\nI stared at the screen in furrowed-brow silence. Who would ever believe something so misguided, much less want to expose their spite to the world? How do you respond to great levels of clueless? It is near impossible.\n\nI could have explained that the \"cotton fields\" of today are impoverished schools and gerrymandered voting districts that deny representation, or that \"cotton fields\" is a metaphor for a justice system that incarcerates African-Americans at a disproportional rate than their white counterparts. Instead, I pointed out Jewish people aren't witness to Nazi flags flying everywhere, especially on government buildings. While I didn't want to speak for anyone Jewish, I do believe if she were to ask some Jewish people if they're over the Holocaust, her bubble might be popped.\n\nIn my frustration, I also I posted a popular meme insinuating those on the wrong side of the matter were stupid. To that, I was called a bevy of names.\n\nSo be it.\n\nI don't know how to challenge ignorance without resorting to brutal shaming. I do not know how to teach those who ostrich their heads in the ground and act like children with fingers in their ears shouting, \"La-la-la-la I am not listening to Jeffrey but he is still talking!\"\n\nIt is OK to defend beliefs. It is not OK to throw on blinders and ignore history.\n\nTrue to her word, she unfriended me on Facebook, and I was a mix of happy and sad.\n\nHappy, because someone like that is no longer even in the periphery of my life. To quote John McClane: \"I got enough friends.\"\n\nSad, because it means the woman is entrenching herself further in a mix of unawareness and willful stupidity. Sad, because these people will vote against their own economic interests simply because they have misguided beliefs instilled in them from their parents and support circles. Sad, because it shows that racial progress is made in millimeters, not leaps and bounds.\n\nIn 2017, symbols of racism and treason shouldn't be debated or voted on; they should be removed, destroyed, and remembered in the history books as a dark period of our history we are supposed to have moved beyond.\n\nThe last time I drove past the 38th Street School, in maybe 2008 or 2009, the building was boarded up and the neighborhood looked like a war zone. It was a bleak area of economic ruin with little hope of a better life for any child living within its radius.\n\nWhen I Google d my old stomping grounds before writing this piece, the listing came up \"Milwaukee College Preparatory School.\" The grounds are groomed, and it is offering the hope of education to residents attempting to break free the chains of poverty.\n\nHere's hoping every day is another millimeter away from those cotton fields.\n\nMore nonsense at www.nathantimmel.com .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "I Didn't Surrender My Asian-American Identity When I Married A White Man\n\nGuest Writer\n\nAn internet troll developed a particular infatuation with me a few years ago. His obsession wasn't so much with me as with what I'd \"done.\" I'd gone and married a white guy.\n\nTo him, this made me a race traitor. There was no way I could love my \"Asianness\" and also love my white husband. It wasn't a partnership, but a conflict in which I'd surrendered.\n\nIdentifying himself as half-Asian and half-white, he told me I was a \"whore\" to the white male patriarchy, and that my \"half-breed\" abomination children would loathe me for not keeping their Chinese bloodline pure.\n\nThe joke's on you internet troll ― my husband and I don't want kids!\n\nHere are the usual insults slung at Asian-American women who partner with white men: You have betrayed your race, you hate yourself, you hate your heritage, you are only interested in status, you're too old and ugly to get a good Asian man, you're a banana (yellow on the outside, white on the inside).\n\nWhat bothered me more than the fury of a man who needed help was the response that some folks gave me when I told them about my troll.\n\nA little while after he slunk back under his bridge, I was at a mixed gathering ― Chinese-American, Japanese-American, white, black ― gabbing with a group of people who I thought were of a like mind with me.\n\nI told them about my experience with the troll, expecting disgust, horrified disbelief, sympathy. And that's mostly what I got, except from one fellow.\n\n\"I'm sorry that happened to you,\" he said, then hesitated. \"That dude sounds terrible, but... can you kind of understand where he's coming from?\"\n\nAfter my initial surge of rage, I willed myself to speak evenly with this near-stranger, whom moments before I had deemed to be good company. Though he calmly spoke of cultural stereotypes, false equivalencies, and the racism visited upon Asian-American men and women since we first stepped foot in this country, his message was not new: To be an Asian woman in a relationship with a white man is not only taking an active part in the subjugation of Asian-American men by white culture, but it is also surrendering your voice in the fight for Asian-American equality.\n\nWhether you're an internet troll trying to bully me or a \"thoughtful\" guy at a party trying to mansplain your way into making me see reason, no, I do not agree with you. My status as an Asian-American woman is not enhanced or compromised by my marriage to a white guy.\n\nBut this is a controversy in the Asian-American community.\n\nThere is a belief, largely perpetuated by certain Asian-American men, that Asian-American women who date and marry white men are opportunists trying to elevate themselves in white culture ― a culture that historically tries to erase Asian-Americans, notably diminishing, \"emasculating\" and dehumanizing Asian-American men. (It does this to Asian-American women too, but the shock of dehumanizing women is still largely lost on American culture.)\n\nBehind this argument is the idea that Asian-American men are somehow owed the companionship of an Asian or Asian-American woman. That we ought to be with men of our own race if we truly feel Asian pride. How can we support Asian-American rights if we participate in white patriarchy through interracial marriage?\n\nBut this argument forgets: Nobody owes anybody marriage or partnership.\n\nYes, white culture has long fetishized Asian women, long held them up as exotic prizes to be won by white men. No Asian or Asian-American woman I've ever met is not aware of this. You develop finely tuned \"yellow fever\" radar as an Asian woman who interacts with non-Asian dudes.\n\nMen who rant that their \"Asian sisters\" shouldn't allow themselves to be \"prizes\" in white men's racist boner parties are assuming that, one, we have no choice in the matter and, two, we're nothing but objects.\n\nIf you're one of these men, isn't your anger over not being able to \"get\" an Asian-American woman also a form of objectification?\n\nWho do you think we are?\n\n\"There is a belief, largely perpetuated by certain Asian-American men, that Asian-American women who date and marry white men are opportunists trying to elevate themselves in white culture.\"\n\nBut what I find more insidious is the belief that an Asian-American woman cannot be a proper advocate for Asian-American rights if she has partnered with a white man. That it nullifies her advocacy and renders her a hypocrite.\n\nAsian-American women do not surrender their \"AZN Membership Card\" at the altar. I didn't. If anything, my marriage has made me double down, in no small part because of the people who question my Asianness.\n\nHaving an up-close perspective on how my husband and his family move through the world, versus how my family and I do, is eye-opening. I get a peek into the things they take for granted; the ease with which he and his brothers and sisters navigate most areas of American culture. And, yes, I am \"one of them,\" I get to go along for the ride. Sometimes I feel like a spy.\n\nBut seeing that side of America, one that isn't so accessible to people who look like me, who have my background, who sound like my parents, has lit even more of a fire under me to speak up about Asian-American equality. Perhaps in a way, being married to my white husband has afforded me a privilege that I didn't previously have, but having just a glimpse of that privilege has made me even more cognizant of racial inequality.\n\nAnd, frankly, I've influenced my husband to be more aware of how Asian-Americans are treated, how we are discriminated against. He cared before we got together, but I've made these issues a reality for him. It goes both ways.\n\nThe thing is, while Asian-American women bear the burden of culturally imposed expectations and prejudice, so do Asian-American men. Characterized in white American culture as nerdy, impotent and \"emasculated\" by binary standards, Asian-American men have had to work doubly hard to prove their worth as mates.\n\nIt is a stereotype that goes back over 100 years, to a culture that actually viewed Asian men as a threat to their white counterparts. The portrayal of Asian men as shifty and less than human, as sexless bachelors ― and in the case of Asian women, as \"whores\" to be bought by white men ― continues to be a part of the institutional racism contemporary America accepts.\n\nAnd with the rise of toxic masculinity, Asian-American men must exist in a culture that continually challenges them to prove that they are indeed \"men\" as defined by white standards. \"Hot Asian men\" are treated as the exception rather than the rule, whereas the stereotype for Asian-American women is sexy, uber-feminine and desirable. It's no wonder there is tension.\n\nAttractiveness is currency in America, and the stereotype that plagues Asian-American men often leaves them broke.\n\nIt's gross. It's unfair. In this way, I can completely understand why Asian-American men are angry. I'm angry too, for all the ways that we are portrayed.\n\nJust like with the model-minority myth ― a creation of white culture meant to keep Asian-Americans happy and well-behaved, and to promote in-fighting among Asians and with other minorities ― the controversy around Asian women partnering with white men serves a purpose: It keeps us divided.\n\n\"It's gross. It's unfair. In this way, I can completely understand why Asian-American men are angry. I'm angry too, for all the ways that we are portrayed.\"\n\nMaybe people within our own community perpetuate it, but the source of the turmoil comes from being reduced to stereotypes through a white cultural lens. Men are discredited because they are \"less than men\" and \"sore losers\" in the race to get an Asian female partner, and women are discredited because they are absorbed into their partner's whiteness.\n\nSo, no, internet trolls, I don't hate being Asian-American and I don't hate Asian-American men. I did not lose my identity or my beliefs when I married a white guy. My husband does not dictate my politics or worth.

      "text": "Humanity Has A Serious White Man Problem\n\nP.L. Thomas , professor of education (Furman University, Greenville, SC), is author of Beware the Roadbuilders and Trumplandia (Garn Press).\n\nHave you ever watched reality TV shows such as \" Hoarders \"? A disgusting but all-too-common urge to both glamorize and demonize, all in the name of entertainment and celebrity?\n\nHave you ever wondered why pop culture often turns our gaze on these people (or any group deemed profitable fodder for such filth)-and thus, turning our gaze away from other groups?\n\nThis didn't take much effort, but let me try my hand at a similar technique, although I am merely working here in words. Consider the following:\n\nFeel free to let me do the heavy lifting here, but also, I invite you to wade into the above for yourself: The thread running through these pieces gathered quickly and easily the day after Columbus Day is the violent, rapacious white man who hoards money and power at the expense of and on the backs of others and then uses that money and power too often to abuse and even kill those deemed weaker or lesser than these white men.\n\nThat we have failed to address the white man disease in humanity is not some great accident, however. Once with power, white men have carefully orchestrated how we view the world through keeping our gaze elsewhere, such as our manufactured fear of Muslim terrorists and centuries-long narratives of violent black men.\n\nThis slight of hand has mesmerized us into worshipping these horrible, often soulless men-Hugh Hefner, Christopher Columbus, Donald Trump -because of their bravado, wealth, and power.\n\nThe honoring of Christopher Columbus is grounded in more myth than fact.\n\nWhite men, often themselves mediocre , have parleyed their amassed wealth (typically begun in eras characterized by the very worst of human nature) into assuring that the general public has developed a skewed system for evaluating self-worth: white men are forgiven for any and every flaw because \"he built this,\" but everyone else cannot survive even one flaw, unless s/he is conveniently associated with the right white man.\n\nThe power of the arrogant white man is so intense, so capable of charming a people, that in the U.S. many excuse Trump minute-by-minute for the deplorable human he proves himself to be while following his pied piper lead to demonize Colin Kaepernick.\n\nAnd while the rise of Trump is one of the most disgusting and oft-repeated narratives of U.S. history, it is a slow-boil story, and we are the willing lobsters who gleefully offer ourselves up for the pot.\n\nMore catastrophic ― and all the more difficult to understand as unworthy of our attention ― is Stephen Paddock , murderous white man who is the most recent recipient of the inordinate passes white men receive: media headlines never offering his race and refusing to call him \"terrorist,\" family and friends shocked and confirming he was just your \"Average Joe,\" and the ultimate tone-deaf claim that there was simply nothing to tip us off about his reign of horror (because a certain kind of white man can walk through this world without any sort of scrutiny, even as he amasses an arsenal ― or systematically sexually abuses women).\n\nSo let's turn here to thinking carefully about this world built by white men, because the architects have ensured this world protects them and, as a consequence, works against everyone else.\n\nWhile these rapacious white men use \"I built this\" claim as their shield , we must recognize it as supreme distraction ; they are hiding something very insidious behind that shield, in fact. They are hiding their mediocrity, their soullessness, and their monstrosity .\n\nAs a white man, I speak from experience: the shield is powerful ― more powerful than we tend to admit.\n\nBut also as a white man who believes to my marrow in a better world where equity and justice are achieved for every human, I am left with a disturbing quandary.\n\nI have a fantasy that one day every worker in the service industry simply refuses to work; this act of resistance would highlight the inherent scam that is capitalism (the white man's paradise), the false narrative that the owners and bosses are worth more than the workers.\n\nThat fantasy has a new version ― one in which every black athlete in the NFL takes a knee and refuses to play a down of any NFL game so that the league and our so-called political leaders are forced to eat their words, called on their bluffs as the blowhard balloons they are.\n\nBut these fantasies are the musings of a white man who recognizes that it is not the responsibility of the oppressed to end such inequities. Yet, this system built by white men is a trap: workers are enslaved by hourly wages and tethered to work-bound insurance and retirement so that those workers have no real humanity left, no option to assert their dignity, their voices.\n\nThis is America: White heroes and their guns.\n\nEven very wealthy black NFL athletes who are taking ethical positions are being cast as bad guys ― a perverse rebooting of the white hat/black hat Hollywood whitewashing of cowboys and Indians :\n\nLike Baldwin, we need this moment of recognition ― that we have been duped, conned, hypnotized.\n\nIt no easy thing to admit that we are patsies, but we are being used.\n\nNow, there is no question about white men being outnumbered, but there remains a question about whether or not everyone else is really any better than these mediocre white men ruling us.\n\nThat question terrifies me nearly as much as all the Trump-hoarders ruling this world.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "How A 'White Man In My Pocket' Can Help You Understand Privilege\n\nArts and Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\n\"P rivilege is plastic,\" artist Kenya (Robinson) explained in an interview. \"Just like 'race' is a plastic material. It's totally made up. It's a story. It has no space in reality.\"\n\nKenya carries a white man in her pocket. Not a living, breathing human being, but a small figurine, something you'd pick up at a discount store. It was gifted to her by an old boss at the Brooklyn Children's Museum and it reminds her of a very important message: you are more privileged than you think, no matter your gender, socioeconomic status or the color of your skin.\n\n\"It was the first time I had a black woman as a boss,\" Kenya explained. \"After the day was done we would meet and debrief about what we were going to do next. Somehow the conversation veered -- she asked me if I had a boyfriend. And I was like, 'Noooo, but I want one!' And she said, 'You know what, Kenya? You need a white man.' I could tell she was leading somewhere. Then she says, 'I have a white man.'\"\n\n\"She pulls this sucker out, a figurine you could get from a discount school supply store. It comes in a set of six, I believe. He was this little businessman, still in the plastic. She said, 'You know what, I think you could use him.'\"\n\nThus the project # WHITEMANINMYPOCKET was born.\n\nFor Kenya, the unorthodox exchange between coworkers happened at the most fortuitous of times. \"There was all this bullshit happening with white people apologizing for things they had said. Steve Martin had tweeted something offensive and Paula Dean made her comment . I thought, you know what? You've been getting so out of pocket I'm going to put you in my pocket. And I took him out of the wrapper and I put him in my pocket. And that's what started it.\"\n\nThe artist imagined that the male figurine clad in business casual could serve a variety of purposes. For one, the miniature flips is capable of flipping any power dynamic, theoretically restoring a sense of agency to those silenced and stymied by patriarchy and prejudice. But the stoic little men, first and foremost, serve as a reminder of the illusory makeup of privilege -- an invisible commodity available to those who step up and own it.\n\n\"As someone who strongly identifies as a black, American person, all of the violence inflicted upon black bodies -- verbally, emotionally, physically, spiritually -- it's really overwhelming. I needed something. I needed to create privilege for myself because every message that I was receiving told me I wasn't privileged at all. But, you know what? I am breathing. I am able to express myself in a positive way. That is a big privilege, but sometimes I forget that.\"\n\nWhen Kenya began the project, her white man lived publicly online -- primarily on Instagram -- through a thorough photography archive that documented its daily goings on. She soon noticed that strangers who caught a glimpse of the #WHITEMANINMYPOCKET often reacted viscerally and conspicuously. \"There's this Chinese bakery that I've been going to for years,\" said Kenya. \"One day, I'm looking for change and I pull out my white man and put him on the counter. Normally this place is all business, but the woman at the counter, she just started laughing out loud. I then realized this thing had power.\"\n\nSo Kenya decided to extend her project beyond Instagram, making a tiny army of pocket-sized white men. Her first idea, inspired by the Terra Cotta soldiers in China, was to construct a multitude of ceramic figurines and then bury them. She then changed gears a bit, opting instead to create her diminutive crowd from chalk -- a material she likes for being \"really white white\" in hue. For an upcoming June exhibition (location to be announced), she plans to make thousands of them.\n\n\"I've been wanting to really expand the sense of scale,\" Kenya explained. \"I am not going to make what I call a ' big dick ' sculpture. But I can make so many multiples that it feels overwhelming in the space.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Kenya hopes that even saying the words \"white man in my pocket\" in anticipation of the exhibition will mobilize others to strive for change, and own their inner privilege. \"Black people often times whisper the word white. It's like, if you can't say the word then what hope do you have of changing the conversation? You have none. I wanted to create something where, at least, people will practice saying 'White man'... We're not talking about race. We're talking about the relationship between black people and white people. And when we use words that are confusing, it's blocking the real conversation.\"\n\nThe miniature figurines, she believes, can serve as visible, tangible reminders of that abstract idea of privilege, a word that's commonly used but perhaps not too often understood. \"You already have more privilege than you think you have,\" she said. \"Privilege is plastic material anyway; it's just a made up thing. If you say it enough, people will agree.\"\n\nStay tuned for more on Kenya's project. In the meantime, you can check out the history of #WHITEMANINMYPOCKET on Instagram here ."

And I'm peach.\"\n\nI don't remember saying anything back, but I think in my mind I was like \"Okay. . . ? Well these Legos aren't going to build themselves.\"\n\nMatt was trying to do me a favor. He was trying to introduce me to the very bizarre and peculiar rules that we all know as grownups - very important things to understand. If you didn't understand them, you'd find American life and society very strange. You'd do things you shouldn't do, go places you shouldn't go. You'd mess up if you didn't understand the particular rules that govern the ideology of race in the United States.\n\nSometimes when you go outside of the American context you begin to appreciate how particular and unique these rules are. I remember reading about a (probably apocryphal) interview with the former dictator of Haiti, Papa Doc Duvalier , who referred to the \"white majority population\" of Haiti. The American journalist interviewing him didn't understand, so they had to define to each other what makes somebody white or black. The American journalist explained that in the US, one metaphorical drop of black blood designates someone as black. And Duvalier replied, \"Well, that's our definition of white.\"\n\nThe whole idea of this talk - if you take away nothing else - is this: the whole thing is made up. That's it. And you can make it up different ways; and people have and do. And it changes. And it has nothing to do with biology or genetics. There's a study of several decades of census records that found that twice as many people who call themselves white have recent African ancestry as people who call themselves black.\n\nThis is not just a matter of folksy beliefs, or prejudice, or wrong ideas, though those things are all in the mix. This is a matter of law.\n\nThe Naturalization Act of 1790 determined who got to call themselves an American citizen. It restricted citizenship to persons who resided in the United States for two years, who could establish their good character in court, and who were white. To jump ahead, the Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896 reaffirmed the legitimacy of having separate railroad cars for black people and white people.\n\nOne thing we often forget about that case is that Homer Plessy's argument was that he was white! He got bounced from the white section because the conductor said he was black. The question wasn't that all train passengers should be able to sit together, rather Plessy said, \"No, I'm a white person, actually.\" The court admitted that it was very important to be able to determine who was white and who was not, and that having the ability to be white is a form of property, that it's valuable, extremely valuable, in 1896.\n\nThe court said in its decision that \"if he be a white man, and be assigned to the color coach, he may have his action for damages from the company, for being deprived of his so-called property. If he be a colored man and be so assigned, he has been deprived of no property, since he is not lawfully entitled to the reputation of being a white man.\"\n\nPeople sued over this. Native Americans and others were going to the courts and, saying \"no, I won't be treated as I'm being treated\" and demanding the property interest in the reputation of being a white person. So in 1921 the powers-that-be decided they needed a definition of a white person.\n\nHere's what they came up with :\n\nA White person has been held to include an Armenian born in Asiatic Turkey, a person of but one-sixteenth Indian blood, and a Syrian, but not to include Afghans, American Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, Hawaiians, Hindus, Japanese, Koreans, negroes; nor does white person include a person having one fourth of African blood, a person in whom Malay blood predominates, a person whose father was a German and whose mother was a Japanese, a person whose father was a white Canadian and whose mother was an Indian woman, or a person whose mother was a Chinese and whose father was the son of a Portuguese father and a Chinese mother.\n\nYou know . . . white people!\n\nSo when I say it's all made up, I mean it. It's made up.\n\nBut that's not to say it's not real. It's very real. It's real in the same way that Wednesday is real. But it's also made up in the same way that Wednesday is made up.\n\nHuman beings that look the way we do evolved around two hundred thousand years ago in the African continent and began leaving it around seventy-five to fifty thousand years ago. They settled in various parts of the globe and in bands of people that were, for the most part, cut off from each other.\n\nAnd as all travel was by foot, they stayed in the same place for many thousands of years. And by staying in the same place for many thousands of years, these groups actually did evolve to look differently from each other, for reasons that have to do with the various environments in which they found themselves.\n\nSo there is a biological basis to the reason people look differently from each other. And if you look at those people before the modern era of tremendous transportation, of people going all over the place for political reasons, of people being carved up geographically into nations - all things that are pretty much brand new in human history - the people that settled around the band of the equator, where they get the most intense direct sunlight, all over the earth, those people have darker complexions. Now why is that?\n\nAll human beings, regardless of their complexion, have the ability to produce melanin as a protection from UV radiation. If you are fair skinned and subject to intense direct sunlight for prolonged periods you are likely to develop skin cancer. Skin cancer might not stop you from reproducing (and therefore passing on your genetic material) because in general you're going to develop that when you're older.\n\nBut there is evidence that UV radiation interrupts processes associated with folic acid (folate) which can cause birth defects and other problems. So people with darker complexions of course absorb UV radiation, but they are protected not only from skin cancers but also from related interruptions to reproduction.\n\nBut if you're one of those people who has been living for thousands of years in regions far from the equator, regions of scarce or indirect sunlight, you have a different problem - the problem of Vitamin D deficiency. The sun is a crucial source of Vitamin D for humans, so you're going to have illnesses associated with Vitamin D deficiency. You actually need to absorb more sunlight, and so paler skin is advantageous in those places.\n\nThis is really the only biological basis we can find between people who have different complexions around the world, but that's a far different thing from saying that people with different complexions actually comprise races of people in a biological sense.\n\nThis is important because scientists have certainly tried for a long time to prove that there are different races, and it's all been disproven. It's bunk. Today we even understand that there is more genetic diversity within the so-called races than between them.\n\nThe anthropologist Carol Mukhopadhyay writes about how things that we think of as demonstrating a biological basis of \"race\" are just not true: \"In the United States, the sickle cell gene is more common among African Americans than other populations - but it is not a 'racial' gene. The genetic variation that causes it is also found in parts of South Asia, southern Europe, and the Middle East. And it is found in only some areas in Africa.\"\n\nShe also writes about genetic diversity among what we call \"black\" people:\n\nWhen we turn to the racial category 'Black', we find enormous geographic and human variability - Africa has deserts, mountains, oceans, tropical areas, and spans a range of latitudes, some distant from the equator. It has hundreds, if not thousands, of linguistically, culturally, politically, and historically distinct populations. Africa is home to the shortest and the tallest people of the world. Other traits vary significantly, including skin color, facial traits (nose, eye shape), overall body shapes, even the frequency of sickle cell and lactose intolerance.\n\nThe problem with Americans' folksy way of defining who's who based on skin color, is that skin color is not a discrete trait. There's a spectrum, a gradation, of skin colors, and so marking off at an arbitrary point at which to say somebody paler than this is one thing and somebody darker is another is not a naturally occurring division between people.\n\nThere are a few traits that are like that, actually - discrete traits where you either have one thing or the other. Earwax is one of those things, there's only two types; you either have sticky or wet. But we're not likely to see a sticky-earwax civil rights movement anytime soon. Or a Wet Earwax Party for Self Defense.\n\nHere's a thumbnail sketch of the history of the invention of \"race.\" Race is a new development. If human history were a two hundred page book, \"race\" begins on the last line of the last sentence of the last page. And it starts here, in the United States.\n\nHistorians look at the Virginia colonies as the origins of what we call race. At the beginning of the 1620s, European settlers discovered that mining, pillaging, and looking for gold were unsustainable get-rich-quick schemes; instead, they could get rich by growing tobacco. And as historian Barbara Fields says, nobody ever got rich growing tobacco by democratic means. The most profitable things to do is to press people into the growing of it.\n\nFirst the European colonists tried to press native people into this labor, but that failed - the native people were on their home turf, they knew the land better, and they could escape. Native Americans were not a reliable source of the kind of intense labor power the Virginia colonists needed. And these Virginia settlers were not producing the tobacco to smoke it, but rather for someone to smoke it that they'd never see. This is production for a world market, at the pace of the world market, for unseen tobacco consumers thousands of miles away. So this is the origin of alienated commodity production on a mass scale.\n\nThe settlers also tried to press fellow Englishmen into this labor, creating indentured servitude, sometimes even kidnapping people. And of course indentured servants were essentially property: they could be bought and sold, traded, they could be put up for stakes in card games, they could be whipped or even murdered.\n\nBut this system too had problems and limitations, mostly because the labor supply is drawn from the home country; if you drag indentured workers all the way down to the condition of abject slavery, you ratchet up the class struggle at home. The other problem is that it's a temporary servitude and if they survived (they didn't always), formerly indentured laborers become landowners and therefore competitors to their former owners.\n\nSo the settlers finally hit upon the idea of kidnapping people from Africa and bringing them to Virginia. But that was not systematic at first, and because it wasn't systematic there was no coherent set of ideas about those Africans.\n\nAfricans existed in many different conditions in the colonies. Some Africans were free; there are even instances of Africans bringing lawsuits against Europeans - then called \"Christians\" - and winning. There are records of Africans adopting Christian babies. It's only later that language changes from \"free\" and \"slave\" (or \"African\" and \"Christian\") to \"white\" and \"black.\" Africans were available for enslavement in ways that other people were not.\n\nFor the first time in human history, the color of one's skin had a political significance. It never had a political significance before. Now there was a reason to assign a political significance to dark skin - it's an ingenious way to brand someone as a slave. It's a brand that they can never wash off, that they can never erase, that they can never run away from. There's no way out. That's the ingeniousness of using skin color as a mark of degradation, as a mark of slavery.\n\nBut it's not until you have systematic African slavery, until the cost of an African slave dips below the cost of an indentured servant, that you get the rush of African kidnappings and the development of mass African enslavement and the ideas to justify it.\n\nThere are some crucial turning points in this history, such as Bacon's Rebellion in 1676. Bacon's Rebellion was a massive insurrectionary rebellion of slaves and indentured servants; in 1676 they deposed the governor of Virginia, burned down plantations, and, several hundred strong, defended themselves against the planter militias for several months. It marks an important turning point because it represents what we would now call \"white\" and \"black\" people banding together against the planters.\n\nOf course, it's crucial to understand this is not an uncomplicated history. This was not a socialist revolution - one of the insurgents' principal grievances was that the governor wasn't killing Indians and clearing land fast enough! But the fact that the planters faced a united opposition from laboring people shows that the ideology of race was not natural or automatic.\n\nAfter suppressing the rebellion, the planters moved more decisively to put divisions into law and to categorize people. So white people were then allowed to own property, own guns, participate in juries, serve on militias, and do all kinds of things that were to be forever off-limits to black people. It's important to understand that black people were not systematically barred from these things before.\n\nWhile this color line was being drawn very decisively in the United States - and I should point out, for a very practical reason, because it made it easier for the planter elite to divide and control both camps - the color line was being drawn differently in other places that used African slaves. This occurred for a simple reason - in other slave societies, specifically in the Caribbean, there were not enough \"white\" people to govern the black slaves.\n\nPlanters had to recruit from among the Africans to help govern them, and so they had to draw the color line in a different way. And so while the ideas of full-blown white supremacy and African inferiority came to be the general ideas of the North American slave context, they have different variations in different places because of the different outcomes of the political situation.\n\nBarbara Fields argues that the American Revolution was another crucial turning point in this development because it's the first time in human history that a nation declared that all people are equal. Before 1776, inequality was not something that nations decried; no other nation ever stated that all people are equal. America wore that badge on its chest. But of course they had the rattling of chains right there behind them while they were writing the document.\n\nFields argues that when self-evident laws of nature guarantee freedom, then only equally self-evident laws of nature can account for its denial. Hence the intensity of the ideology of white supremacy in the founding of the United States, the need for a scientific, biological explanation for why these Africans are inferior.\n\nWhat I've presented here is just a thumbnail sketch of the history of how white supremacy came to be. There are some other important things to read and discuss; I want to name a few.\n\nRead, for example, Ta-Nehisi Coates' piece in the Atlantic - he goes through Jim Crow, housing segregation, all of the ways that people have been legally robbed in this country. Also Michelle Alexander's argument in The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness is very compelling. She argues that today, without using the language of \"white\" and \"black,\" there's a new system of trapping people with felony convictions, which disenfranchise black people on a mass scale.\n\nIn their book Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life , Barbara and Karen Fields raise some really provocative arguments that I think are important for us to grapple with. One is the idea that people often use the term \"race\" when what they really want to talk about is racism. When commentators emphasize \"race consciousness\" or \"race relations,\" they make something that's about oppression into something about identity.\n\nA classic example is the tragically common refrain, \"They shot him because he's black.\" We all know what that means, but actually, the sentence doesn't make sense. Black skin doesn't attract bullets. The color of someone's skin does not cause them to be shot. That's oppression that causes that to happen. That's racism, not race.\n\nBarbara and Karen Fields use the term \"racecraft,\" evoking witchcraft, to describe an ideological fog, a pervasive mental terrain, in which all of this operates. One of their most provocative arguments is that well-meaning people often end up recreating the ideas of race in their attempts to be anti-racist. For example, by trying to find in ideas of race something to do with culture, or something to do with identity. But Barbara and Karen Fields point to the example of Amadou Diallo , an immigrant from West Africa who was gunned down by New York City police in 1999.\n\nIf the police had known that he was an African immigrant, and not an African-American, would they have thought he was the same kind of threat?\n\nAmadou Diallo didn't get to define himself in America. They define you. Black is something imposed on you in this country. It's not a self-definition. Look at all those court cases of people trying to define themselves and being told, \"No, you're not that.\" Native American tribes have gone before United States courts for generations, explaining that they define tribal membership socially (that is, as people who live on tribal sites and perform tribal practices), not genealogically. But time and time again, the court insists that bloodline is what matters.\n\nIt's hard to say that race is identity when it's something they put on you. And many, like Amadou Diallo, are subject to this preemptory imposition of racial identity in highly deadly ways.\n\nThis talk has focused on people of African descent in the United States. But once it became the dominant idea in the US, racism proved to be a highly useful ideology. Racism allows you to carve up the entire world into so-called races.\n\nAnd then it becomes available as an ideological framework to explain and justify wars, and to explain and justify the subjugation of all kinds of people - so-called immigrants from Mexico, for example - or to describe what the United States continues to do to its native population. And all of those racisms have particular features, dynamics, and politics that are unique to those struggles and to those contexts. It's a highly malleable set of ideas.\n\nI want to end with a discussion of how to best confront racism today. I think fighting racism in our context has certain unique challenges. One of the challenges is that we are living on the heels on a tremendous antiracist struggle - the Civil Rights and Black Power movements - and now nearly every institution in our society swears up and down that it doesn't discriminate.\n\nThe official stance of every institution is antiracist and in favor of \"diversity\" and so on. But we know at the same time that all of these institutions - every university, every school, every prison - has a tremendous pattern of racial disparities: who gets punished and who gets rewarded, who gets opportunities and who doesn't. These tremendous patterns happen at the same time as a high level of official denial. And the court has ruled again and again that the pattern isn't enough, you have to show intent to demonstrate racism.\n\nSo there's a kind of obsessive hunt for individual intent in racism. I recall journalists pouring over 911 transcripts after the murder of Trayvon Martin , trying to determine if George Zimmerman did in fact say \"nigger\" before he gunned down the black seventeen-year-old on the sidewalk close to his home. But it doesn't matter what came out of his mouth. It matters what came out of his gun!\n\nRacism is most obvious when people are dumb enough to voice it aloud. Like that rancher and basketball team owner - if they slip up and say something racist then there's a big hoopla. But the day in and day out racist degradation and denial of opportunities are ignored.\n\nThere's another challenge. The whole history is elites using racism to divide and control the working population. Now there's a new twist in which they use a kind of fake anti-racism to divide and control us. I'm thinking of the recent struggles in education, where they use a fake anti-racism to divide parents, teachers, and students; like the recent lawsuit against teacher tenure, which they wrap up in the ropes of Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Movement. So that presents a challenge for us.\n\nOne item of continuity between these different eras is pervasive attempt to pathologize people of African descent. Even Barack Obama has frequently played into this by talking about the parenting practices of black parents; the very fact he can do that shows the pervasiveness of the idea - it's become common sense that there is something pathologically wrong with the culture of black people in this country.\n\nContrast that with what happens when people of a different complexion shoot up a school (nearly every week in this country, it seems). Obama wouldn't get on TV and say, \"Tsk, tsk . . . white parents - c'mon white parents!\" Obama would never do that because our society does not say that there's something pathologically wrong with white people in the same way.\n\nMany African-Americans thinkers and left-wing intellectuals are actively engaged in thinking through how to deal with this. And there's some debate - for example about affirmative action.\n\nOn the one hand you have people like Cheryl Harris. In an article called \" The Property Interest in Whiteness ,\" Harris describes some of the things I mentioned about the ways in which the courts have upheld whiteness as an identity that is worth something - it has real material value. And she argues that affirmative action undermines that property interest in whiteness by giving certain advantages to people of color.\n\nCoates argues something similar, that the question of reparations is important, and affirmative action is a part of that, and he says we have to be honest - giving a slot at a university to a black kid means that we are therefore not giving something to a white kid, and that's okay because we've been not giving something to black kids for a long time - so how can you cry foul now?\n\nAnd then on the other side you have people like Michelle Alexander - read all the way to the end of her book - who has a very different argument about affirmative action. And by the way, I don't think her argument is aimed at the Left as much as it's aimed at the liberal legal and civil rights establishment; they've been focused on affirmative action and diversity, she argues, while mass incarceration has unfolded under their noses. She makes an interesting observation: \"Whereas black success stories undermined the logic of Jim Crow, they actually reinforce the system of mass incarceration.\"\n\nThink about that for a minute. Because under the old Jim Crow, the idea was that black people couldn't do anything; if you were black, you couldn't be a doctor, couldn't be a lawyer, and certainly couldn't be president. And so we cheered for every black doctor or black lawyer, because that challenged the logic of the old Jim Crow.\n\nBut the ideology of the new Jim Crow, is to pump up the few black success stories in order to denigrate everybody else, in order to further pathologize black people, as if to say, \"If you're not the president, then what the eff is wrong with you?\" And so she argues that affirmative action (\"now we're admitting 8 black people to Harvard . . . see?\") is part of the structure of blame for everybody else. And that's important.\n\nSimilarly, the Fields sisters argue that there's a way in which this line of defense for affirmative action recreates race; it substitutes diversity efforts for genuine justice and short-circuits, they argue, a real conversation about inequality in general.\n\nThey ask, \"Why are we saying it's okay to just insert a few more black people into that college,\" for instance, by which we sidestep the conversation about why college isn't available to all. That assumes that there's scarcity of college, or of jobs - that that shortage is a natural state of affairs - and leaves us with no language to talk about inequality in general.\n\nNow the caveat to all this is that the few Neanderthals who did survive from fifty thousand years ago are all on the Supreme Court. Their attack on affirmative action from the Right has nothing in common with these critiques from the Left. And we're in a context in which those real gains (meager as they may be) are under constant attack from the Right. They're under attack from those who use the logic of colorblindness to say, if you're not succeeding, what's wrong with you? That kind of colorblindness is instrumental to the new racism.\n\nI won't pronounce a winner in this debate, but it seems to me we can take a stance that is not either-or but both-and. We want to fight for anything that is reparations-like in a way that does not assume the scarcity of opportunity to be natural, but rather calls it out as historical and artificial scarcity.\n\nThere's got to be a way to fight for specific reparations while also aiming our arrows at the fundamental inequality that underlies all of American life. And I think that is the spirit the socialist movement should take from here.

But we do have to set our sights much higher - on dismantling the institutions that entrench racial inequality and violence.\n\nAnti-racism protesters attend a Black Lives Matter demonstration on June 13, 2020 in London, England. Luke Dray / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn towns and cities across every state in the nation, protests have erupted in bitterness and rage. In the year 2020 - decades after the civil rights movement and black urban uprisings of the 1960s, and six years after the explosion of the Black Lives Matter movement - the sober reality is that black lives in America still do not matter in the face of daily injustice and police terror.\n\nRacist attitudes, from the most embarrassing to the most pernicious , help reinforce white supremacy on a day-to-day basis. If state institutions - from violent police forces to segregated, unequal education to fatally disparate health care - form the bars that hold black America in second-class citizenship, the ideology of racism is the diet of the prison guards. For every Amy Cooper who calls the cops on a black man, knowing full well the potential consequences of such a call, to every white doctor who disbelieves a person of color when they arrive at the hospital, the repercussions of racist ideas are undeniably real.\n\nIt is therefore useful for people, especially white people, to examine their ingrained assumptions and implicit biases. Living in a racist society means absorbing bigoted ideas - they are the air we breathe. Humility and a sense of how much we have to learn is therefore warranted.\n\nAt the same time, the (often well-intentioned) rush these days among white progressives to soul-search and \"check their privilege\" risks allowing guilt to guide actions, causing them to stay on the sidelines , \"mute themselves,\" or retreat into internal reflection instead of building solidarity and joining the struggle.\n\nWhite people \"stepping up\" to \" take responsibility \" for their privilege won't get us very far. But forging real solidarity through concrete campaigns, protests, and movements can. There are a couple of reasons why.\n\nFirst, our struggles are structural, and they are interconnected . We live in a society that quickly marshaled thousands of troops, dozens of curfews, and countless police armed to the teeth in response to protests, but that left hospitals without enough ventilators and PPE to deal with a deadly pandemic. We live in a society with devastating levels of homelessness, on the precipice of a potential wave of evictions, but that would rather spend money to arrest and brutalize people than provide decent housing.\n\nThe movement on the streets is insisting that we defund the police and redirect those resources to hospitals, schools, and public housing, recognizing that racial injustice and the economic strangulation of black America cannot be separated from our corroded public budgets and decrepit social welfare state. If we are going to root out racism, we need collective, mass action that can push for far-reaching material solutions and change the very political economy of the United States.\n\nThink about two potential courses of action. A young white man, appalled by the racism of American policing, could spend his time stewing over the instances he allowed his unconscious biases to inform the way he spoke to a classmate or the advantages he received when applying for a loan. He could stop there. Or he could actively support the movement pushing for transformative change by organizing his neighbors and coworkers to join protests , mobilizing with his union to get police out of schools , or joining a local campaign to defund the police in his city.\n\nWhich line of action will have a chance of attacking segregation and the unconscionable lack of investment in black neighborhoods? Which will have a chance of breaking the ties between police departments and schools and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline? Which will have a chance of funding the public hospitals and personnel that could address the deadly racial disparity in COVID-19 deaths and ensure everyone gets the care they need?\n\nThe obstacles to winning these kinds of far-reaching reforms are immense.\n\nBut if the struggle for racial justice is going to avoid being isolated and quelled, multiracial solidarity is essential. The movement will need a base that is wide enough and deep enough to force concessions from an entrenched power structure that benefits from the status quo.\n\nThat solidarity is not only necessary, it has a material basis. While white people clearly do not suffer under the boot of racism, poor, working-class, and even middle-class white people have much to gain from the fight for racial justice: one of the primary reasons the United States has such a lackluster welfare state and weak labor movement is that racism has been used to divide people and obscure their shared interest in challenging corporate and ruling elites.\n\nThis leads, secondly, to the question of the relationship between structural change and racist ideas. The social and institutional foundations of racism cannot be dismantled one person at a time through the lens of our psychologies. Systemic and deep, social changes require mass action and political organizing.\n\nIt could be useful or satisfying to argue with your racist uncle and try to persuade him to gradually shift his worldview. But sea changes in public consciousness - the kind of sea change that has led hundreds of thousands to pour onto the street despite the twin dangers of a pandemic and a police riot, millions more to identify with protesters, and triggered major cracks within the ruling elite - are ultimately a product of mass movements. Black Lives Matter has done more to transform public consciousness than anything since the upheavals of the 1960s.\n\nOf course, we're still left with a sizable swath of hardened bigots and racists. But these people are less likely to shift their views from private conversations, and more likely to reconsider due to the combined impact of the wide ideological reach of a mass movement; legislative action that makes concrete changes to desegregate neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals; and real economic progress, which would deliver a living wage, free higher education, and an adequately funded national health care system to improve the lives of working people and undermine racial disparities.\n\nThere is a rich tradition in the United States of multiracial organizing , and of white people putting their bodies on the line in solidarity with people of color to fight racism. To win substantive change, we don't have to disavow one-on-one conversations or personal education. But we do have to set our sights much higher, on dismantling the institutions that entrench racial inequality and violence. That requires getting involved in political struggle, not just looking inward.\n\nHadas Thier is an activist and socialist in New York, and the author of the forthcoming book A People's Guide to Capitalism: An Introduction to Marxist Economics .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Philip Randolph, the influential twentieth-century labor and civil rights leader, would no doubt have mixed feelings about the state of labor in the United States today. On the one hand, union density has declined precipitously over the last half-century, from roughly one-third to one-tenth of all workers. On the other hand, there's been an upsurge of union organizing in recent years, particularly among black and brown workers.\n\nAs the leader of the first successful black labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters , Randolph was committed to organizing black workers, particularly at a time when many unions excluded African Americans. By the 1960s, most unions had welcomed black workers into their ranks, although it took a few more decades for these workers to rise into positions of union leadership. Today, black workers have the highest unionization rates - 12.8 percent, compared with 11.2 percent for white workers, 10 percent for Latino workers, and 9.2 percent for Asian-American workers.\n\nA new report shows that the number of American workers represented by a union increased by two hundred thousand, to a total of more than sixteen million, between 2021 and 2022. The entire increase was among workers of color. No, that's not an exaggeration. The number of black workers represented by a union increased by 142,000, Latino workers by 101,000, and Asian-American workers by 64,000. Meanwhile, the number of unionized white workers declined by 31,000.\n\nBecause nonunion jobs grew at a faster rate than union jobs, however, the share of workers represented by a union declined from 11.6 percent in 2021 to 11.3 percent in 2022 - continuing a decades-long trend of declining union density. Whatever the gains among black and brown workers, Randolph would be dismayed by this development, believing as he did that a strong multiracial labor movement was a bulwark of democracy, a protector of human rights, and an antidote to racism. As he wrote in a March 1919 editorial in his radical magazine the Messenger :\n\nThe history of the labor movement in America proves that the employing classes recognize no race lines. They will exploit a white man as readily as a black man. They will exploit any race or class in order to make profits. The combination of black and white workers will be a powerful lesson to the capitalists of the solidarity of labor.\n\nIt was this advocacy of a multiracial labor movement united against the elite few that made Randolph the \"most dangerous Negro in America,\" and which necessitates preserving his legacy today.\n\nSchools in New York City, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Jacksonville, Florida are named in Randolph's honor, but it is unlikely that their students know much, if anything, about him. Nor is it likely that people walking through A. Philip Randolph Square in Harlem or A. Philip Randolph Heritage Park in Jacksonville, or people passing by the five-foot bronze statue of Randolph at Boston's Back Bay train station or the statue of him in the concourse of Union Station in Washington, DC, could identify who he was or what he accomplished.\n\nThat's unfortunate, because Randolph was an inspiring presence throughout the twentieth century. He built bridges between black and white workers, and between the labor and civil rights movements. He recognized that unions played a key role in channeling white workers' frustrations and anger toward corporate America rather than scapegoating black workers - a much-needed lesson in this age of Trump-ignited racism among many white Americans.\n\nThe son of an ordained minister and a seamstress , Randolph grew up in Jacksonville. An outstanding student, he attended the Cookman Institute, the only academic high school in Florida for African Americans. There he excelled in literature, drama, and public speaking; starred on the baseball team; sang solos with its choir; and was valedictorian of his graduating class of 1907.\n\nIn 1911 Randolph moved to Harlem, the cultural, political, and economic capital of black America. He worked menial jobs while taking night courses in English literature and sociology at City College and participating in the radical intellectual and political ferment of the times. He was drawn to socialism and to acting. He helped organize Harlem's Shakespearean Society and played the roles of Hamlet, Othello, and Romeo. He gave up his ambition to become a professional actor, but he fused his talents for acting and organizing by becoming a socialist soapbox orator on the streets of Harlem.\n\nHe met Chandler Owen, a law student at Columbia University, and they formed a number of short-lived political, community, and labor groups. One was the Brotherhood of Labor, an employment agency in Harlem, which they hoped would catalyze union organizing among black workers, but it went nowhere.\n\nIn 1917 Randolph and Chandler started the Messenger , which they called \"the only magazine of scientific radicalism in the world published by Negroes.\" The monthly publication mixed politics and culture. It promoted the Harlem Renaissance, crusaded against lynching and US involvement in World War I, and encouraged black Americans to join unions and embrace socialism.\n\nAlso in 1917 Randolph organized a union of elevator operators and two years later became president of the National Brotherhood of Workers of America, which organized black shipyard workers in Virginia. But in 1921, the white-dominated American Federation of Labor (AFL) undermined Randolph's efforts and the union fell apart.\n\nRandolph criticized the prominent black intellectual-activist W. E. B. Du Bois's focus on organizing the \"talented tenth\" of African Americans rather than building a mass movement that included black workers and farmers. Randolph's efforts to that movement were not restricted to unions; he was also active in the Socialist Party and even ran for office. Randolph led the Harlem wing of Morris Hillquit's 1917 Socialist campaign for New York City mayor. Three years later, the Socialist Party nominated Randolph himself for New York State Comptroller. He didn't win, but he garnered 202,361 votes - only one thousand less than Eugene Debs , the party's presidential candidate.\n\nThrough his magazine, speeches, and political campaigns, Randolph made a name for himself. But not all who knew of his activism were fans: in 1919, A. Mitchell Palmer, President Woodrow Wilson's attorney general who was responsible for the anti-socialist Palmer Raids during the First Red Scare , labeled Randolph the \"most dangerous Negro in America.\" In the heat of World War I, Palmer had Randolph arrested for treason for his antiwar views; he spent two days in jail but was not prosecuted.\n\nAt the time, Randolph had done little to earn Palmer's label, but that would change.\n\nIn 1925 a group of black porters for the Pullman Company came to Randolph for help organizing for better wages and working conditions. The company hired black men as porters - waiters and luggage handlers - on its sleeping cars, a form of luxury travel. At its peak, the Pullman Company was the largest single employer of black men in the United States, employing twelve thousand.\n\nBeing a Pullman porter was among the best-paid jobs available to black men, and as a bonus it offered the opportunity to travel around the country. But working conditions were onerous. Porters worked as many as eighty to one hundred hours a week. They were not paid for overnight layovers and were excluded from the better jobs, such as conductor, which were reserved for whites. They relied on tips for most of their income, which meant they had to endure the racist insults and rudeness of white passengers, including the indignity of being called \"George\" (the name of the company founder George Pullman) rather than by their own names.\n\nThe company was politically well connected, as Eugene Debs had learned the hard way in 1894, when he led a strike of railway workers that was crushed by federal and state troops. Soon after Randolph and others announced the formation of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the company fired union members, threatened workers with tougher or fewer assignments if they showed any pro-union sentiments, and branded Randolph as a Bolshevik.\n\nRandolph worked tirelessly to organize workers and combat the company's union busting, traveling across the country, meeting with porters, and trying to keep the organization together with limited funds and outside support. The Messenger became the union's official publication, but Randolph also generated publicity for the union in black newspapers and in some radical publications. Randolph became the public face of the organization, drawing on a core of activist porters as his key organizers, as depicted in the 2002 film, \" 10,000 Men Named George ,\" starring Andre Braugher as Randolph.\n\nThe porters admired Randolph's hard work and integrity, but for almost ten years the BSCP had little to show for Randolph's efforts. The New Deal changed the odds. Amendments to the Railway Labor Act in 1934 gave railroad workers the right to unionize. The next year, Randolph persuaded a vast majority of porters to endorse the BSCP as their collective voice in negotiations with Pullman. That year, the AFL voted to grant an international charter to the BSCP. After two more years of difficult negotiations, the Pullman Company finally signed a contract with the BSCP in1937, a major milestone.\n\nRandolph's goal was not simply to build a union of porters but, rather, to promote the idea of trade unionism to skeptical black workers. He also sought to persuade the white labor leadership that black workers deserved their support and should be part of union drives in every industry in which they toiled. Randolph later recalled:\n\nThere was no other group of Negroes in America who constituted the key to unlocking the door of a nationwide struggle for Negro rights as the porters. Without the porters I couldn't have carried on the fight for fair employment, or the fight against discrimination in the armed forces.\n\nRandolph's national stature as a black leader was further enhanced in 1936 when he was drafted to serve as president of a new organization, the National Negro Congress (NNC), made up of about two hundred black groups. Its goal was to build a mass movement of blacks, mostly by working through labor unions but also by promoting civil rights.\n\nSeveral key Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) unions backed the new organization, and the NNC provided support for several union campaigns, encouraging black workers to join the industrial union movement. But Randolph soon realized that many of NNC's key union supporters were Communists who expected the NNC to support Communist Party positions on foreign policy matters - including unquestioning support of the Soviet Union, of which Randolph was critical. Randolph had been outmaneuvered. In 1940 Randolph resigned from the NNC but kept his position with the BSCP.\n\nBy then Randolph was an important figure in the black community. Still a socialist, still dedicated to the labor movement, and still a crusader for civil rights, Randolph embarked on what some friends told him was an impossible task: to get the president to end racial discrimination in the defense industry and desegregate the US military.\n\nThe boom in defense spending in anticipation of US entry into World War II created good jobs for white workers but not for blacks. In 1940, only 240 out of 107,000 workers in the aircraft industry were black. Even where they were hired, they were consigned to the worst jobs.\n\nSimilarly, there were only 4,700 blacks among the US Army's half a million soldiers. Only one of the Army's four Negro units was being trained for combat. There were no blacks in the US Marines, the Tank Corps, the Signal Corps, or the Army Air Corps. Blacks were often trained in segregated camps and were almost always assigned support duties - digging ditches, building roads, cooking and serving meals. Even the Red Cross blood supply was segregated.\n\nAfter hearing Randolph speak about these issues, Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for Randolph, Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League to meet with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on September 27, 1940. Roosevelt listened but did not make any promises. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox argued that white sailors would never accept blacks as equals on the same ship. Roosevelt's chief military and cabinet advisers opposed integration.\n\nAngered by Roosevelt's indifference, Randolph formulated a plan and came up with a slogan: \"We loyal Negro Americans demand the right to work and fight for our country.\" He set up a National March on Washington Committee. He enlisted the NAACP, the Urban League, the porters, and black newspapers to spread the word. They set a date for the march: July 1, 1941.\n\nRoosevelt was informed about the proposed march but refused to schedule another meeting with Randolph to discuss it. Randolph kept the heat on, writing Roosevelt letters demanding a meeting. At that point, Roosevelt asked Eleanor to contact her friend Randolph and ask him to cancel the march. Randolph refused, and Roosevelt eventually agreed to another meeting.\n\nOn June 18, 1941, Randolph and White sat down with Roosevelt at the White House. They reminded the president that the nation was gearing up for World War II, but that African Americans were consistently being excluded from well-paying jobs with private defense contractors. The two civil rights leaders wanted the commander in chief to open up defense employment to blacks. If not, the march was on. Randolph looked Roosevelt in the eye and told him, \"Time is running out. We want something concrete, something tangible, positive and affirmative.\"\n\n\"How many people do you plan to bring?\" Roosevelt asked him. \"One hundred thousand, Mr. President,\" Randolph responded. This figure staggered and frightened the president. Roosevelt then turned to White. \"Walter, how many people will really march?\" Roosevelt asked. \"One hundred thousand, Mr. President,\" White said without hesitation.\n\nRoosevelt relented. A week later, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, which Randolph had helped draft. It stated, \"There shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.\" The order also created a Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to investigate reports of discrimination. Randolph called off the march. The headline in the New York Times on June 26, 1941 read: \"President Orders An Even Break for Minorities in Defense Jobs.\"\n\nRandolph may have been bluffing. Could he have pulled off the threatened march of one hundred thousand African Americans? It's not certain, but if anyone in America could have, it would have been Randolph, and that is what Roosevelt feared. At the time, Randolph was the most effective African-American organizer in the country. He was a powerful voice for civil rights and had important allies among liberals, progressives, and radicals.\n\nThe FEPC did not live up to Randolph's expectations. Discrimination in wages and seniority persisted in the defense industry. The armed services remained segregated. As blacks migrated to northern cities to take the worst jobs in the defense plants, they encountered racism from whites at work and in the housing market. Nevertheless, weak though it was, the FEPC marked the beginning of federal efforts to end racial discrimination in employment. Future efforts would build on this foundation.\n\nAlthough Roosevelt had promised much more than he delivered, Randolph - and the American left - had learned valuable lessons about power and about organizing. Whether or not he was bluffing, Randolph faced down the president with the threat of mass movement, and Roosevelt reluctantly agreed to Randolph's demands.\n\nIn 1948 Randolph not only again threatened mass protest if President Harry S. Truman failed to order an end to segregation in the military, but this time he also urged black men to resist the draft until the president relented. He led pickets at that year's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to embarrass Truman. Truman was furious, but that July he signed an executive order to integrate the armed forces and federal civil service jobs.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, '50s and '60s, Randolph kept pushing on both the labor and civil rights fronts. He traveled around the country, speaking at college campuses, union halls, churches, and street meetings, building support for a society that could provide decent jobs and equal treatment for all Americans.\n\nHis protégés played key roles in challenging America's economic class and racial caste system. In 1941, Randolph hired twenty-nine-year-old Bayard Rustin to lead the youth wing of the March on Washington movement. Rustin was disappointed when Randolph called off the threatened march, concerned that it would take years for Roosevelt's order to be enforced. But working with Randolph, Rustin learned tools that he would employ for the next three decades as a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr and an influential advocate of nonviolent civil disobedience.\n\nIn 1945, Randolph spoke at Morehouse College, where King was a freshman. Randolph predicted that the near future would witness a global struggle that would end white supremacy and capitalism. He urged the students to link up with \"the people in the shacks and the hovels,\" who, although \"poor in property,\" were \"rich in spirit.\" It was an eye-opening moment for the sixteen-year old King.\n\nIn 1955, after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to move to the black section of a segregated bus in Montgomery, one of Randolph's protégés - E. D. Nixon, a leader of the BSCP, the head of the Alabama NAACP, and the president of the Montgomery Voters League - became the key behind-the-scenes organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott. Parks had worked as Nixon's assistant in the local NAACP office and was well known and respected in the black community, which made her arrest the perfect catalyst for the boycott. Nixon recruited the twenty-six-year-old King - then a newly arrived minister in town - to become the boycott's public face.\n\nThat year, Randolph became a vice president of the AFL-CIO's Executive Council, and in 1959 he helped found the Negro American Labor Council. For the next several years, he endeavored to foster the burgeoning civil rights movement and link it with the labor movement.\n\nIn 1963 the movement was gathering momentum, but the various civil rights organizations competed for attention and funding. Randolph pulled them together - along with the leaders of major labor, liberal, and religious organizations - and laid out his idea for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The march would push for federal legislation, including an increase in the minimum wage and the Civil Rights Act, which President John F. Kennedy had proposed but which was stalled in Congress. Kennedy tried to dissuade the leaders from sponsoring the march, contending that it would undermine support for the legislation. But Randolph had faced down presidents before, and he did so again.\n\nRandolph hired Rustin to serve as the march's day-to-day organizer. Some civil rights leaders objected because Rustin was gay, fearing that his involvement would discredit the civil rights movement, but Randolph would not back down, insisting that it had to be Rustin. Thus appointed, Rustin pulled together a staff and organized all the logistics.\n\nThe August 28, 1963 march attracted over 250,000 participants - the largest protest march in American history at the time. The march is best known as the setting of King's \" I Have a Dream \" speech, but it was Randolph who gave the first oration at the Lincoln Memorial that included this message:\n\nLet the nation and the world know the meaning of our numbers. We are not a pressure group, we are not an organization or a group of organizations, we are not a mob. We are the advanced guard of a massive, moral revolution for jobs and freedom. . . .\n\nBut this civil rights revolution is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they cannot be free while we are not. And we know that we have no future in a society in which six million black and white people are unemployed and millions more live in poverty. . . .\n\nWe want a free, democratic society dedicated to the political, economic and social advancement of man along moral lines. . . . We know that real freedom will require many changes in the nation's political and social philosophies and institutions. For one thing we must destroy the notion that Mrs. Murphy's property rights include the right to humiliate me because of the color of my skin. The sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality. . . .\n\nThe plain and simple fact is that until we went into the streets the federal government was indifferent to our demands. It was not until the streets and jails of Birmingham were filled that Congress began to think about civil rights legislation. It was not until thousands demonstrated in the South that lunch counters and other public accommodations were integrated.\n\nA photograph of Randolph and Rustin at the Lincoln Memorial graced the cover of LIFE magazine's September 6, 1963 issue.\n\nThe march - along with ongoing organizing efforts in Southern cities - paved the way for passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the first major civil rights legislation bill since the Reconstruction era. That year, President Lyndon Johnson awarded Randolph the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his activist career.\n\nBut that didn't stop Randolph from criticizing Johnson. In the late 1960s, as Johnson's Great Society anti-poverty programs stalled because of the rising cost of the Vietnam War, Randolph led a coalition of progressives to propose a Freedom Budget for the nation, calling for spending $185 billion ($1.6 trillion in today's dollars) over ten years to fight poverty.\n\nThe proposal was cowritten with Rustin, with the forward written by King. In a clear testament to Randolph's ideological influence, King wrote:\n\nWe shall eliminate slums for Negroes when we destroy ghettos and build new cities for all. We shall eliminate unemployment for Negroes when we demand full and fair employment for all. We shall produce an educated and skilled Negro mass when we achieve a twentieth century education system for all.\n\nRandolph retired in 1968 and lived quietly in New York City. His health deteriorated, and he died at the age of 90 in 1979.\n\nRandolph never gave up his socialist belief that unions and their members, regardless of race, are key to the struggle to redistribute society's wealth, provide good jobs for all, and create a more democratic society. And he persisted in his belief that strategic mass action by a coalition of liberal, progressive, and radical forces is central to making America live up to its ideals.\n\nThe millions of people who benefit today from his contributions to the civil rights and labor movements should know his name.\n\nPeter Dreier teaches political science at Occidental College.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAn hour north of New York City just past the Hudson Line's Peekskill station, a golf course sprawls along ponds, sand dunes, and weeping willows. Before this idyllic green was carved from the wooded valley, my friends and I knew it as the defunct Hollowbrook Drive-In. With a giant L-shaped mid-century sign fading above an entrance on the far edge of a traffic circle, I recall during my middle and high school years the skunk weeds and dandelions breaking through asphalt that sprawled beneath a long-neglected screen. I pictured old films playing in black and white. But four decades before, the world-beloved actor, singer, activist, and lawyer Paul Robeson produced a concert here. What that concert spurred made our town infamous, associated forever with the phrase \"Peekskill riots.\"\n\nIt was late August when Robeson arrived. The concert was a fundraiser for the Civil Rights Congress, one of the many progressive organizations that fell victim to a right-liberal backlash against the social and economic policies of the Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) era. The start of the Cold War gave succor to conservatives eager to put brakes on a civil rights movement, whose most forceful advocates were radicals and socialists.\n\nThe day of the riots, Robeson and his entourage saw a burning cross on the hill above; racists pelted and flipped over some of the singer and his crew's cars; rioters effectively blocked the concert to supporters; and mobs slinging racial epithets against blacks, leftists, and Jews injured a dozen. A week and a day later, the concert proceeded. But damage was done: the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) gloated and plastered Peekskill with posters adorned with phrases lifted from fascist rioters during Kristallnacht.\n\nThinking back on my childhood, I found it strange how little I knew about these events. We never heard about Robeson in our history or social studies courses. A cultural amnesia had overcome our town, broken only by a small group of people who were able to draw a connection between the horrors of the past and the right-wing revanchism of the present. I wondered, too, whether something like this cultural amnesia was at play on a national scale. Did it explain how a country which had driven itself into a frenzy during McCarthyism could rally around a new red scare under the guise of anxieties over anti-leftist conspiracies, like \"Critical Race Theory\"?\n\nPaul Robeson was the son of William Drew Robeson, a runaway slave turned Presbyterian minister, who had fled from his captors to Princeton, New Jersey, in 1860 at the age of fifteen. From there he met Robeson's mother, Maria Louisa Bustil, a schoolteacher and member of a family of prominent anti-slavery and Jim Crow campaigners.\n\nOn Sundays, he would watch his father's weekly sermons boil over into operatic morality tales on the importance of race pride. The younger Robeson's own membership in this educated African American milieu allowed him to gain access to the more liberal parts of society. Although he would in his later years describe Princeton as still \"spiritually located in Dixie,\" it would provide Paul a starting point from which he would be admitted to Rutgers University on a full scholarship. At the respected institution, Robeson would go on to be the star of the university's glee club and an all-American for football.\n\nFrom New Jersey, Robeson would move to Harlem and apply to study at Columbia Law School before landing a job at Stotesbury and Associates, a prestigious Manhattan law firm. But here he hit a wall in the halfway world in which he was attempting to make a life for himself. A racist secretary informed Robeson's colleagues that she would not take dictation from a black man and the partner who hired him as a favor to a mutual friend warned that clients would not let Robeson represent them in court. Robeson took the hint and tried his luck on the stage.\n\nIn 1923, Robeson earned the lead in Eugene O'Neill's All God's Chillun Got Wings , one of his first major roles. The play depicted an interracial relationship between a white woman and her black husband, whose success she resents so deeply that it leads her to sabotage his budding law career. The resonances with themes in Robeson's own life must have been clear to him.\n\nControversially, the script called for the lead to kiss his costar, Mary Blair, the wife of the literary critic Edmund Wilson. Delays in the production caused by an illness which afflicted Blair during rehearsals led to an unusually long buildup which provided the media with an opportunity to work the public into a frenzy. Weeks before the play was due to air, the New York American published an article with the headline \"Riots Feared From Drama,\" and the Long Island chapter of the KKK threatened to blow up the theater.\n\nAlthough Robeson's director, Eugene O'Neill, and all of his costars came to his defense, dismissing the supposed controversy as not worthy of remark, reactionaries rallied around it. On opening night, steelworkers close to the cast guarded the dressing rooms from possible attacks as police fenced the theater in response to the numerous threats. Fortunately, these attacks did not materialize and although critics were generally not very enthused by the play, they praised Robeson's contribution. One went so far as to write that \"Caucasian superiority does suffer a little, because Paul Robeson is a far finer actor than any white member of the cast.\"\n\nThe Robesons would move to London in 1928 where Paul would star in a production of Show Boat , a West End musical adapted from a best-selling book about race relations in the American South. The appearance of Robeson was the talk of the town. On one occasion he was denied entry to the Savoy Grill, a fancy London eatery, and this incident became national news and was discussed in the Houses of Parliament.\n\nEven within the cosmopolitan world of the arts, Robeson felt that he struggled to reconcile his ideals with films in which he was cast. In 1934, the Hungarian-British filmmaker Zoltán Korda asked him to star in Sanders of the River , alongside Kenya's future president, the conservative leader Jomo Kenyatta. The film, which depicted British colonialism, was initially thought by Robeson to offer a harsh criticism of the institution. Black nationalists like Marcus Garvey would later ridicule Robeson for acting in what turned out to be another white man's burden narrative. Reflecting on these events, Robeson would describe the film as something that could have been \"shown in Italy and Germany, for it shows the Negro as Fascist States desire him - savage and childish.\"\n\nRobeson eventually landed a handful of films on the working-class struggle, stories more in line with his politics. In Song of Freedom (1936), he played a dockworker whose singing voice makes him famous, and whose fame allows him to investigate his regal bloodline in Africa. In Jericho (1937), he plays a heroic World War II officer who refuses an order to abandon ship to save the lives of his men. Robeson would truly hit his stride with a film on the plight of Welsh coal workers.\n\nThe relationship with these miners began a decade earlier, when Robeson emerged from a matinee performance of Show Boat back in London. He was confronted by a chanting crowd of Welsh miners, who had marched all the way from the neighboring country. They were on strike, blackballed, and going hungry. After taking them to eat, hearing of their union activity and their difficult position, with no other jobs in their region, Robeson took up their cause.\n\nHe visited Wales and brought their story to the screen in the musical The Proud Valley (1940), in which he plays a sympathetic American named Goliath. Without prospects in America, Goliath works in the Welsh mines, and ultimately, saves his comrades from a tunnel collapse. Historian Tony Benn recalls of the musical, \"It was through his contact with the Welsh miners that he realized he was working class, as well as black.\"\n\nIn 1934, during the Great Depression, Robeson first visited the Soviet Union on the invitation of the Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein. The auteur had hoped to direct Black Majesty , a film on the Haitian Revolution starring Robeson as the island's liberator, Toussaint Louverture. Though the partnership never panned out, his journey to the Soviet Union made clear to him the contrast between fascism and socialism. Going through Nazi Germany, state officials harassed Robeson for traveling with a white woman. \"I could read hatred in their eyes,\" Robeson thought while reflecting on this episode. \"This is how lynch mobs start.\"\n\nRobeson viewed international socialism as a great equalizer and the only real solution to fascism, and Robeson was impressed by a film shoot on a collective farm, which Eisenstein showed him. The constitution of the Soviet Union guaranteed in Article 123 full equality for all. Within the workers' state, Robeson could remark, \"Here, I walk in full human dignity.\"\n\nIn 1936, with a fascist coup overturning the elected left-wing government of Spain, Robeson made the consequential decision to deepen his commitment; he would relegate his career to second place, behind the anti-fascist struggle. \"I stand before you in unalterable support of the government of Spain, freely chosen by its sons and daughters,\" he told European audiences. \"The battlefield is everywhere. The artist must take sides. He must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice.\" Crisscrossing Spain, he sang to wounded soldiers and demoralized partisans in hospitals or depots on their way to the front. Singing in English, Spanish, and Russian, he aimed to bring hope to the leftist Republican forces.\n\nAs a greater European war loomed, Robeson and family prepared to return to the United States. But after spending so much time abroad, his reputation had dimmed in his homeland. At the height of the jingoistic fervor generated by the war, Robeson took on a patriotic musical produced by CBS, titled Ballad for Americans . The show was hackneyed and uninteresting: war propaganda set to soaring music mashed up with a 1940s History for Dummies libretto. It ended up being a wildly popular radio special that made the singer more famous in the United States than ever, and quite likely the most famous black man in the world. Riding on this high, he would go on to take the lead role in the longest running Broadway production of Othello .\n\nPreempting the rise of Joseph McCarthy and the House and Senate Un-American Activities Committees, President Harry Truman presided over a purging from government posts of progressives whose views he thought might make them sympathetic to Russia. It was in this tense atmosphere that Robeson would help found the American Crusade Against Lynching (ACAL) in 1946 and bring its concerns to a rally in Washington on September 23, followed by a meeting with Truman. The president would respond to the ACAL by dismissing its concerns; now was not the time for bringing up such divisive issues.\n\nTruman insisted that the United States and Great Britain represented \"the last refuge of freedom in the world.\" The historian Martin Duberman recounts in his biography of Robeson that the civil rights icon scoffed at this, referring to rampant imperialism from both, and went on to add that \"if the federal government refused to defend its black citizens against murder, blacks would have to defend themselves.\" At which point, \"Truman declared the interview at an end.\"\n\nTruman had only added support to a broader backlash against the progressive politics of the FDR era, and now Robeson was in its sights, called for the first of many times before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), likely as a result of the Truman meeting. In 1951, the State Department planted an article in the NAACP's The Crisis magazine, chiding him as a dupe of communists, who was dangerously \"naïve.\" The following year it suspended his passport. The aim of these smear campaigns was to drive a wedge between the Left and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAs the smear campaign intensified, and concerts were canceled under the blacklisting regime - which targeted university professors, Hollywood progressives, musicians, athletes, writers - Robeson and his pianist and musical partner Larry Brown had to leave America to earn a living. In Paris, Robeson shared a stage with Spanish painter Pablo Picasso and Chilean poet Pablo Neruda at the Partisans for Peace Congress in 1949. There he issued an anti-war statement and warned of the horrific consequences of a conflict with the Soviet Union. He contrasted the valor that African Americans displayed on the front to the poor treatment they had received at home. The media misreported Robeson's statement, playing up the suggestion of black revolt and disloyalty to the nation.\n\nAt first oblivious to the reaction back home, Robeson continued his tour, proceeding to Eastern Europe, and arriving in Moscow in June 1949. Hoping to find out if the rumors of antisemitic repression in the Soviet Union were correct, Robeson asked to see his friend, the poet Itzik Feffer, who was then locked incommunicado in Moscow's Lubyanka prison. Six years prior, Robeson had met with Feffer in New York at a meeting of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee along with Albert Einstein.\n\nThe actor waited for several days to see his friend who was finally brought by state officials to see Robeson in a hotel. There, Feffer signaled that the room was bugged and the duo spoke cautiously while passing notes.\n\nWhere have you been ? Robeson jotted.\n\nPrison .\n\nWhat can I do ?\n\nSay nothing or we prisoners are dead.\n\nBut Robeson followed the visit with a concert in Tchaikovsky Concert Hall. It was broadcast live, with Soviet leadership in attendance. Though no recordings survive, Robeson announced - \"to gasps,\" according to his son - that he saw his friend Itzik Feffer earlier.\n\nWith little fanfare, after reminding the audience of the long-standing cultural ties between Jews in the United States and those in the Soviet Union, then asking for silence, Robeson sang an encore of the Warsaw ghetto resistance song, \"Zog Nit Keynmol,\" offering an extraordinary moment of defiance to Stalin. When Robeson came home, rather than offer a header to the American right, however, he said nothing.\n\nIn America, Robeson found himself in a bind. He opposed Stalinist terror, but he did not wish to give support to a cold war that many feared would grow to a direct war between two rising nuclear superpowers. Unable to find a solution to this dilemma, he opted simply to lie. When asked directly by a small newspaper about Stalin's atrocities toward Jews, he denied knowledge of purges that Feffer and other friends in Russia underwent. In 1952, Feffer along with twelve other Soviet Jews would be executed in Lubyanka prison in Moscow.\n\nBut more than his silence on these purges, it was his antiwar message in Paris that haunted Robeson's return to the United States. Aware that the Truman moment was defined by a reactionary media, which performed like an adjunct to the security state, he watched as his plea for peace and freedom from fear was twisted into an expression of disloyalty. The HUAC reactionaries and centrist splitters even pulled baseball great Jackie Robinson into the debate. Robinson was allegedly strong-armed into testifying against Robeson, convinced that he wouldn't have a career if he objected.\n\nWhen Robeson arrived in Peekskill in 1949, this climate of anti-communism and red-baiting served as the backdrop for his performance.\n\nAs he drove toward the field with his sixty-five-year-old mother, folk singer Pete Seeger rolled down his window, and told the cop he had to get through; he was here to sing. There wasn't going to be a concert, the cop said, and gruffly turned away. Helen Rosen picked up her friend, Robeson, the star attraction, at the Peekskill train station. He had called ahead and told her he'd been warned of disruptions.\n\nAs they approached the field known then as Lakeland Acres picnic area, Rosen recalled seeing unusual traffic, hearing noises and disturbance, even screaming. A gang of veterans broke through the barricades and its members proceeded to vandalize the stage. Seeger recalled seeing piles of stones beside the road on the way in, with rocks as large as tennis balls piled several feet high.\n\nThe piles must have been covered when performers came in, Seeger told an interviewer. Otherwise, he would have seen them. Rioters turned cars on their sides, smashed windshields, and injured dozens. Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and Catholic organizations had rallied the opposition in the Peekskill Evening Star . Knowing Robeson's three prior concerts here had been successes, these groups pitted Peekskill's traditional working-class inhabitants against a relatively new enclave of wealthy, educated, left-wing weekenders, many of them Jewish, like Rosen.\n\nIn the aftermath, with the announced do-over concert to come a week later, signs appeared across the town that read, \"Wake up, America. Peekskill did.\" Supporters of the violence had plastered these posters on store windows and car bumpers, recalled Seeger.\n\n\"In Europe, they were horrified,\" Seeger told the interviewer. \"They said those were the same signs that went up in Germany after Kristallnacht. Only in Germany they read: 'Wake up Germany: Munich did.' . . . As pogroms grew, they whispered, 'Throw stones at all the Jewish storekeepers,'\" he recalled.\n\nAt the second concert, twenty thousand supporters arrived to hear Robeson, Seeger, and others, who were met by eight thousand protesters. Like two decades earlier in Provincetown, Robeson's people organized trade unionists to link themselves, arm in arm, around the stage, forming themselves into a human wall. Though the one-day concert was finally able to go forward, again the protesters shouted violent antisemitic and racist threats, chanting, \"We'll kill you,\" and \"You may get in but you won't get out.\"\n\nThe volunteer security, made up of union members, flushed snipers from the trees above the field who were alleged to have high-powered rifles and their sights ready to aim at the stage. But after performers left under close protection, with only a verbal barrage of violence able to reach them, a mass beating followed. A barrage of stones and blows rained down on the union members and other left-wing supporters of Robeson, who were corralled in the field that became the drive-in I knew growing up, and later the golf course it remains today. Until 1:30 AM, the police oversaw this beating, resulting in one hundred fifty injured, and did nothing to stop it.\n\nIn the days that followed, reactionaries launched a witch hunt against the Left and a nasty combination of racism and anti-communism came to dominate the town. Fascists plastered posters which read \"Communism is Treason, Behind Communism stands - the Jew!\" on cars. In the neighboring village of Harmon, one of the few Jewish homes had its windows smashed and the American Legion requested that books written by known communists be removed from Peekskill's library.\n\nFaced with a backlash which had at this point become national in scale, Robeson did not back down. In a press conference held after the grand jury hearing into the riots, he said before an audience of reporters that \"the Communist Party has played a magnificent role in fighting for the freedom of the American Negro.\" Despite the vitriol thrown at him by the Right, he would continue to defend freedom of speech and association as central to any progressive politics, and to reject the idea that reactionary political violence could ever be justified.\n\nThe divisions which the Right attempted to create in Peekskill are illustrative of a broader strategy implemented by reactionaries in their struggles against the Left. Opponents of Robeson sought not only to attack him as an individual, but they also sought to attack the institutions as well as the political and intellectual culture out of which his ideas emerged.\n\nIn thinking about the recent wave of right-wing hostility to leftist books, wokeness, and critical race theory, we should not forget to place this hostility within the context of a broader right-wing tradition. This is a tradition which runs through American history; but running parallel to it has always been a radical, progressive alternative to these antidemocratic tendencies.\n\nWhen I imagine Paul Robeson in Peekskill, I think of this. And though he would die - thanks to a backlash - in relative obscurity, his accomplishments are legion and his politics were prescient. Sometimes called the Great Forerunner, who powerfully quipped, \"The answer to injustice is not to silence the critic, but to end the injustice,\" his influence on the second half of the twentieth century and the early twenty-first is immeasurable.\n\nJoel Whitney is the author of Finks: How the CIA Tricked the World's Best Writers .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAn hour north of New York City just past the Hudson Line's Peekskill station, a golf course sprawls along ponds, sand dunes, and weeping willows. Before this idyllic green was carved from the wooded valley, my friends and I knew it as the defunct Hollowbrook Drive-In. With a giant L-shaped mid-century sign fading above an entrance on the far edge of a traffic circle, I recall during my middle and high school years the skunk weeds and dandelions breaking through asphalt that sprawled beneath a long-neglected screen. I pictured old films playing in black and white. But four decades before, the world-beloved actor, singer, activist, and lawyer Paul Robeson produced a concert here. What that concert spurred made our town infamous, associated forever with the phrase \"Peekskill riots.\"\n\nIt was late August when Robeson arrived. The concert was a fundraiser for the Civil Rights Congress, one of the many progressive organizations that fell victim to a right-liberal backlash against the social and economic policies of the Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) era. The start of the Cold War gave succor to conservatives eager to put brakes on a civil rights movement, whose most forceful advocates were radicals and socialists.\n\nThe day of the riots, Robeson and his entourage saw a burning cross on the hill above; racists pelted and flipped over some of the singer and his crew's cars; rioters effectively blocked the concert to supporters; and mobs slinging racial epithets against blacks, leftists, and Jews injured a dozen. A week and a day later, the concert proceeded. But damage was done: the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) gloated and plastered Peekskill with posters adorned with phrases lifted from fascist rioters during Kristallnacht.\n\nThinking back on my childhood, I found it strange how little I knew about these events. We never heard about Robeson in our history or social studies courses. A cultural amnesia had overcome our town, broken only by a small group of people who were able to draw a connection between the horrors of the past and the right-wing revanchism of the present. I wondered, too, whether something like this cultural amnesia was at play on a national scale. Did it explain how a country which had driven itself into a frenzy during McCarthyism could rally around a new red scare under the guise of anxieties over anti-leftist conspiracies, like \"Critical Race Theory\"?\n\nPaul Robeson was the son of William Drew Robeson, a runaway slave turned Presbyterian minister, who had fled from his captors to Princeton, New Jersey, in 1860 at the age of fifteen. From there he met Robeson's mother, Maria Louisa Bustil, a schoolteacher and member of a family of prominent anti-slavery and Jim Crow campaigners.\n\nOn Sundays, he would watch his father's weekly sermons boil over into operatic morality tales on the importance of race pride. The younger Robeson's own membership in this educated African American milieu allowed him to gain access to the more liberal parts of society. Although he would in his later years describe Princeton as still \"spiritually located in Dixie,\" it would provide Paul a starting point from which he would be admitted to Rutgers University on a full scholarship. At the respected institution, Robeson would go on to be the star of the university's glee club and an all-American for football.\n\nFrom New Jersey, Robeson would move to Harlem and apply to study at Columbia Law School before landing a job at Stotesbury and Associates, a prestigious Manhattan law firm. But here he hit a wall in the halfway world in which he was attempting to make a life for himself. A racist secretary informed Robeson's colleagues that she would not take dictation from a black man and the partner who hired him as a favor to a mutual friend warned that clients would not let Robeson represent them in court. Robeson took the hint and tried his luck on the stage.\n\nIn 1923, Robeson earned the lead in Eugene O'Neill's All God's Chillun Got Wings , one of his first major roles. The play depicted an interracial relationship between a white woman and her black husband, whose success she resents so deeply that it leads her to sabotage his budding law career. The resonances with themes in Robeson's own life must have been clear to him.\n\nControversially, the script called for the lead to kiss his costar, Mary Blair, the wife of the literary critic Edmund Wilson. Delays in the production caused by an illness which afflicted Blair during rehearsals led to an unusually long buildup which provided the media with an opportunity to work the public into a frenzy. Weeks before the play was due to air, the New York American published an article with the headline \"Riots Feared From Drama,\" and the Long Island chapter of the KKK threatened to blow up the theater.\n\nAlthough Robeson's director, Eugene O'Neill, and all of his costars came to his defense, dismissing the supposed controversy as not worthy of remark, reactionaries rallied around it. On opening night, steelworkers close to the cast guarded the dressing rooms from possible attacks as police fenced the theater in response to the numerous threats. Fortunately, these attacks did not materialize and although critics were generally not very enthused by the play, they praised Robeson's contribution. One went so far as to write that \"Caucasian superiority does suffer a little, because Paul Robeson is a far finer actor than any white member of the cast.\"\n\nThe Robesons would move to London in 1928 where Paul would star in a production of Show Boat , a West End musical adapted from a best-selling book about race relations in the American South. The appearance of Robeson was the talk of the town. On one occasion he was denied entry to the Savoy Grill, a fancy London eatery, and this incident became national news and was discussed in the Houses of Parliament.\n\nEven within the cosmopolitan world of the arts, Robeson felt that he struggled to reconcile his ideals with films in which he was cast. In 1934, the Hungarian-British filmmaker Zoltán Korda asked him to star in Sanders of the River , alongside Kenya's future president, the conservative leader Jomo Kenyatta. The film, which depicted British colonialism, was initially thought by Robeson to offer a harsh criticism of the institution. Black nationalists like Marcus Garvey would later ridicule Robeson for acting in what turned out to be another white man's burden narrative. Reflecting on these events, Robeson would describe the film as something that could have been \"shown in Italy and Germany, for it shows the Negro as Fascist States desire him - savage and childish.\"\n\nRobeson eventually landed a handful of films on the working-class struggle, stories more in line with his politics. In Song of Freedom (1936), he played a dockworker whose singing voice makes him famous, and whose fame allows him to investigate his regal bloodline in Africa. In Jericho (1937), he plays a heroic World War II officer who refuses an order to abandon ship to save the lives of his men. Robeson would truly hit his stride with a film on the plight of Welsh coal workers.\n\nThe relationship with these miners began a decade earlier, when Robeson emerged from a matinee performance of Show Boat back in London. He was confronted by a chanting crowd of Welsh miners, who had marched all the way from the neighboring country. They were on strike, blackballed, and going hungry. After taking them to eat, hearing of their union activity and their difficult position, with no other jobs in their region, Robeson took up their cause.\n\nHe visited Wales and brought their story to the screen in the musical The Proud Valley (1940), in which he plays a sympathetic American named Goliath. Without prospects in America, Goliath works in the Welsh mines, and ultimately, saves his comrades from a tunnel collapse. Historian Tony Benn recalls of the musical, \"It was through his contact with the Welsh miners that he realized he was working class, as well as black.\"\n\nIn 1934, during the Great Depression, Robeson first visited the Soviet Union on the invitation of the Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein. The auteur had hoped to direct Black Majesty , a film on the Haitian Revolution starring Robeson as the island's liberator, Toussaint Louverture. Though the partnership never panned out, his journey to the Soviet Union made clear to him the contrast between fascism and socialism. Going through Nazi Germany, state officials harassed Robeson for traveling with a white woman. \"I could read hatred in their eyes,\" Robeson thought while reflecting on this episode. \"This is how lynch mobs start.\"\n\nRobeson viewed international socialism as a great equalizer and the only real solution to fascism, and Robeson was impressed by a film shoot on a collective farm, which Eisenstein showed him. The constitution of the Soviet Union guaranteed in Article 123 full equality for all. Within the workers' state, Robeson could remark, \"Here, I walk in full human dignity.\"\n\nIn 1936, with a fascist coup overturning the elected left-wing government of Spain, Robeson made the consequential decision to deepen his commitment; he would relegate his career to second place, behind the anti-fascist struggle. \"I stand before you in unalterable support of the government of Spain, freely chosen by its sons and daughters,\" he told European audiences. \"The battlefield is everywhere. The artist must take sides. He must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice.\" Crisscrossing Spain, he sang to wounded soldiers and demoralized partisans in hospitals or depots on their way to the front. Singing in English, Spanish, and Russian, he aimed to bring hope to the leftist Republican forces.\n\nAs a greater European war loomed, Robeson and family prepared to return to the United States. But after spending so much time abroad, his reputation had dimmed in his homeland. At the height of the jingoistic fervor generated by the war, Robeson took on a patriotic musical produced by CBS, titled Ballad for Americans .

This is the forgotten story of Lovett Fort-Whiteman.\n\nLovett Fort-Whiteman speaking at the opening session of the founding convention of the American Negro Labor Congress in 1925. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe first African American to join the Communist Party was born in Texas, and died as a prisoner in a Soviet gulag.\n\nLovett Huey Whiteman was the son of a freed slave from South Carolina, Moses Whiteman, and Elizabeth Fort, a Texas native. In early adulthood Lovett replaced his middle name with his mother's maiden name, thereafter identifying himself as Lovett Fort-Whiteman.\n\nBorn in Dallas and educated in its segregated public schools, in 1905 Whiteman enrolled in Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, and upon graduation, spent a brief spell at Nashville's Fisk University. His mother soon left Dallas, without Moses, and moved to New York City, wherewith the wages from a job at a steamship company, she paid Lovett's college expenses and those of his younger sister, Hazel. By 1910 Elizabeth, Hazel, and Lovett had reunited in New York. Lovett aspired to become an actor, pianist, or showman, but Census records show him employed as a bellman.\n\nIn 1913 he ventured to the Yucatán Peninsula, where he worked as an accounting clerk in the hemp industry. Mexico was in the midst of its revolution and awash in radical ideas. While there, Fort-Whiteman picked up not only the Spanish language but the vernacular of the Left as well. When he returned to New York in 1917 he joined the Socialist Party of America (SP), starting a long career as a prominent radical. In 1926 Time magazine went so far as to label him as the \"blackest of the Reds.\" But much about his short life and tragic end remains a blank sheet, in part because he spent some fifteen years abroad, in places where records are either unavailable or unknown to American scholars.\n\nIn New York, Whiteman won his way into the company of the SP's leaders. Among them were A. Philip Randolph, founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; civil libertarian Elizabeth Gurley Flynn; Rose Pastor Stokes, a wealthy socialite and reformer; Robert Minor, a prominent newspaper cartoonist, born and raised in San Antonio; and Sen Katayama, a Japanese immigrant who would become a founder of Communist parties in the United States, Japan, and Mexico.\n\nFort-Whiteman was noteworthy because he represented a small but promising demographic in the Socialist Party: he was both black and American-born. A disproportionate number of the party's ranks were drawn from white European immigrants, and most of its few black members came from the West Indies.\n\nThe SP had some eighty thousand members in 1917, organized into language federations that held meetings and published newspapers in their native tongues. Though black Socialists were formally members of the English-speaking section, by 1919 the most militant of them also belonged to the African Blood Brotherhood (ABB), a group founded and dominated by newcomers from the West Indies.\n\nBy that time, however, purges and splits had reduced the SP's membership by half, a blow from which it never recovered. When the dust settled, two parties supportive of the Bolshevik Revolution had arisen, the Communist Party of America, whose members consisted mainly of immigrants, and the Communist Labor Party, composed mostly of native English speakers.\n\nDuring this period, Fort-Whiteman for a while wrote columns as a drama critic for a socialist weekly and, like Randolph, agitated for admitting black workers into American Federation of Labor (AFL) unions. Ultimately, he decided to take his lectures on the road. In September 1919, when he appeared at three Ohio and three Pennsylvania cities, his approach was ecumenical. He addressed syndicalist, socialist, and communist audiences, and in one instance, a church congregation. He financed his lectures by taking collections at his venues, and on money that Hazel sometimes sent.\n\nIn Mexico, Fort-Whiteman had absorbed the outlook of the Casa del Obrero Mundial, a syndicalist group - one that believes in worker, not state, ownership of industry - like the American \"Wobblies,\" or Industrial Workers of the World. In Youngstown, Ohio, Wobblies introduced him to a pamphlet , \"Justice for the Negro: How He Can Get It,\" a tract that didn't pull any punches. \"Throughout this land of liberty, so-called, the Negro worker is treated as an inferior,\" it declared. \"He is underpaid in his work and overcharged in his rent; he is kick about, cursed and spat upon; in short, he is treated, not as a human being, but as an animal, a beast of burden for the ruling class.\"\n\nWhen a Youngstown IWW member offered Fort-Whiteman a Wobbly membership book, paid through January 1920, he accepted it, along with hundreds of copies of \"Justice,\" which he distributed at subsequent speaking engagements.\n\nIn late September Whiteman reached St. Louis, with plans to visit Hazel, who had married and returned to Dallas. He came into town with Robert Minor, who was slated to give a speech there. Minor was no stranger to the city's newspaper readers: for six years before going to New York - where he had been the nation's highest-paid cartoonist - he had plied his trade at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . His three-hour lecture on the Soviet Union drew an audience of 1,200.\n\nFort-Whiteman had no such luck with his debuts. An October 10 appearance at the Jewish Labor Lyceum, sponsored by the Communist Labor Party, drew an audience of a dozen. Everyone in the meeting hall was arrested. Though in the ensuing weeks, others were released, while Fort-Whiteman and an immigrant attendee were held for months on charges of sedition, later dismissed.\n\nThe raid on his appearance was supervised by the Radical Division of the Bureau of Investigation, headed by a twenty-four-year-old J. Edgar Hoover. Over the summer of 1919 - the so-called Red Summer of riots and strikes - the bureau had infiltrated radical groups from coast to coast. It singled out Fort-Whiteman for special investigation, sending its agents in Dallas to question his sister Hazel. Its report reveals that she was adept at dissembling, and that the bureau was obsessed with race: \"Mrs. Harris is an educated and stylish negress,\" it said, \"the mistress of a rich and elegantly furnished home and mingles only with the aristocracy in darktown. . . . The sister swears that she never heard of her brother being mixed up in the race troubles . . . Speaking for herself she disclaims being a member of any organization or society or subscribing or reading any publications where social equality for the negro [sic] is advocated, preached or urged.\"\n\nThough the St. Louis office had a letter she had written to Lovett, the agents apparently took her denials at face value, perhaps because her husband stated that he forbid any mixing of his wife and \"niggers who want to be on equal footing with the white folks.\"\n\nBy 1924, the dueling Leninist parties had merged into one organization, the Communist Workers' Party, later known as the Communist Party USA. Early that year Fort-Whiteman represented both the African Blood Brotherhood and the Communist Party at a Chicago congress of black organizations, the Negro Sanhedrin. He afterward resettled in Chicago as a Communist organizer and, that summer, appeared before the Comintern in Moscow.\n\nIn the audience among the delegates he addressed were Joseph Stalin, Ho Chi Minh, and Fort-Whiteman's friend, Sen Katayama, by then living in Moscow as a member of the Comintern's Executive Committee and head of its American Bureau. Fort-Whiteman also won the confidence of Nikolai Bukharin, a theoretician who had been a companion to Lenin during their years in prerevolutionary exile, and who, in 1924, was a member of the Soviet Politburo.\n\nAt the end of the Comintern meeting, Fort-Whiteman stayed in Moscow as a student at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. He toured the USSR, was made an honorary member of a Ukrainian Cossack division, and, during a visit to Turkestan, supposedly rechristened itself as Whitemansky.\n\nWhile in the Soviet Union, Fort-Whiteman was also lobbying the Comintern on behalf of an idea. He proposed that the Communist Party create a group called the American Negro Labor Congress (ANLC), whose job would be to build union membership among blacks, to protest lynching and other outrages, and to challenge Jim Crow everywhere. In February 1925, the Comintern's Executive Committee accepted the idea and named Fort-Whiteman as its organizer. He returned to Chicago that month and for the next three years promoted the ANLC in lectures wherever he could, even at the Harvard Liberal Society.\n\nThe West Indian immigrants who had preceded him as Communists did not approve of his elevation. The ANLC was supposed to become a mass organization, one that included members whose only agreement with the Communist Party was with its racial program. But Fort-Whiteman, his detractors said, tied it too much to the party and the Soviets.\n\nThat tendency showed at the ANLC's founding convention in October 1925. Fort-Whiteman took charge of the entertainment for its opening night. He chose an ostensibly Russian ballet troupe and a Russian drama. The comrade who became known as Harry Haywood recalled it in these words:\n\nThe meeting took place in a hall on Indiana Avenue . . . in the midst of the Black ghetto. When I arrived it was packed -perhaps 500 people or so. Inside I was suddenly attracted by a commotion at the door. . . . I walked over to see what was the matter. Something was amiss with the \"Russian ballet\" which was about to enter the hall. A young blonde woman in the \"ballet\" had been shocked by the complexion of most of the audience, which she had apparently expected to be of a different hue. Loudly, in a broad Texas accent, she exclaimed. \"Ah'm not goin' ta dance for these niggahs!\"\n\nSomebody shouted, \"Throw the cracker bitches out!\" and the \"Russian\" dance group hurriedly left the hall.\n\nThe Russian actors remained to perform a one-act Pushkin play. They, at least were genuine Russians . . . But alas, it was in Russian. . . . Its relevance to a Black workers' congress was, to say the least, unclear.\n\nThough Robert Minor declared that the meeting gave the ANLC \"a splendid foundation,\" only a few dozen attendees, most of them Chicagoans, returned the next day.\n\nIt did not help that Fort-Whiteman wholeheartedly mimicked the Russians even in his mode of dress. As Haywood described him:\n\nFort-Whiteman was a truly fantastic figure. . . . He had affected a Russian style of dress, sporting a robochka (a man's long belted shirt) which came almost to his knees, ornamental belt, high boots and a fur hat. Here was a veritable Black Cossack who could be seen sauntering along the streets of Southside Chicago. . . . There was no doubt that he was a showman; he always seemed to be acting out a part he had chosen for himself.\n\nOther Communist activists found Fort-Whiteman remiss as an organizer. They were especially irritated that the ANLC's organ, The Negro Champion , was unable to publish regularly. (Sadly, the issues Fort-Whiteman edited have not survived.) Though they complained to Minor, then the head of the party's commission for \"Negro Work,\" he ignored them.\n\nOhio district organizer Israel Amter, a white man who, like Minor, was in the forefront of the intraparty crusade for multiracial organizing, reported to general secretary Charles Ruthenberg that on a recent visit \". . . Comrade Whiteman did not carry out the instructions of the Polcom, to the effect that after each meeting . . . he is to organize the workers into the branches of the ANLC. . . . He makes a speech and then disappears.\n\nBut Ruthenberg was apologetic in his reply a few days later. \"No doubt you have just cause to complain in regard to the way Whiteman handled the Negro meetings,\" he wrote. \"There are similar complaints . . . in regard to failure to make the meeting as scheduled. However, at the present time Whiteman represents the best material we have for our Negro work, and we must be as patient as possible, and endeavor to develop more responsibility in organizational work on his part.\"\n\nWhile the ANLC under Fort-Whiteman's leadership was stumbling along, a crisis was maturing in Moscow. When Lenin died in 1924, a power struggle began in the Politburo over who should take his place. Slowly Joseph Stalin gained the upper hand and showed his strength in 1926 by engineering the removal of Leon Trotsky, Lenin's choice as successor. Fort-Whiteman was not endangered by the move because he was a follower of Nikolai Bukharin, who had supported Trotsky's ouster.\n\nBut by 1928, Stalin was arguing inside the Politburo that capitalism was headed into tumult and decline. Reformists, he charged, would try to save it with reforms. In his mind, that made them enemies, not allies. Stalin called such groups \"social fascists.\" These included the AFL, the NAACP, and the Socialist Party.\n\nBukharin didn't agree. He had already questioned Stalin's plan for a crash industrialization in the USSR, and at the 1928 Comintern session, he argued that capitalism was not on the verge of collapse. Ruthenberg had by this time died, and Jay Lovestone, just thirty years old, a former leader of Socialists at the City College of New York, had taken his place. Alongside Bukharin, he argued that reform groups were not to be considered enemies to the Communist cause.\n\nLovestone brought Fort-Whiteman into play during deliberations about racism in the United States. Everyone agreed that due to their circumstances, American blacks could be reached by radical appeals. But they differed about when that would happen and how to facilitate the change.\n\nMost American blacks still worked in agriculture and lived in the South, where, as sharecroppers and tenant farmers, they formed a class similar to the European peasantry. Basing themselves on Marx's writings about the French Revolution and Paris Commune, most Marxists regarded peasants with suspicion, as a conservative, even reactionary, class.\n\nDuring the 1928 Comintern debates, Lovestone maintained that capitalism in the United States would continue to develop, and that blacks would continue to flee the farms for industrial jobs in the South, as well as the North. He foresaw no need to organize sharecroppers and tenant farmers because, he said, the American peasantry was being phased out. Fort-Whiteman buttressed Lovestone's position by preparing an address arguing that even organizations like the ANLC were not really necessary.\n\nRussian Cominternists took a dim view of Lovestone's \"American exceptionalist\" line, however. Years prior, Lenin was said to have remarked that the circumstances of African Americans looked to him like those of an \"oppressed national minority.\" This meant that American blacks had a right to \"national self-determination,\" a status that the Bolsheviks claimed. Their \"nationalist\" program found favor with Sen Katayama and the ABB members who had migrated to the Communist cause. It noted that in some two hundred counties from East Texas to Virginia, blacks constituted the majority population, yet were effectively barred from voting. The area that was called the Southern Black Belt, they said, could potentially become a republic of the Soviet-style.\n\nThe Comintern defused this dispute by adopting both the integrationist and nationalist proposals. It ordered the American Communists to organize the South, to agitate for both the right of self-determination and for the unionization of industry on a racially integrated basis. But the Comintern did not compromise about the coming collapse of capitalism. Bukharin and Lovestone's theses were roundly defeated.\n\nFort-Whiteman remained in Moscow when the conference ended. But as might have been expected, in 1929 Bukharin was purged from the Soviet Politburo and Lovestone was expelled from the American Party.\n\nYet even with his allies in disarray, Fort-Whiteman found a job as a teacher at a school for English-speaking students, most of them the children of technicians who had been contracted to assist Stalin's industrialization push. An American journalist who visited the school in 1932 reported that Whiteman claimed to be a graduate of the University of Chicago and \"speaks English in a beautifully modulated Oxford drawl.\" Perhaps he was acting again.\n\nHe soon tried his hand at scriptwriting. In June 1932 the cast of a proposed movie about black life in Birmingham, Alabama arrived by boat to Leningrad. Among its twenty-two members was the poet Langston Hughes. Fort-Whiteman hired a brass band to greet them with \"The International\" as they disembarked, then escorted the crew to Moscow, where its members stayed in high style as state guests. But the film, tentatively named \"Black and White,\" was never made. Its chief writer, a Russian whom Fort-Whiteman assisted, hadn't the faintest idea of what black life in the United States was about, and Politburo members opposed the project because they feared it would complicate the USSR's diplomatic relations. After more than two months of wrangling, the would-be actors went home.\n\nFort-Whiteman, ever the polymath, soon landed a two-year fellowship in ethnology at Moscow University and somehow parlayed that into a job as a researcher on fish breeding. But in 1933, he requested permission from the American party to return to its ranks. His letter was snagged by Soviet authorities, who rather than forwarding it, entered it into police records.\n\nIn his off-hours, expat Fort-Whiteman often dined with visiting American blacks, especially party members. In early 1936, following a hot dispute with American comrades, he was banished to Alma-Ata, a city in Kazakhstan that had been Trotsky's first stop on his way to exile. There Fort-Whiteman became a schoolteacher again. But the Soviet police did not forget about him. In early 1937 Bukharin was arrested, given a show trial and convicted of conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. A year later he was shot. Within two months of his execution, Fort-Whiteman was rearrested and sentenced to five years of hard labor at a gulag in the gold-mining fields of Siberia.\n\nAccording to a fellow inmate, he was frequently unable to meet work quotas and was punished with beatings. Either from those or from unknown causes, he lost his teeth. On January 13, 1939, at the age of forty-nine, he died in the gulag, his death certificate said, of \"heart failure.\" Had an admirer penned the certificate, it might have plainly said that he died of a broken heart.\n\nDick J.

He had already questioned Stalin's plan for a crash industrialization in the USSR, and at the 1928 Comintern session, he argued that capitalism was not on the verge of collapse. Ruthenberg had by this time died, and Jay Lovestone, just thirty years old, a former leader of Socialists at the City College of New York, had taken his place. Alongside Bukharin, he argued that reform groups were not to be considered enemies to the Communist cause.\n\nLovestone brought Fort-Whiteman into play during deliberations about racism in the United States. Everyone agreed that due to their circumstances, American blacks could be reached by radical appeals. But they differed about when that would happen and how to facilitate the change.\n\nMost American blacks still worked in agriculture and lived in the South, where, as sharecroppers and tenant farmers, they formed a class similar to the European peasantry. Basing themselves on Marx's writings about the French Revolution and Paris Commune, most Marxists regarded peasants with suspicion, as a conservative, even reactionary, class.\n\nDuring the 1928 Comintern debates, Lovestone maintained that capitalism in the United States would continue to develop, and that blacks would continue to flee the farms for industrial jobs in the South, as well as the North. He foresaw no need to organize sharecroppers and tenant farmers because, he said, the American peasantry was being phased out. Fort-Whiteman buttressed Lovestone's position by preparing an address arguing that even organizations like the ANLC were not really necessary.\n\nRussian Cominternists took a dim view of Lovestone's \"American exceptionalist\" line, however. Years prior, Lenin was said to have remarked that the circumstances of African Americans looked to him like those of an \"oppressed national minority.\" This meant that American blacks had a right to \"national self-determination,\" a status that the Bolsheviks claimed. Their \"nationalist\" program found favor with Sen Katayama and the ABB members who had migrated to the Communist cause. It noted that in some two hundred counties from East Texas to Virginia, blacks constituted the majority population, yet were effectively barred from voting. The area that was called the Southern Black Belt, they said, could potentially become a republic of the Soviet-style.\n\nThe Comintern defused this dispute by adopting both the integrationist and nationalist proposals. It ordered the American Communists to organize the South, to agitate for both the right of self-determination and for the unionization of industry on a racially integrated basis. But the Comintern did not compromise about the coming collapse of capitalism. Bukharin and Lovestone's theses were roundly defeated.\n\nFort-Whiteman remained in Moscow when the conference ended. But as might have been expected, in 1929 Bukharin was purged from the Soviet Politburo and Lovestone was expelled from the American Party.\n\nYet even with his allies in disarray, Fort-Whiteman found a job as a teacher at a school for English-speaking students, most of them the children of technicians who had been contracted to assist Stalin's industrialization push. An American journalist who visited the school in 1932 reported that Whiteman claimed to be a graduate of the University of Chicago and \"speaks English in a beautifully modulated Oxford drawl.\" Perhaps he was acting again.\n\nHe soon tried his hand at scriptwriting. In June 1932 the cast of a proposed movie about black life in Birmingham, Alabama arrived by boat to Leningrad. Among its twenty-two members was the poet Langston Hughes. Fort-Whiteman hired a brass band to greet them with \"The International\" as they disembarked, then escorted the crew to Moscow, where its members stayed in high style as state guests. But the film, tentatively named \"Black and White,\" was never made. Its chief writer, a Russian whom Fort-Whiteman assisted, hadn't the faintest idea of what black life in the United States was about, and Politburo members opposed the project because they feared it would complicate the USSR's diplomatic relations. After more than two months of wrangling, the would-be actors went home.\n\nFort-Whiteman, ever the polymath, soon landed a two-year fellowship in ethnology at Moscow University and somehow parlayed that into a job as a researcher on fish breeding. But in 1933, he requested permission from the American party to return to its ranks. His letter was snagged by Soviet authorities, who rather than forwarding it, entered it into police records.\n\nIn his off-hours, expat Fort-Whiteman often dined with visiting American blacks, especially party members. In early 1936, following a hot dispute with American comrades, he was banished to Alma-Ata, a city in Kazakhstan that had been Trotsky's first stop on his way to exile. There Fort-Whiteman became a schoolteacher again. But the Soviet police did not forget about him. In early 1937 Bukharin was arrested, given a show trial and convicted of conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. A year later he was shot. Within two months of his execution, Fort-Whiteman was rearrested and sentenced to five years of hard labor at a gulag in the gold-mining fields of Siberia.\n\nAccording to a fellow inmate, he was frequently unable to meet work quotas and was punished with beatings. Either from those or from unknown causes, he lost his teeth. On January 13, 1939, at the age of forty-nine, he died in the gulag, his death certificate said, of \"heart failure.\" Had an admirer penned the certificate, it might have plainly said that he died of a broken heart.\n\nDick J.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWith a Fox News-animated bigot in the White House and inequality at spectacular heights, discussion of American racism has returned to the center of US politics. The wealth of those categorized as black evaporated under the Obama administration, and today, the Trump administration restricts freedom of movement to scapegoat migrants for economic crisis, while casting white supremacists and those who fight them in the streets as morally equivalent , bestowing Oval Office-granted legitimacy to racist violence .\n\nIt's a terrifying situation that that has led many to seek out explanations of its historical roots. A recent criticism of Ta-Nehisi Coates by Cornel West became a means to debate not only the origins of racism and class inequality, but also the most effective means of fighting both in the US and globally. In this moment, the US left can advance a deeper and broader conversation about how racism functions in neoliberal, imperial America, and how to build working-class organizations that fight for social justice for all.\n\nBut that opportunity requires overcoming a powerful ideological legacy . The dominance of neoliberalism frames inequality as deriving from personal responsibility or the lack thereof and replaces structural analysis with a focus on \" race relations .\"\n\nThis is possible because of the enshrinement of race as a natural category, the spread of the fiction that certain traits define members of one \"race\" and differentiate them from members of other races. No one has better diagnosed the problems with this categorization than Barbara and Karen Fields, authors of the 2012 book Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life . In an interview that aired on The Dig , Daniel Denvir interviews Barbara and Karen Fields about the police violence, the illusion of race, and how we can fight for working-class liberation.\n\nA recent Gallup poll found that Americans worry about race relations at a record rate. But the framework of race relations implies that the problems of race in America are based in some unfortunate interpersonal lack of understanding, rather than in racism and the capitalist order that racism helps maintain. Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life opened my eyes to the fact that this race-relations framework should be disturbing on an even more basic level. Race relations, after all, presume that there are distinct entities called races: white, black, Asian, native, and maybe even Hispanic. The idea of race, Racecraft shows, is rooted in the practice of racism and the eugenicist, biological racist notion that something - whether it is blood or genes - has created a set of scientifically distinct groupings of people.\n\nMy guests today are the authors of this seminal book, the brilliant sister duo comprised of historian Barbara Fields and sociologist Karen Fields. They make a persuasive case that our continuing commitment to the very idea of race helps perpetuate and strengthen racism. It also bolsters capitalism by placing a huge obstacle in front of working people realizing their common interest in coming together to fight their bosses. I want to start by asking you both to lay out the central argument of your book. I'm going to take a stab at it first and see if I get it right. \"Racecraft\" doing its work in the shadows naturalizes and reifies the visible existence of race, and race is a prerequisite for racism, but it is the action or practice of racism that is really the motor of the historical roots of race.\n\nThere are some problems there. One of them is your statement that race is a prerequisite for racism; it's the other way around. Racism being an action: it is acting on a double standard based on ascribed or putative ancestry. Racism, in other words, is neither attitude nor bigotry nor prejudice. It is an act, and it is a repetition of the act of racism that makes race looks like a real entity. That is what has happened in American history.\n\nAnd the term racecraft, which you coined, describes that relationship between racism and race?\n\nRacecraft encompasses the fact that the race that is pictured by the subjects as real in fact is not; it's made to be real and envisioned collectively as something real. People begin to think, \"I have a racial identity, I have a race. As a black person or white person, I have certain characteristics: I'm smart; I deserve to be at the bottom, and so on.\" These things are programmed into people through the activity of doing that first thing, the act that is ostensibly based on heritage. That puts somebody in his or her place.\n\nThe way I sometimes explain this to my students is by comparing it to a sideshow. There used to be a part of carnival sideshows where a magician would cut a woman in two. It was all done with mirrors and so on, but it looked real and the audience was spellbound by it. By the end of the show, the lady would come back on the stage along with the magician so that everyone could see that it was a conjuring trick. Racecraft is a conjuring trick that does not need a conjurer. The onlookers' minds are also conjuring the spectacle for them.\n\nRacecraft does not end with the performer and the illusion appearing on the stage in their rightful being. It's a permanent illusion. It can be a death-dealing illusion. One of the examples or groups of examples we keep coming back to in Racecraft is that of the police officer. For example, an Afro-American police officer or, in a few instances, a Latino police officer, is mistaken as a criminal by fellow police officers. This is a consequence of racecraft that can end with someone's death. A police officer who knows himself to be a police officer appears to be a black man to another police officer, who then carries out an execution.\n\nThen one of the ways that sort of incident is popularly understood is that the person is killed because of his skin color. You both write about how that transfers the action of racism from the perpetrator to the victim.\n\nThat's one of our main points: that race transforms the act of the perpetrator into a characteristic of the target. Race transforms one person's action into another person's being. We see this happen every day and people who are the targets participate in it as well because they can't help it. It's not a voluntary action. It is part of what we're engulfed in because we live in a society where racist action is our reality.\n\nPeople may experience it in a way that they take ownership of it. They believe that they are what racecraft made them. Race is an identification - an attaching of a label or a name to somebody. It's not an identity of a person for him or herself, but it quickly has that transmogrification in thinking about identity. As a black woman, when I have an identity that's not a black woman, it's as Karen Fields, and that comes first.\n\nYou see it clearly in an episode that happened in 1999. Amadou Diallo , an immigrant from Guinea, was shot by the NYPD because the police were looking for a black rapist.\n\nThe newspapers talked about it as something that had happened to him because of his identity, which couldn't have been more wrong. His identity had nothing to do with being a black man as the police probably identified him; he probably, if he didn't think of himself as a Guinean, thought of himself as a Malinké or whatever his people were. That's how he thought of himself but it didn't make any difference. The police officers' identification of him was what controlled the moment, not his identity as he defined it. That is one of the characteristics of racism. Even though the targets may imagine that their race is their identity, and it is an identification they can choose to identify with as others identify them, racism determines that one can override the other.\n\nOne thing that you two talk about is how deeply held this belief - or really, ideology - is that even among devout opponents of racism, there is the idea that racism is prejudice related to something objective called race. How does that thinking play into liberal anti-racism?\n\nPart of it has to deal with the liberal anti-racists evacuating the class content of American society. So they can talk about race and racism in a vacuum. As soon as you do it that way you are in a self-defeating cycle because then you have people you've identified as a race who are permanent targets and victims, but they have no access to politics - you don't even conceive it as a political situation. That's one of the things that I see going on today with the overdevelopment of whiteness into an all-encompassing something that makes politics and history disappear.\n\nWhiteness has become something that seems to have an all-encompassing explanatory power. One of the most prominent purveyor of this sort of thinking - a smart but in some ways misguided one - is Ta-Nehisi Coates, who is a leading proponent of this kind of whitelash argument that figures white supremacy and whiteness as not only foundational, but seemingly immutable and primordial . The recent popularity of these arguments reminds me of a line from your book that talks about a treatment of race that has it so that race, having arisen historically, then ceases to be a historical phenomenon and becomes instead an external motor of history.\n\nIt reminds me of a line from my mentor, the great historian C. Vann Woodward . In talking about white supremacy in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, he said the question was never white supremacy; it was which whites would be supreme. That's one of things this argument covered up then and covers up now. Not all white people have the same power and not all white people are in the same class position. Even if you can argue convincingly that they all have bigotry and prejudice - even if you do that - then you have to acknowledge that not everyone has the same level of power and responsibility. Therefore, not everybody figures the same way in any plans we might try to have to get out of this situation. We're living in the midst of the most unrelenting and successful period of class warfare in American history. The targets are working people, all kinds of working people, and the more we allow ourselves to look away from the structural political reasons for it, the more we are helping those who have their feet on our necks.\n\nWhy do you think that many on the liberal left find the analysis of Trump's rise that begins and ends with whiteness and racism - obviously Trump is a virulent racist - but this analysis of racism that lacks political and economic context: why is that attractive to so many?\n\nIt's a mystery to me unless I consider how little historical knowledge or reading they have about how class societies operate, even our own. It is attractive to think that the thing to consider is our identities and how to learn to get along with each other - how to have good interracial race relations. They didn't know when cotton was the product produced by slaves in the South and white people that didn't count in the mills; that didn't enter into the history our generation has inherited. It's good to state that there has been some history recently that has brought that into view.\n\nThere has also been a period of such intense political demobilization that large numbers of people - certainly it's true for people the age of my students, but it's also true of the people who like to think of themselves as the opinion-setters, the scribbling and babbling classes, the people who write for the general public, and so on - can't tell which end is up.\n\nMy sister and I are old enough that we were at the 1963 March of Washington , which has now become almost a mythic event. One thing that is indelibly part of our memory of that occasion is that many of the people in the crowd that assembled were wearing the insignia of the UAW, International Ladies Garment Workers Union, Steelworkers, Mineworkers, and so on. The march's official designation was a March for Jobs and Freedom. It was part of political mobilization at that time: in the midst of the Cold War and the purges, people understood the connection between labor and civil rights. The honorary leader, the person's whose idea it was, A. Philip Randolph , was a labor organizer, a union activist as well as an activist in demanding rights for black people. Those connections were so natural that even dummies and political novices understood them. They have been gone for a long time and the result is that when somebody in the press says working class or working-class voters, they invariably mean white people. They forgot that most Afro-Americans in this country are working people . Most Latinos, however you define that ambiguous term, are working people. Southeast Asian migrants, most of them are working people, and indeed the same is true of a good many East Asian migrants.\n\nWe have allowed that language to become part of the whiteness talk . The result is that when things happen - as they are happening hot and heavy today targeted against working people - our reaction fragments us so that we cannot even talk about it that way. It's this attack on people of color or that attack on black people, or immigrants, or Dreamers , or whatever it is. We're not going to get anywhere that way, because we have defined any possible political alliance out of existence before we even tried to build it. If Ta-Nehisi Coates - I like him a lot, by the way, and have only met him a couple of times and some of his work is deeply moving - but if he were right about the situation, you would have to say there is no exit ; there is nothing we can do. It reminds me of what people would say about the prospect of nuclear war back in the days when we had air-raid drills: the only thing you can do about it is put your head between your legs and kiss your behind goodbye.\n\nThat seems to be the political prescription that comes out of the primordial white racism argument. There's nothing to do about it but to put your head between your legs and kiss your behind goodbye.\n\nThe corollary argument is that attempts to talk about class are efforts to distract from racism or exculpate the white working class for its bigotries.\n\nThat is a devastating, intolerable mistake. It leads people to say that race is fundamental - not economics, not class - and if you bring class in then you're trying to deny the reality of human existence and identity. That is the big mystification achieved by racecraft. It looks like a relation between people or race relations, but it's really a submerged economic relation : that's the American ideology. We have an economic order that is untouchable because people live in identities without understanding that they are living in the world of work. In the era of a strong labor movement, they were fighting fights to get rights and now that's not even legitimate in the eyes of some people.\n\nI'd like to ask some of the people who believe deeply in the framework that says it all has to do with the white psyche: What do we do about it? Do we sit back and allow this juggernaut to roll over us? Or do we do something about it? And if we do something, what is it? The thing about that argument always was that if this is something that is fundamental, that is built into white people, then it has to be built into everybody. It has to be built into black people as well. If you don't believe that it's built into everybody, then you're back with the first premise of racism, which is that there is not one human species, but many.\n\nThat's a very important point. The primordial account of white racism has as its necessary corollary biological race theory as well.\n\nIt has to or they are left saying that this is programmed into white people but it's not programmed into anybody else. How can this happen that it's not programmed into anybody else? Well, the only way that can arise is by accepting a really old and discredited notion of separate creation or different races. Otherwise, you have to assume that this whiteness thing is everybody's creation. I've never been presented face to face with someone who is ready to carry this argument through. I'd like to be because I want to hear what they say about this. If white people have this, doesn't everybody have to have it? If everybody has it, then how do you account for any of the moments in history when it has been possible to break free of some of it? When it has been possible to have cracks in the structure? When there have been alliances among people who are in the opposition?\n\nThe other big political problem with the primordial account of racism seems to be that the upshot for self-interested white people reading that account would be to act in defense of white supremacy. If racism is good for white people, won't that convince white people to be racist? It's interesting that a lot of contemporary white supremacists or white nationalists refer to white people embracing racism as \"race-realism.\" Another term that's in vogue is \"human biodiversity.\" It's telling that these avowedly racist white supremacists seem very aware that believing in the primordial account of race is a critical part of racism.\n\nIt's a catechism that includes the inherent distinctness of different people corresponding to the names that human beings invented for them.\n\nIt does not serve those of us on the Left to believe that the tools of tribalism will ever be tools of liberation. They can't be.\n\nAnother dimension runs through this. My educational trajectory has gone through the great sociologist Max Weber. In a collection called The Social Psychology of the World Religions , he said that what is fundamental to religion is an explanation of misfortune, a theodicy that explains why some people do well and some don't. There is calm in society if everyone shares that theodicy.\n\nRace thought is religious in that sense. It is there to answer the question of why people who are doing well are blessed, and to state that those that didn't do well must have something wrong with them. Let's find out what it was: Is it the skin color which entails low intelligence or laziness? It becomes a language for explaining the facts or state of affairs without actually doing so, but with a mystique that people then take on because they have the objects, they have the races that have been daily constructed by the rituals that we go through that establish the inferiority of some people and the superiority of others. Barbara and I emphasize those actions that go on because we are not talking about a thing, a set of ideas as a thing. We're talking about actions that both express and recreate those ideas. Chapter Two of our book is about things you can see if you're paying attention while walking down the street: rituals that establish bad fortune for some and good fortune for others and the feeling of it if you're in it yourself. If you are on the committee that designs the segregation law for Charleston, you benefit from it psychologically. You explain the situation of others to your satisfaction.\n\nThat's underlining an important point I wanted to ask you about, which is how the practice of racism conjures up and creates race again and again. We discussed the case of Amadou Diallo, who had the category of blackness imposed on him and died in a hail of forty-one bullets in 1999. Other things that come to mind as examples of how racism reproduces race are the huge numbers of black people in prison and how that not only marks black people as criminal but also produces blackness. There are similar things with residential and school segregation, and how the black ghetto or the almost entirely black urban public school seems to many people to be the result of black pathology rather than of racism.\n\nThat's the way it gets translated into the thought patterns of ordinary Americans, that's an accurate representation about how they form their notions. They read in the paper about the numbers of black people in prison, and that helps solidify their identification of black people with criminality. They don't have to experience it all to know that it is a reality and a characteristic of black people.\n\nOne of my colleagues had me in stitches one year talking about a remark someone had made about how he or she felt seeing a black person approach on the street. They said \"I just can't help remembering some statistic that three out of every four black people are in prison.\" The purpose was to say, \"I have a reason to feel uneasy when I see a black person approaching me on the street.\" My colleague said \"well, if three out of every four black people are in prison, then they can't approach you on the street. So you don't need to fear them.\" It's reductio ad absurdum, but that is the way people are inclined to form their notions about human beings about whom they know very little. It informs the experiences that they will then have in dealing with those people.\n\nJust before you called I was out walking my dog in an area that is controlled by the NYC Parks Department, and it's next to a playground where dogs are not allowed. A white man, I have to characterize him this way because he soon proved that's that what he was, had left his dog tied up next to the playground where it had no business while he was at the far end playing with his daughter on the swing. The dog was standing in a way that made it impossible for me to approach with my dog. I approached the man and asked if it was his dog. He immediately went into attack mode. He said, \"Are you the park police? I'm just out here with my daughter? It's a big park.\" I didn't say anything to him; I thought afterwards that I should have said that one way to react in a situation like this is to say \"Oh I'm sorry,\" knowing that you are legally in the wrong. Instead, his reaction was that he sees an elderly black woman approaching with her dog, his reaction has nothing to do with respect to an older person or respect with the law, and he is right away a white person facing down a black person. He didn't say any of that and I wish I had made him say it. I'm a teacher and I missed a moment where I could have taught him something. Because there he is with his two year old daughter and he is teaching her to a be a big so and so-\n\nRacist.\n\nAs he is.\n\nIt's the worst feeling to come up with the best comeback just a minute or two too late.\n\nMy friends used to call it the spirit of the stairway. It's that moment that embodies all the moments like that. It doesn't just have to be the racist moments, either. Our society being what it is, it often takes the form of racist moments because the person who knows he has put his dog in the wrong place and that he is violating the law, when confronted by a black person, will go right to the ground where he is uppermost and not think that this is an instance where courtesy and fellow feeling should take precedent.\n\nThis reminds me of the discussion in the book about DuBois and the notion of double consciousness. Something that was palpable for me reading the book was that it seemed to be motivated by both of your very understandable lifelong frustrations with not being approached as Karen and Barbara Fields, but being immediately interpellated as black women.\n\nThat's right and that's one of the sources of the book itself. We have gone back and forth about the things of this sort that have happened in the heights of academe. Barbara comes down the street and tries to say hello to someone because they are in the same building and he jumps as if he is going to be attacked. He doesn't recognize that she is a colleague. There is no amount of time you can be there without seeming like you don't belong there. In the university, I wrote a draft called Race Matters in the American Academy and described things like using people's names, things that had happened establishing superiority in subtle and unsubtle ways. I circulated an open list and said \"write back if anyone of these things is inaccurate.\" No one wrote a word.\n\nOur father was an architect who had a practice later in his career. He was a solo practitioner and a good bit of his work was for the Roman Catholic Church. The thing about being an architect is that often your clients don't have to see you in person. Many of his clients were dealing with the firm, but they had no idea who the principal of the firm was. He told us that there was not a day that went by without someone reminding him that he was black. His office was upstairs in a three-story federal building in Washington, D.C., and when he had to meet a client, he had to come downstairs, and he described the face of this person as he saw a black person coming down the steps and realized that was the Bob Fields he had been talking to as an architect and suddenly Bob Fields materialized as a black man and he doesn't know what to do about it.\n\nThere were dozens of those situations and they teach all the people who are participating so much about how the world works. I was talking about one of them in the article that appeared in Racecraft . This was a little boy who was the son of one of the staff members of the department where I taught for a semester at Ole Miss. The mother was a white woman but everyone there were merely people. They were all decent people. One day she told me that her son had come back from the playground and his mother asked him if the playmate was black, and the boy said, \"No he's brown.\" We all chuckled. For everyone, it was a story about the innocence of childhood and about the fact that children don't know anything about races. They don't come naturally to racism. But the next level of the story was about what that little boy learned when his mother chuckled. He learned that the answer he gave was not the right answer. Grown-ups like it and they laugh at it, but the fact that they laugh tells the kid it's not the right answer. The next time he is asked that question, he knows that to ask if his playmate is black is not to ask for a description but to ask for a classification.\n\nThis is every American child's miseducation in racecraft.\n\nYes, it is, but it also is Oxford, Mississippi in Ole Miss, which still lives in infamy. It is also an illustration of a white person who is happy because her child is growing up free of racism. That's what stimulates the chuckle. Here's a person whose faith is good, whose will is good, whose intentions are good. She's reacting to a situation that could happen anywhere in the country, but her reaction to it is \"I'm so glad that my little boy isn't a racist\" and she winds up teaching him what a friend referred to as \"learning how to color.\"\n\nChildren have to learn it. It's not programmed. We don't have it automatically. Somehow, they learn how to color. They can learn in innocent situations, even heartwarming situations, or they learn at a country club swimming pool. Karen knows this story better than I do: there was a country club swimming pool where the children had been permitted to go. The director gave permission, but the members were not privy to it. There was a reaction of horror when all these black children show up. One little girl - these are children they don't understand what the fuss is about - asked if she was too dark to go swimming.\n\nThe black children and maybe also Hispanic, I'm not sure, come into this pool in suburban Philadelphia and white parents are in a panic pulling their children from their water\n\nRunning as though something had come from the jungle.\n\nFrom what I understood, it's not that the children were afraid. It's that their parents were panic-stricken and dragged their children out. Karen was the one who first came upon this episode. The point she made was that if you see it at first you have an immediate reaction, any decent person has a reaction to that. The next reaction on reflection that Karen had was that the news media are prepared to cover this from the standpoint of the black children and how they felt about it. It was one of them that featured the girl who asked if she was too dark to go swimming. Karen asked what the white children thought of the situation.\n\nThey didn't try to find out.\n\nIt's the kind of incident that will teach those young white people to have the same beliefs about race that their parents showed in grabbing them out of the water.\n\nThat must have been terrifying.\n\nThe other point is that just as the little black child did not know what it was about neither did the white children at first. And some of them will have reacted no doubt, because children react this way when they see something that is not fair. That is a reaction that comes out of young children in their own play situations. Some of those white children probably reacted with distress to what happened.\n\nAnd were told by their parents that it was necessary, natural, and normal?\n\nYeah. We don't know what conversations happened after that and what questions the white children asked. People who make an overwhelming monster of whiteness, they aren't looking at the textural details of something like that. If they did, they would have to focus on something that is historical and particular to situations.\n\nIt is contingent and thus can be defeated.\n\nAll of the great thinkers about human societies who have tried to tackle it start with the assumption that if we figured how this thing came into being, then we can figure out how to put an end to it. This was Marx's approach in talking about capitalism in Capital . C. Vann Woodward did this when talking about segregation: for all the attacks that scholars had on his work since then, his main point was \"if I can figure out how this thing started then I can figure out how to stop it.\" If we don't have a historical understanding of these things, then we are trapped in a kind of Groundhog Day. This thing just keeps going on and going and going on, and we have no clue how it began and therefore no clue about how we might put it to an end. That's the crime of this type of thinking.\n\nYou chose the term racecraft by way of analogizing it to witchcraft. Could you lay out how witchcraft operates and why the analogy works?\n\nThere's a reason that the analogy works that doesn't serve my purposes. People think it means dismissal, that it has no intellectual worth because witchcraft isn't true. I was working on African religions before I came to this project. There was something happening in the area that I was studying with witchcraft removal revival. It was a very active cleaning of evil out of countries and anthropologists became interested because they wondered how people who otherwise seem practical have ideas like this.\n\nOne brilliant scholar, E. E. Evans-Pritchard wrote that we have these ideas, too. He wrote Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande to show the rational processes used. The rational processes evolved along with what we are doing. For example, we usually believe in cause and effect, if you kick a ball, then it usually is going to go down the way. If somebody says that if you touch this black person, you're going to get sick and it's believed, then it means that there is a different process. Let's not assume they're dumb. There's a process. One thing that goes along with systems of belief that do not rely on causality is precisely that: you have freedom to invent social reality that everyone shares verbally and experientially. So, I found it useful to read about witchcraft because there was so much kinship. We have bright people and we have things happen. We have foiled predictions and those don't die. You can't get rid of the prediction that black people are stupid or violent. You just can't. For me, it was a lens that allowed me to see better what had existed in my own society.\n\nMaybe looking at Evans-Pritchard's most well-known examples from that book which I read as a young undergrad anthropology major might help elucidate the analogy further. If I remember correctly there is a scene where some sort of building maybe a granary roof falls down on someone's head and kills them, and immediately witchcraft is suspected. Can you lay out what happens?\n\nHe says that it is an event that falls into the category of things that can happens as a result of witchcraft. The methods Evans-Pritchard describes are oracular methods or divinatory methods. You figure out which it is. Whether it is witchcraft or something else. They are experts at doing that. Then you figure out who in the same way. There are ways where you might find proof in the body of somebody who is a relative who died of the person who is suspected of witchcraft and so on. The things that rationality can achieve on the surface of things are not rational because witchcraft is not possible. It's amazing. The center of witchcraft is what I was saying a while ago, the theodicy problem again. Why do bad things happen to good people? There is a set of answers. They are not stupid, but it's a way of thinking that is human to the core.\n\nIndependently, we found ourselves comparing race the way it works in American society to witchcraft. I did it in an article in which I was arguing against the primordialists who think that there is nothing to explain historically because it has always been there in white people. We both ended up with the analogy of witchcraft. In both instances, the necessary first step was that we had to have some kind of intellectual detachment from American society and the American version of race thinking. It can be an actual physical detachment, but you have to have a way of taking a distance from it. In another article, I said that otherwise you are trying to lift something up while you are standing on it. You can't lift it if you don't step off. The stepping off is taking a distance from the way that people think about race in America.\n\nFor me, one of the most dramatic ways that happened was when I spent time in Tanzania , which Karen did before I did. I learned to speak Swahili. In Swahili, the words for black and white were never used to distinguish people of African descent from people of European descent. If they used \"nyeupe\" and \"nyeusi\" which are black and white in Swahili, they were using them the same way we might speak of blond or brunette, or light complexion or dark complexion, like the little boy. It was a color distinction. When they were actually trying to distinguish white from black, the way Americans might do it, they had words that had to do with national origin. An African was Mwafrika. A person of European extraction was Mzungu, which could also be an American.\n\nOne particular episode that crystallized things for me was an Afro-American woman who had married a Tanzanian and had lived in Tanzania for a long time. She was fluent in Swahili and thought of herself as an African person. She stood out on the streets of Dar es Salaam because she always dressed in elaborate West African boubous and lace and headpieces and all the rest of the costume that a working-class Tanzanian could not afford. While she was identifying herself as African in this way, she was setting herself apart but she didn't realize it. One day I encountered her almost in tears because a Tanzanian had referred to her as \"mzungu,\" European, a white person. She said, \"How could you call me mzungu, I am mwafrika, how can you say that?\" Well, they could say that because she had the money, she had the bearings; she had all the appurtenances of the people who would be called mzungu. That meant that this whole way of talking about people's origins or their belongings or the way they looked just was incommensurable with the way we talk about it in the United States.\n\nI needed to experience that in order to be able to write about race when I came back home and went to graduate school. That was being in a place where I was surrounded with black people, but not black people - they were Watanzania or Mwafrika. There was a Ghanaian woman in the circle that I moved in when I was there who was actually criticized by some of the local people because she couldn't speak Swahili and they couldn't believe it. They thought she was just being a snob. So I had a whole system of classification to understand that was engaged in by people that would be simply called black people by Americans. That turned race into a historical phenomenon for me so when I wrote about it later, I couldn't write about it the way the primordialists did.\n\nThe story you tell about this woman in Dar es Salaam is in some ways the inverse of Amadou Diallo's story and racial classification systems being lost in translation. In Diallo's case it was tragic and horrific; in the woman's case it was farcical. They point towards similar lessons.\n\nI have long thought about that situation, and that if the police officers had realized he was African, they wouldn't have shot him. They, in other words, make a distinction between black people and Africans. It's not visible. They may think you can see, but you cannot see. Had they had an inkling when they approached that apartment building that they were dealing with an African immigrant they would not have reacted the way he did.\n\nThey would have been more likely to think he was reaching for his wallet, as he was.\n\nOr they might not have assumed he was an armed rapist in the first place. He was reacting to what he thought were armed thugs who came into the place shouting. He thought he could buy them off by giving them his wallet. No white police officer would ever assume a black person would react to a white person as to a street thug. It didn't occur to them. They dressed as street thugs because it was their undercover outfit. It never occurred to them that they could actual read to a civilian on the street as street thugs. To them, street thug means black person. It doesn't even occur to them, and it didn't occur to the news media at the time. He thought he was about to become the victim of a street crime, but they didn't see it that way. I think that if they had recognized him as an African, maybe they would have believed that an African would see a police officer as a thug. They wouldn't have seen him immediately as a threat that needed to be taken down with gunfire.\n\nYou were both talking about this critical distance needed to see racecraft: you can't pick something up when you're standing on it. What you identified racecraft as is ideology, which is a word that you use in the book in its Marxist rather than colloquial sense. Can you define ideology in the sense that you use it and explain how racecraft operates as an ideology?\n\nI can quote from the German Ideology or chapter one, section four of Capital , \"Socialism of Commodity and Secrets Thereof\" - read that and you see the man coming to grips with the transformation of an ordinary object into something else through the social process of trade. He says in that section in a hilarious way that according to ideology, the objects of trade are speaking to each other rather than passing each other as communication from the source of sender to the returner. It is a crowding of reality that you cannot see in the day-to-day process of whatever it is. It is not there to explain itself; it's there to operate on understandings of how it works that are already in place or trading would not be possible.\n\nWhen I talk to my students about this I turn it into a laughing matter. I say isn't it amusing that we speak of the economy as if it's a human being: it can be depressed just as a human being can be depressed. There is no such thing as the economy. It is the result of many millions of individual decisions that people make. We speak of it as the economy personified or reified precisely because we cannot get hold of all those individual actions, so we turn it into \"the economy.\"\n\nIf you have a village where the elders say to different families \"you grow this much grain you grow that much grain, you plant this field and you deal with that field.\" At harvest time, the elders say \"you get this much of the harvest because you have this size family, and you get a different part because you have another size.\" As a result, the entire product of all the work has been distributed among everybody. I tell the students no one in that society who was not a lunatic would say that these decisions are the product of the economy. They would all see that these are the decisions that the elders made.\n\nWe reify those decisions when we can't see where they come from. That is the way ideologies develop, because ideologies are the way of talking about the world as we experience it. Sometimes we experience the actual process of elders making decisions and sometimes we are seeing through a glass darkly, as St. Paul puts it. We cannot see what is actually going on, but we give a name to the result of what is going on and then we account for it in whatever rough and ready way we may have. That is my understanding of an ideology; it is not a scientific explanation; it is a rough-and-ready approximation.\n\nWhen you come up to a red light, you don't sit and ruminate on the philosophy about what you do at the intersection that is governed by a red light. We do have a reason why we stop for the red light, and there is an explanation that actually makes a lot of sense. The explanation is that everybody understands that regardless of our respect for the law or not, we need to know what everybody is doing at the intersection. We have lights there or stop signs or some other convention if there is nothing material like that, so that everybody knows what everybody will do at the intersection. When you are a teenager and your parents teach you how to drive, they will tell you what you are supposed to do at a four way or at a red light or at a flashing yellow and so on. That is an approximation of an ideology; it is what you need to know to get through the day.\n\nIt need not be demonstrable by thought process outside of the context in which it is being discussed.\n\nYou don't have to know who designed the first traffic light. You have a habit of doing a certain thing when you come to the light. You have an explanation that is good enough for why you need to do it. Not only it is not scientific, but it cannot be too detailed in how it gets to grips with the underlying reality. Otherwise you are in the situation of the mythical millipede who was asked how in the world he can walk with all those legs, and as soon as he stopped to think about he couldn't walk anymore. Ideology allows us to walk with a thousand legs and not think about it because if we think about, we can't do it.\n\nWith regard to racecraft as an ideology, would you agree with Stuart Hall's formulation that race is the modality in which class is lived, where class is experienced and fought out?\n\nIn this country, that's as good a statement as any because people weren't a race by virtue of being Africans in European society, but they became that after they arrived. In the United States, they were incorporated into a society where people could take freedom for granted: in other words, it was not a society premised on the normality of slavery. Slavery was normal and became even more normal in part of the country. In the country as a whole, it had been present from the beginning. All thirteen colonies had slavery at the time of the Declaration of Independence. Shortly thereafter, most of them either abolished it or began the process of abolishing it. So enslavement became a sufficiently anomalous situation that it had to be accounted for, but ideologically.\n\nThis isn't science, though it could be couched as science in this era when people began to speak this way. It is really ideological. It's that there is something different from people of African descent that defines this anomalous situation that they occupy in a country where freedom is to be taken for granted. My argument is that the next step, emancipation , deposits the former slaves for the most part into another social category that is not accepted as a basis for citizenship. Now they are proletarians, they are working people . There were white people in that status, but it still was not accepted. The idea was that one day you are going to have property and power. Abraham Lincoln said that there was no such thing of having to be a hireling laborer all his life. It wasn't yet accepted that being dependent on working for something else could be a status for a citizen. Yet most of the black slaves were released into this category. Therefore, their class position is the way they are defined as a race. It was when they were slaves, because this was an anomalous category. \" Working people \" was their categorization as freed former slaves. Both of those are class positions that come to define a racial position. If that is the point that Stuart Hall was making, than I think he had an insight that was correct for the American situation.\n\nToday, how do race and racism continue to reproduce and justify the political-economic order?\n\nLet me recommend the work of Adolph Reed , as well as Cedric Johnson. Despite what a good many of what the race-first people say, a number of Afro-Americans are part of the bourgeoisie , not the black bourgeoisie. When Franklin Frazier used the term , he was talking sarcastically about people who were not bourgeoisie, but petty bourgeois. We have a lot - not a lot statistically, but there are a number - of Afro-Americans who are in fact incorporated into the bourgeoisie, but most are working people and are at the hazard of whatever happens to working people. They are working people but in the parlance of American discourse don't get to be working people because that's reserved for white people. We have a whole part of the American working class that the scribbling classes don't consider part of the working class.\n\nThat brings up an issue that you both said you didn't want to discuss, but your analysis would provide interesting insight: why Rachel Dolezal identifying as black even though she was actually \"white\" so infuriated people on the Left, and delighted those on the Right.\n\nI wasn't aware of people on anything that I would call the Left being infuriated by it. My reaction was: why would someone need to put up a pretense? The history of agitation on behalf of the rights of black people on is not based on identifying yourself as a black person. The NAACP had white leaders before it had a black leader.\n\nIts first black leader was a white man. He opens his speech by saying \"I am a Negro, my skin is white, my hair is blond, my eyes are blue, but I am a Negro.\" He was the first black or rather Negro head of the NAACP: Walter White .\n\nYes, A Man Called White was the name of his book. Part of his effectiveness was that he could go and investigate lynchings in the South because he could mingle without people knowing that he was a Negro. He recounted an episode on a train about a group of white people on the train talking what they would do if they could get their hands on this Walter White character, this Negro from the NAACP. They didn't know he was right there.\n\nIn Dolezal's case I wonder why people were so upset about the unusual situation of a white woman passing as Black and being exposed. Why was this oddity that turned the historical pattern on its head so troubling to people?\n\nI said all that to say that it didn't trouble me except that I thought: who cares? There are more important things going on. I didn't understand why she needed to pose as anything. She could be the leader of the NAACP as a white woman. I don't understand why anyone would be upset by this except for the fact that it was a stupid episode that was treated as if it was something that was of major importance. That's why we shot it down. We are tired of people talking about racial identification as if that is the issue. It is not the issue. Whether somebody calls themselves white or black isn't something that we need to focus on. You can understand why the media likes that for the same reason they like stories about a white woman who gives birth to twins and one of them is dark skinned and one of them is white. I know they are going to go nuts with the woman who is going to marry the Duke or the Prince of whatever it is in Britain.\n\nFor many it is an issue of justice that Dolezal passing as black is - people would use this language - doing some sort of violence to black people.\n\nThe category I would put it in would also include the people who get angry that a white woman wears her hair in cornrows. It's the same kind of anger you are talking about. I call it adolescent behavior by people who can't think of anything more important to do.\n\nI think that's precisely it. It's a way of talking about certain things.\n\nAnd to not talk about the real thing.\n\nIt's analytically important to identify the way that racism has different impacts on different groups of people within capitalism. You make a very important point about the exclusive focus in certain quarters on racial disparity. By implication it proposes that once the working class, ruling class, and poor are demographically representative, then everything will be great. You write of people whose most radical goal is the reallocation of unemployment, poverty, and injustice, rather than their abolition. Tell me about the focus on racial disparity: for someone who believes that it needs to play some role in the analysis, what role if any do you think it should play in a left-wing critique of the economic order?\n\nEveryone must know that it exists as a well-documented fact. That fact will not carry a lot of water elsewhere. It does matter when you are making a claim to an action to affect North Carolina's allocation of funds for the support of agriculture, when they lost out as they did on exports. It is important to speak of facts, but speaking of facts is not a politics or a guide to policy. You must use the facts.\n\nYou need to know what you are going to do with it. If we know that agricultural workers working for the big growers: they are not farmers, they are growers. We know that people who work in those fields are subjected to pesticides as well as all kinds of substandard conditions. If you turn that into an issue having to do with the identities of people of color, then you have let the agribusiness farmers off the hook. We know why they take advantage of the workforce that has to approach the pesticides and work without proper sanitary conditions. It is not because they have anything in their hearts about so-called people of color. It is because they are getting their work done in the cheapest way they can. They don't care about which people they are exploiting to do that.\n\nVann Woodward has a moment in Origins of The New South where he talks about the publicity of poor white people in the South , and how they were marketed to would-be investors from the outside because they are not amenable to unionization and will accept low wages and so on. The prospectus they were selling to people was \"here are people out of history and out of time with an Elizabethan flavor.\" When they were selling the workforce they didn't distinguish that much the color of the wares. The people who are buying don't care. They care what they are going to pay people.\n\nThis is the asymmetry of it. The people who are the engine of this kind of exploitation - whatever they may say - have their eyes on the prize. We who are trying to dismantle it take our eyes of their prize all the time. We allow ourselves to be carried off into conversations about racial disparities this or racial identities that. When you mentioned racial disparities I thought of one of Adolph Reed's article when he quotes an item that appeared in the the Onion. It just said these people are \"the most likely.\" It didn't have a predicate, just the most likely. It was a comment on the disparity argument and that was the context that Reed talked about it. I do think of it as a rope-a-dope strategy. You get people focused on something that is not really essential, and you let others off the hook.\n\nRacism not only legitimates a class project, but also obscures it. It obscures people's ability to see the class project underway. You point to the reception of the Bell Curve . They are neo-eugenicists, and racists no doubt, but you write that the focus on racism at the exclusion of all else misses that their overall argument was about the degeneracy of poor people as a whole.\n\nThey were justifying class inequality. We recently had another go around here at Columbia, because Charles Murray had been invited to speak. I doubt most of the good-hearted students who wanted to agitate against it and faculty supporting them had read the book. Certainly, they had no clue about the class dimension of it because all they knew was that they had heard that he was a racist.\n\nThat was how they marketed the book at Free Press.\n\nYes, that's the photogenic part of the argument. The part of the argument that is not photogenic is that working-class white people are where they are because they are not very smart, because they are backward.\n\nThat was the entire focus of his book, Coming Apart . It is about reaching the degenerate white working-class people of Philadelphia.\n\nWhen the well-meaning progressives here wanted to agitate against it, that wasn't what they picked. Here they are in what they think of as a \"Trump moment,\" with the perfect opportunity to draw attention to a very explicit class project, but they let it slip because calling him a racist and talking about what he says about black people is going to generate more favorable publicity from their standpoint. It will get the choir on its feet, and they are not talking to anyone else.\n\nThe race project is one that Hillary Clinton could condemn, but the class project is one that she wouldn't and couldn't.\n\nShe is all for it. In a sense, that is what Obama was about. That is why the bankers who came as close as possible to destroying the economy were bailed out and not held accountable for what they had done. That wasn't part of the program. You can't wonder why it is that the people who suffered in all of that, who bought subprime mortgages - and I'm talking about the white people not just the black people - were sour at the end of the day. They thought that we are here holding the can, and the people who did this were not held to account. Where do we go for someone that understands our situation? Well, you don't go to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere was a persistent critique in certain quarters of the Hillary-friendly liberal media that Bernie's emphasis on class politics necessarily meant he wasn't paying enough attention to racial justice.\n\nSuch a lie.\n\nI heard those criticisms, then I would see videos of Sanders rallies and there was always a healthy representation of Black Lives Matter there. A lot of the young people could see through Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe polls make it clear that young people of all sorts backed Bernie over Clinton. It reminds me though; I did want to ask you what role racial identification can have for black people fighting for freedom who have had these categories imposed on them? If blackness is a category imposed on black people by racecraft and racism, is it possible for people to have a collective racial \"we\" in fighting against racism without falling into the trap of essentializing race? I'm thinking particularly of this at a time when many young people are mobilizing under the banner of Black Lives Matter (BLM), which has that racial category right in its first word.\n\nI'm not sure it's a racial category, although it certainly is a category that draws attention to racism. That confusion of race and racism is one of the things that we try to highlight in Racecraft . Over the years, Americans of African descent have had numerous ways of referring to themselves as a people, because they have been a people and have been made a people through the conditions they were faced. Whether those conditions were slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, disenfranchisement, job discrimination, or whatever it was, they faced common circumstances that made them recognize themselves as a people.\n\nEvery time they designated themselves as a people, that became a racial designation. When colored as a term was replaced by Negro and Negro was replaced by Black, every one of those was a way of defining a people. When it gets into the general vocabulary, it became a racial designation. When Black Lives Matter activists say black lives matter, they are not making a racial statement .\n\nCouching it that way, I have to say this though: the slogan \"black lives matter\" disturbs me mainly because it seems too self-effacing. Having to declare that \"black lives matter\" is making too large a concession to the enemy. It reminds me of perhaps the most famous Frederic Douglass oration: his Fourth of July address that he delivered in Rochester in the 1850s. He was brought there by abolitionists. He said, \"I don't know what you want me to say, you don't need me. We are celebrating the anniversary of the birth of the Republic. You don't need me to tell you slavery is wrong. I don't need to say that to Republicans. You don't need me to tell you that slaves are human beings - even the slave-owners know that. If they didn't, then they would not have so many provisions in their legal codes that define acts committed by slaves as crimes. A mule can't commit a crime. A wagon cannot commit a crime.\" He built the whole rhetorical structure on \"I don't need to tell you people these things because you know them. You are Republicans, you are Abolitionists, and so you know all these things.\"\n\nI think about that when I think about young people having to say, \"black lives matter.\" Do Americans have to say that other Americans, and for that matter, other human beings' lives matter? To have to say, \"black lives matter,\" and open yourself up to an enemy who tries to trump that with \"all lives matter,\" when in fact the slogan BLM always meant all lives matter. It was a way of saying, \"yes, ours too.\" I don't like the way they had to say ours too as though there could be a question about whether ours matter, because everybody's matters.\n\nIt seems like the two of you would prefer Freedom Now or something of that sort.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah, but I don't think either of us is criticizing the young people who did that because they responded to a moment in which much of this history has been lost, including \"Freedom Now\" and Frederick Douglas. They are having to build the world anew. It is a commentary on us that we are requiring our young people to build the world anew, that they don't have something to build on. This is because of a long demobilization and a purging a persecution that has left us without a political heritage on which to build. So everybody has to start again from the beginning and each time we do that we have lost momentum and ground. There may not be an alternative to doing it. You can't fabricate a historical knowledge that isn't there. Having to operate without a historical knowledge means that you are operating with one hand behind your back, so I am delighted that we have an opportunity to remind people that in 1963, the slogan was Jobs and Freedom. In other words, everybody understood how one thing was related to the others.\n\nPerhaps we should prepare broadcasts of those speeches to enrich the arguments that people are making as they attempt to resist and formulate what resistance should be made up of.\n\nRemember when that young white man whose name I cannot remember was shot in South Carolina?\n\nIn the marijuana bust where he was trying to drive away and they shot him to death?\n\nThe point is: in Seneca, South Carolina, there was a white man killed by the police. The only way that episode was publicized was because some of the Black Lives Matter people put it on Twitter and it was picked up by the media. That was how it came to public knowledge. I'm saying that to illustrate that black lives matter always meant that all lives matter. It's just that the young people who were saying that thought that others need to be told \"Ours too.\"\n\nThey did not forget that all lives matter. They didn't get very far because as it happens, the white neighbors of the family whose son was killed didn't stand up for the family. They couldn't figure out a safe place to put their feet in what looked like quicksand. They probably assumed that in these confrontations, the police are the good guys and whoever is on the other side are the bad guys. Racecraft would allow themselves to make that assumption when the person on the other side was black. Here is a white person that they know in small-town Carolina, but they cannot allow themselves to call it what it is because it's out of the pattern and they don't have a way to understand that. If all lives matter were a serious declaration rather than just a way of hitting BLM people, then the all lives matter people would have jumped on it, but they didn't, did they?\n\nHow could they make sense of this white young man being treated the way they thought black men deserved?\n\nThis is a function of the stuff that I was talking about earlier. He must have done something to deserve this. It's not his black color, but whatever he did must have been Negro-like to have that consequence. I'd like to walk through and ask people why they think this all happened.\n\nThe way that racism functions is to legitimate policies that harm working-class people as a whole by spectacularly harming black people and Hispanic people more. You have mass incarceration which justifies itself by disproportionately locking up so many black people but also locks up an extraordinary number of white people. The same with welfare reform : because welfare was disproportionately received by black mothers, the Clinton administration was allowed to end welfare for all mothers.\n\nYou can go back further to disenfranchisement in the South during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, which was supposed to be the disenfranchisement of Afro-Americans but ended up disenfranchising large numbers of white people. It was the beginning of the low voter turnout that continues to be part of American political society. The difference between that time and our moment is that the white people who became the targets were not fooled by it. They knew what was going on. Today, it may be that people aren't aware. It can be successfully hidden that this weapon wielded against black people can be wielded against you as well.\n\nIn your book, you write that the debacle of the bankers talking about the financial crisis rubbed the gloss from the justifications of inequality that prevailed since the 1980s. The welfare mother can no longer stand for what is not right in America. All these horrible things that have happened have been justified via racism, and obviously with Trump in office , racism is a real part of elite class warfare in this country. Since 2008, we've seen Bernie, Occupy, and Black Lives Matter: do you see people getting that critical distance from racecraft that you have been talking about, and being able to take collective action against this system that has done so much harm in this country and all over the world?\n\nWe hoped to put some ammunition in the hands of people who were trying to fight the most recent wave of capitalist oppression because we recognized how useful the race card had been. So we said that one of the things to do is to get this information that we have out because we need to be able to hear each other as Americans, and not this nonsense that we hear about racial identity today. Racecraft provides an explanation for the bad that happens to black people, and it is a rope-a-dope for people who might otherwise put their fists into people who are exporting their jobs abroad.\n\nPart of the present moment is that we are seeing a program, even if it has been slowed down, a program as part of the right-wing Republicans and the Trump people - they are an ox team not always pulling in the same direction, but they do have in common a class program even if they are sometimes representing different parts of the class that is on top. In many ways, they are building momentum because they are changing the nature of the game. They don't expect to have to pay for what they are going to do to a good number of working because they are working on ways to curate the electorate, to prevent people from voting and prevent people's votes from counting. It's easier to buy a state legislature than to buy the US Congress, but these people can do both. They are establishing a momentum that is quite frightening by which they hope to insulate themselves from being punished by the people they injure. They may imagine that there isn't much that black people can do about it.\n\nExcept that black people will be punished for their injury. Blame will be shifted into stories about welfare again. The welfare mother stories came back when this process happened in the 1980s.\n\nIt's true of many classes with overweening projects of power that they don't see their opponents clearly. So they may not always be aware of what they are unleashing. While they are confident that they can handle anything that's going to occur because of the racism and homophobia and all the other ways that they provide fuel for anyone that wants to blow up the social structure, I don't think they truly realize what it will be if they unleash a white population that is both angry and hopeless. If they imagine that it will all be directed against scapegoats, maybe that's because they don't know what happens when no holds are barred and all limits are off.\n\nWhat are the openings and challenges for the Left in this moment of incredible uncertainty?\n\nI don't know if it is an opening because too many progressives are not thinking about these things in class terms. So what opening is there for them if their only answer to a general souring of working people with good reason is to say so and so black people and racism so and so and so Hispanics so and so and so gay marriage? They have a map with all different pieces, but it almost seems as if they are not aware that their map comes from an era that the enemy has superseded. It's just not working the same way. I watch the Democrats in Congress and there is something almost laughable about watching Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer when they lumber into action with something that is a day late and a dollar short. An opening depends on someone capable of spotting it and exploiting it.\n\nThat was Bernie Sanders, don't you think?\n\nSometimes, the Bernie Sanders people are also the progressives who feel defensive about it and think they should do some of that. It's deadly. What stood out about Sanders was that he found a way to talk about the overall inequality and injustice without trying to speak to individual designated portions of the populace as though they were separate entities. I don't want to lose that. That was a grace that this country was offered without deserving it. I blame the Democrats mainly for it because they decided they rather keep their apparatus and apparatchiks who benefit from this. They were threatened by someone who could leapfrog there.\n\nAn incorruptible.\n\nThey threw away a grace we were given, and so we got instead Donald Trump and his people. I don't just mean the people around him, but the billionaires who have come into their own. They have a way of multiplying their power so it keeps going up exponentially. That's what having that level of money and that type of power is going to do. It goes back to what Thomas Jefferson warned about in the constitution of the state of Virginia and the need to guard against corruption. He said we need to nip it in the bud before we have so many people holding so much power that we can't fix it anymore. He said the trouble is that the objects of this kind of power are also the engines of it. With men, we will get money; with money, we will get men: it turns around in an expanding circle. It gets bigger as it goes along. It feeds on what it is seeking.\n\nPeople remember that he was a slaveholder, and he did all he could do to keep the Haitian Revolution from spreading. He and his fellow slaveholder James Madison understood how power works. While we dismiss the other things they bequeathed us, we need to remember the other things we have forgotten. When Ronald Reagan was elected, I was working at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. I ran into Henry Fairly, to my mind a big-mouthed conservative Brit who worked for the Washington Post , and here he is telling Americans how to organize our society. I said to him \"at this moment there is only one politician that I have any faith in and that is James Madison, I hope that he has made this machinery sufficiently unworkable that these guys can't do what they want to do.\" Apparently, it was not unworkable enough. Reagan may not have been able to do everything he wanted to do or those who came after him, but the machinery has not been unworkable enough to stop this onslaught.\n\nWe have all the historical precedents to tell us how deadly the bourgeoisie is if they ever think their backs are against the wall. I remember somebody making a warning like that after the coup in Chile . One thing this teaches us is how bloodthirsty the bourgeoisie are if we even look like we are mounting an effective opposition, but that's what it is.\n\nIf Sanders represented unearned grace, the take-home message is that we can only be saved by works, not grace.\n\nEven if our work is our work of accepting grace. Work is what is required, but it has to be work informed by knowledge and understanding.\n\nBarbara J. Fields teaches history at Columbia University.

If the latter is used to challenge the status quo, it could effectively push back on MAGA-style manhood.\n\nDemocratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz attends the Minnesota State Fair on September 1, 2024, in Falcon Heights, Minnesota.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt's been conventional wisdom that younger generations emerge more progressive than their predecessors. \"The young people will save us,\" has been a sentiment often shared by elders, albeit problematically, as they've watched new movements build power. But this summer, we've reached a breaking point: that is not true anymore for Gen Z men.\n\nMAGA has captured older men, especially older white men: according to recent polling data, about half of its movement is over the age of sixty-five, and more than 60 percent is white, Christian, and male. More surprising is the stark gender divide that has emerged among American youth: over the past twenty-five years, the partisan gap between young women and young men has nearly doubled, and Gen Z women are today a whopping twenty-three points more liberal than their generation's men. It's a regressive trend, with Gen Z men proving to be more conservative than millennial men.\n\nIt's also an apparently rapid trend, at least when it comes to Gen Z men's views on gender: 49 percent of Gen Z men said the United States had become \"too soft and feminine\" in 2022; just one year later, that number jumped to 60 percent. And all of these trends are only exacerbated when lasering in on white Gen Z men in particular.\n\nSome of this political divide is attributable to the growing popularity of cultural figures such as Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate. The \"manosphere\" targets young men struggling with the emotional and psychological impacts of contemporary American culture - changing social norms surrounding identity and purpose, for example - and promotes a particularly noxious and regressive form of masculinity. At the same time, and with great success, manosphere influencers weaponize the popularity of the term \"toxic masculinity\" as an example of how men are actually victims of a changing society that wants to malign them, sideline them, and replace them.\n\nThese guys - Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate, and their contemporaries - aren't simply capitalizing on male anger. That undersells their strategic approach and wide appeal . They leverage the power of wellness and self-help rhetoric in a society that purports to be a meritocracy. And they offer clear answers to some of the most profound questions we all grapple with: Who am I? What is my purpose in this life? What is my role? What gives life meaning?\n\nThe answers the manosphere provides to these questions are, of course, wrong . But they're clear answers nonetheless, and answers that have cross-race appeal; their message resonates with white and non-white men alike.\n\nWith the ascension of J. D. Vance as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, the worldview of the \"manosphere\" has gone from a fringe part of internet culture to the top of national politics. Vance opposes gay marriage, abortion, in vitro fertilization, and no-fault divorce. Synergy between the cultural on-ramps to reactionary gender politics, Republican leadership championing that worldview, and a thriving right-wing movement where men find belonging means that it's more important than ever to present an alternative, healthy representation of masculinity - in general, but perhaps especially for the millions of working-class white men who are, according to data , a key demographic of the far-right movement.\n\nConversations about masculinity on the Left often end up playing into the reactionary power of the manosphere by focusing on rebutting what we find problematic : we tell men what not to do, who not to be, how not to act. And delivering on economic policy wins, while essential, is not enough to combat the way the Right takes advantage of the perceived status threats, feelings of disrespect by cultural elites, racial animus, growing unhappiness, and worsening economic reality of working-class white men in particular.\n\nRightful critiques of masculinity are incomplete without an affirmative vision of our own to offer. Whether we like it or not, most people yearn for a clear sense of meaning and purpose in life, particularly in an era marked by rapid social, political, and economic change. And the reality is that for most people, that sense of meaning or purpose will be mediated by identity, especially by gender and race.\n\nOne way we can affirmatively engage in this conversation is by uplifting depictions of manhood in mass culture that working-class white men find relatable and representative, but that promote healthier, more progressive social dynamics and ways of being. Also at the top of national politics, the \" tonic masculinity \" of Governor Tim Walz has gone viral as a refreshing example of this kind of progressive man.\n\nWalz moves through the world - in T-shirts, hunting camo , and the uncool kind of dad sneaker - exuding affable white guy, Midwest nice, football coach energy that has evidently resonated with tons of people. A big part of the appeal seems to come from the down-to-earth, average Joe , dad vibes he gives . As one person tweeted , there are \"a lot of us who hope our dad would have ended up a lot more like Tim Walz than JD Vance if it weren't for Fox News.\"\n\nWhite women in particular - probably because they are more likely to be close to men of their own race who make up the bulk of the MAGA movement - have reacted to Walz with a kind of longing; in TikToks and Twitter/X threads, they've bemoaned the radicalization of men and the impact it's had on relationships with their fathers, uncles, and brothers. Walz as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in an age when so many men have been \"red-pilled \" into reactionary politics - and with Vance as the other ticket's comparison - is a real opportunity for a different vision of masculinity to culturally take root.\n\nWalz shows how straight white men can embody and advocate for principles that hold deep cultural resonance in America, like \"family values\" and \"freedom.\" For example, when he talks about how he and his wife used intrauterine insemination (IUI) to conceive their children, how as a dad, \"I [shouldn't] have to go right back to work five days later, after my wife had a C-section,\" and how \"there's nothing pro-family [about the Right] other than having women be incubators for their vision,\" he articulates and demonstrates a fundamentally different version of family values, freedom, and fatherhood than the one the Right offers men.\n\nIn discussing police violence against black Americans, he once said that black youth \"[apparently all know . . . that the minute you're pulled over, you \"Hey Siri,\" so it notifies your parents where you're at and starts recording right away. My kids don't have to do that. They don't have to think about that. What a diminishment of life, if that's the first thing that's on your mind.\" That's a simple, digestible articulation of the horrors of racism, framed from the perspective of a loving father. He draws attention to racism without using language the Right has coded as \"woke,\" which often alienates average people; it can be a universal part of fatherhood, when conceived of this way, to want all kids to be able to live full lives free of fear.\n\nSimilarly, when he was a high school teacher and sponsored the school's first gay-straight alliance club, Walz demonstrated how straight, traditionally masculine men can use the privileges of their identity to advance the rights and recognition of a group with less political and social power.\n\nAll of this is more profoundly meaningful because Walz's economic record demonstrates something that I've described as \"structural kindness\": believing in the kind of systematic reforms, through policymaking and government action, that make the conditions of society easier for people en masse. This exists in contrast to the way that many people, conservative men in particular, demonstrate and flaunt interpersonal kindness - to their own families, children, wives, and daughters - while advancing policies that make conditions of society harder for women or families as a whole.\n\nWalz's record as governor is pro-worker, pro-labor, and therefore pro-family - in the structural sense, as well as the interpersonal and the rhetorical . As an example, facing criticism from the Right who called him a \"big-government liberal\" for providing free lunch to all schoolchildren in the state, Walz simply responded about himself : \"What a monster! Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn.\"\n\nIt is, of course, still unknown what the exact dynamics of federal economic policy will look like under a hypothetical Kamala Harris-Tim Walz administration. But Walz's record on this front is strong and hopefully will be a foundation of what the administration will push for federally.\n\nWe are also in the middle of another wave of youth organizing: young people on college campuses have played a leading role in protesting against the horror in Gaza. People who malign the protesters, or who have supported escalation against them, include many Democratic elected officials and liberal pundits . The wave of campus encampments of last spring could have offered an opportunity for a conversation about what students were getting right about inclusion: they were modeling democratic practices inside the encampments, often in communities that were racially, religiously, and gender diverse. Their organizing was not perfect, but they were trying their best - and succeeding in many ways - as they attempted to do the right thing in the face of unspeakable horror.\n\nThis week, when Walz was asked about how the Harris-Walz administration would handle the Israel-Hamas war, he said , referring to the Uncommitted movement, \"I think the people in Michigan are speaking out for all the right reasons.\" If he plays a leading role in shifting how leaders (including his own presidential ticket-mate) respond to the students too - an approach that understands and acknowledges the care, compassion, and kindness at the heart of their organizing - it can be yet another example of how a different approach to masculinity can be critical in the fight against authoritarianism here and abroad .\n\nAcross all these examples, the message should be simple: supporting other people's freedoms doesn't take away from your manhood. You can find profound purpose and meaning in your identity as a father, as a husband, as a man that isn't defined by subjugation, emotional distance, or suppression. It actually can be masculine to care about the well-being and dignity of other human beings.\n\nIt's not just that Walz is a \"nice guy\"; it's that he subverts the conception that reactionary political and cultural forces have established as what it means to be a rural white man. Celebrating these kinds of moments in mass culture is a way to say \"this is what we want more of\" without making men feel lectured to.\n\nCultural moments can help us provide a vision of healthier masculinity that feels relatable and real to people. Football coaching and hunting are things we code as traditionally masculine, ruggedly American. But that doesn't and shouldn't mean that the people enmeshed in these cultures are doomed to fall prey to reactionary politics. As people engaged in the political project of building a more progressive future, we should capitalize on these kinds of opportunities to broaden the base of people engaged in that project with us - or at the very least, try to prevent our opposition's base from expanding more than it already has.\n\nIt's worth noting the recent example of John Fetterman, who successfully campaigned for federal office as an internet darling and who has, in many ways, betrayed his base upon becoming a senator. In different ways, Fetterman also offered a version of white and supposedly working-class (though Fetterman himself comes from wealth) masculinity and online cultural relevance that rebuked authoritarianism. Walz is different - he has become more progressive over the course of his career . If that changes as vice president, it would be catastrophic to have yet another example of progressive masculinity that was ultimately a public relations campaign to maintain the status quo. The stakes are simply too high.\n\nAt this juncture, it's imperative that the Left offer its own script, one that speaks to people's identities as they exist in the here and now, allows for people's questions and discomfort without sacrificing our values or vision, and affirmatively advocates for a new social order characterized by equity, inclusivity, and justice. That script may remain largely unwritten at the moment, but it will include camo hats, hunting, and, hopefully, kindness in policymaking.\n\nKatie Kirchner is the vice president of field-building programs at Roosevelt Forward.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFerguson Police officer Darren Wilson spent more than one hundred days in hiding while a grand jury decided whether or not to indict him on any charge related to the killing of black teenager Mike Brown. After a long and blustering speech in defense of the indefensible, Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch announced Monday there would be no indictment.\n\nThe decision not to indict wasn't surprising, but its predictability did very little to disperse the anger and frustration that has become part of the ritual of grieving the loss of another young African American at the hands of American law enforcement. There can be no question that black life is both cheap and expendable in the eyes of law enforcement and the criminal justice system of which it is a part.\n\nAnd yet there is a stubborn refusal to have this conversation as the starting point for any meaningful change in the practice of law enforcement in this country. Instead, the mainstream media and even the president remain almost singularly focused on the potential of violence among anti-police brutality activists, particularly in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nOver the last several weeks, law enforcement and the media worked in tandem to whip up hysteria about violent demonstrations in the aftermath of the predictable decision not to indict.\n\nFor months, one thousand officers around St. Louis were preparing for these demonstrations. The FBI released a memo to local law enforcement agencies warning of \"outside agitators\" and violent Ferguson solidarity protests. The Boston Public Schools even did robocalls calling for \"peaceful\" demonstrations in the aftermath of a grand jury decision. In the media coverage of the reaction to the decision, reporters donned gas masks, trained their cameras on burning objects, and integrated themselves and their personal safety into the evening's news.\n\nBut in all of the hysterical reporting about violent demonstrations, there was almost no discussion about what would prompt such an angry reaction to a grand jury decision. There was no discussion about the police violence, harassment, and yes, terrorism that pervades black and brown communities in every city and state in this country.\n\nInstead, President Barack Obama offered the hollow observation, \"We have made enormous progress in race relations over the course of the past several decades.\" That progress is decidedly difficult to measure given the persistence of police murders of African Americans.\n\nJust in the days prior to the grand jury decision, police in Cleveland killed an unarmed African-American woman, Tanisha Anderson, by smashing her head into the concrete. Then, 12-year-old Tamir Rice, also of Cleveland, was shot in the stomach twice by white cops and killed. He was holding an air pellet gun on a playground. African-American Akai Gurley was murdered by New York City cops when he entered the stairwell of a public housing complex.\n\nThese cases only scratch the surface of the scope of racist policing in the US, but it is the subject of almost no discussion outside of radical circles.\n\nWhite cops are twenty-one times more likely to shoot a black man than a white man. And more African-American police will not help. Black cops are involved in only 10 percent of police shootings, but 78 percent of the victims they shoot are African American.\n\nThe FBI calculated that from 2007 to 2012, white police killed at least two black men each week - roughly five hundred deaths in all. To put this in perspective, consider that in the five years prior to the introduction of federal anti-lynching legislation in 1922, there were 284 lynchings of African Americans. The epidemic of racism is raging through every institution connected to the American criminal justice system.\n\nPolice violence is only one aspect of a generally racist criminal justice system that feeds off the bodies of black people. Enormous numbers of African Americans have been victimized by the \"war on drugs\" that has resulted in the literal criminalization of African American communities. To take only one statistic illustrating the disparities, African Americans are 13 percent of drug users - roughly the same as their proportion in the population as a whole - but are 46 percent of those convicted for drug offenses.\n\nThe foot soldiers in the war on drugs are the cops on the beat, who target black communities to make the easy arrests increasingly demanded by municipal officials, who crave them as proof that they are fighting crime. And there is the other motive - in Ferguson, municipal court fines, mainly from vehicle violations, are the second largest source of income for the city.\n\nReading Darren Wilson's testimony describing Mike Brown in the released grand jury transcripts , one can glean how entrenched police racism is.\n\nIt is, in fact, the racist dehumanization of Brown that holds Wilson's story together. The only way to believe Darren Wilson is to suspend belief in Brown's humanity, his literal humanness. In Wilson's testimony, Brown becomes a wild animal - or a \"demon,\" as the officer refers to Brown - who tossed Wilson around like a rag doll, \"grunted aggressively,\" was impervious to gunshot wounds, and only stopped when he was shot in the head.\n\nThe universality of police racism has prompted thousands of people across the country to organize and attend rallies in solidarity with Mike Brown, his family, and Ferguson. There is a recognition that we owe a tremendous debt to the people of Ferguson, who have refused to stop organizing and kept the campaign against this injustice alive. In doing so, they have given new life to a growing movement against racist policing and the criminal injustice system.\n\nThe movement in Ferguson has built on a movement that has roots in the organizing to stop the execution of black death row prisoner Troy Davis in Georgia in the fall of 2011. It certainly grows out of the activism that helped get George Zimmerman arrested for the murder of Trayvon Martin, and that re-emerged after Zimmerman was acquitted.\n\nThe movement is represented by a core of young organizers from a variety of groups, including Hands Up United, Organization for Black Struggle, We Charge Genocide, Black Lives Matter, Don't Shoot Coalition, Millennial Activists United, Black Youth Project, and beyond.\n\nThrough activism, this layer of developing leaders has helped to clarify that the much-discussed \"divide\" in black America is about politics much more than simply generation.\n\nIt will be lost on few people that the same mainstream black leaders, who earlier in November were lecturing African Americans about turning out to vote for Democratic candidates who have had precious little to say about the issues impacting black communities, now have little to say themselves about how to respond to Ferguson.\n\nNot only did no prominent black elected official come out against the mobilization of the National Guard and obvious attempts to intimidate protestors in Ferguson, but very few called for concrete policies aimed at reigning in racist policing in black communities.\n\nOf course, to do so would call into question many other practices in black communities right now. Racist policing isn't happening in a vacuum - it has to be seen, at least in part, as the flip side of the economic gutting of those communities.\n\nThe local, state, and federal governments have slowly eroded black neighborhoods by shuttering public schools and public housing, closing public clinics and hospitals, and slashing funding for social programs. They have stood by while the foreclosure crisis gave way to an eviction crisis.\n\nThey advocated the destruction of public-sector jobs that have been a source of middle-level incomes for African Americans, and instead championed low-wage underemployment. Plus, the mass incarceration of hundreds of thousands of black men and women has left them unable to participate in the job market - or if so, only at its margins.\n\nAll told, these factors combine to make black communities vulnerable to policing that has already criminalized and impoverished African Americans. These policing practices have, in effect, become a form of public policy, which complicates what politicians suggest as remedies. In fact, they have very few remedies to offer beyond studies, investigations, and vague calls for justice.\n\nBut there are very clear demands our movement can put on the table to increase the pressure on equivocating political leaders who support law enforcement and subscribe to the idea that the problem is a \"few bad apples,\" rather than policing being systemically racist.\n\nWe should demand civilian review boards that reflect the composition of the communities where police are accused of wrongdoing. We can demand a federal law against racial profiling. We can demand that police accused of abuse and murder actually be arrested and put through a legal process, as any other person would be subjected to. Finally - and this is by no means an exhaustive list - we should demand that police forces across the country be disarmed.\n\nThere is an epidemic of police shooting unarmed African Americans, and it is intensifying. In Utah, police are responsible for a shocking 15 percent of all homicides in the state. The Ferguson grand jury decision to not indict Darren Wilson will give cover to police across the country to continue killing unarmed African Americans - unless we take the guns out of their hands.\n\nThe murder of Mike Brown has created a new urgency to build this movement. It's clear that nothing other than a mass movement can stop the senseless murder of young African Americans at the hands of American police.\n\nKeeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is an assistant professor in Princeton University's Department of African American Studies.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Civil rights organizers have historically considered this an asset and often used it creatively and strategically to their advantage, as they did during the Freedom Rides through the American South in 1961.\n\nThe military guard a bus en route from Montgomery, Alabama, as the Freedom Riders head for Jackson, Mississippi, on May 26 1961.

They have also leveled a system-wide demand to defund the police .\n\nThe protests have emerged in in more American cities and towns than any protest movement in our nation's history. A striking feature of the movement is its highly multiracial character. Approached strategically, this can be a key strength. One of the lessons of the twentieth-century struggle for civil rights is that a multiracial activist base can be a major asset.\n\nFor a creative and successful example of multiracial anti-racist activism, look no further than the Freedom Rides that challenged segregated bus travel in the Jim Crow South.\n\nThe Freedom Rides of 1961 were an echo of an earlier organizing strategy known as the Journey of Reconciliation. In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated seating on interstate bus routes was illegal. But anti-segregation organizers knew better than to prematurely celebrate. Just because something was technically illegal in the United States didn't mean it wouldn't be practiced in the Jim Crow South. It remained to be seen whether the law of the land would be enforced.\n\nThe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) was then a fledgling group that believed the principles of Gandhian nonviolent direct action could be applied to the struggle for racial equality in the United States. But as Mike Davis and Jon Wiener observe in Set the Night on Fire: L.A. in the Sixties , CORE's \"methodology - sit-ins, jail-ins, wade-ins, boycotts - derived as much from the IWW and the CIO as it did from the Indian freedom movement.\"\n\nOne of CORE's most striking characteristics at the time was that it was a highly multiracial group, boasting black leadership but more white members than black members from the outset. CORE regarded this multiracial character as an asset, not a liability. (This would change a few years later in 1966, when CORE shifted in a more black nationalist direction.)\n\nAfter the Supreme Court decision came down, the organization decided to make the most of its multiracial activist base. Under the leadership of black organizer Bayard Rustin and white organizer George Houser, CORE and the Fellowship of Reconciliation decided to send eight white men and eight black men on two interstate bus journeys into the South. The idea was that the black men would sit in the front of the buses (they bought tickets on Greyhound and Trailways), while the white men sat in the back. Or, sometimes, the white and black men would occupy rows together.\n\nThe participants in this action, called the Journey of Reconciliation, fully expected to be ordered to resegregate, planned to peacefully resist, and anticipated that they would become targets of violence. The risk was worth it to them to expose the lack of enforcement of desegregation, which they felt was necessary to advance the struggle for civil rights.\n\nThey left from Washington, DC, on April 9, 1947. Unsurprisingly, they ran into trouble further south of the Mason-Dixon line. After a few earlier conflicts, four participants were arrested in North Carolina - two black men (including Rustin) for refusing to change seats, and two white men for defending them. One of the white men was beaten by an angry white spectator as he was hauled off the bus by police.\n\nThe Journey of Reconciliation continued after that. Conflicts with police continued. The riders also took the opportunity to meet with students, clergy, and other supporters of civil rights on their travels. But their troubles didn't end when they returned to DC. The following year, they were ordered before a judge in North Carolina, where they had been arrested, and were sentenced to twenty-two days of hard labor on racially segregated chain gangs .\n\nThe Journey of Reconciliation didn't make that many headlines, but it was discussed at length in the black press, drumming up enthusiasm for civil rights and helping recruit new activists to the struggle. In time, the creativity and dauntlessness of the participants served as an inspiration for the Montgomery Bus Boycott and eventually the Freedom Rides.\n\nA great deal transpired between the Journey of Reconciliation and the Freedom Rides. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman ended segregation in the armed forces. In 1954, the Supreme Court decided in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation was no longer legal in public schools. The year-long 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott was followed by the 1957 creation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, presided over by Martin Luther King, Jr. Over the course of the decade, the civil rights struggle evolved into what is formally taught in schools as the civil rights movement.\n\nJust as in 1947, enforcement of federal law in the South continued to be a major obstacle to movement victories. Brown v. Board of Education may have technically desegregated schools three years earlier, but the Arkansas National Guard still blocked the Little Rock Nine from entering the schoolhouse in 1957. Activists hoped to draw attention to the lack of enforcement in order to challenge it, but while the Little Rock Nine case had garnered national headlines, the nation's attention drifted away from the issue in the years that followed.\n\nBy 1961, after John F. Kennedy's inauguration, movement leaders feared that civil rights and equality for black people were slipping from view, and that the movement, despite receiving a jolt of energy through the recent formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), was in danger of losing steam. Leaders felt they needed to carry out a symbolically powerful action to force the issue back onto the agenda.\n\nJames Farmer, CORE's national director, proposed a repeat of the 1947 strategy, which would be called the Freedom Ride. Civil rights leaders, including King, approved of the idea. Davis and Wiener write:\n\nIn a situation where the law was now crystal clear but its application was bound to elicit violent reactions in hardcore segregationist states, Farmer calculated that Washington would be forced to act. The Ride would help sustain the energy of the student movement while redirecting it to a higher level of contestation involving governors and federal officials, as well as mayors and local businesses. Everything, however, depended on the volunteers' willingness to risk their lives by riding into the heart of segregationist darkness.\n\nThe Journey of Reconciliation had stopped and turned around in North Carolina, after finding plenty of trouble from racists. The thirteen participants in the Freedom Ride, however, were bound by bus for New Orleans through Alabama and Mississippi. Again, the group was multiracial - seven black, six white, all recruited and trained by CORE staff - and this was part of its design.\n\nStokely Carmichael of SNCC said of the plan :\n\nThe plan . . . was simplicity itself. In any sane, even half-civilized society it would have been completely innocuous, hardly worth a second thought or meriting any comment at all. CORE would be sending an integrated team - black and white together - from the nation's capital to New Orleans on public transportation. That's all. Except, of course, they would sit randomly on the buses in integrated pairs and in the stations they would use the waiting room facilities casually, ignoring the white/colored signs. What could be more harmless . . . in any marginally healthy society?\"\n\nThe group left DC on May 4. In the weeks that followed, they faced attacks and arrests similar to those experienced by the Journey of Reconciliation participants all through North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi. But that was nothing compared to what was waiting for them in Alabama.\n\nThe Alabama Knights of the Ku Klux Klan were acutely aware of the riders' movements. They'd heard about the Freedom Ride before it began, despite it garnering little attention in the press. This was because the Birmingham Police were simultaneously working with the FBI and had strong connections to the Klan. In his history, Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice , Raymond Arsenault writes:\n\nThe Klansmen had known about the Freedom Ride since mid-April, thanks to a series of FBI memos forwarded to the Birmingham Police Department. Police sergeant Tim Cook - an avid Klan supporter and anti-Communist zealot who worked closely with Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, Birmingham's ultra-segregationist sixty-three-year-old commissioner of public safety - provided the organization with detailed information on the Ride, including a city-by-city itinerary . . .\n\nIn a flurry of secret meetings in April and early May, the Klansmen - with Cook's help - prepared a rude welcome for the invading \"n*ggers\" and \"n*gger lovers\" who were about to violate the timeworn customs and laws of the sovereign state of Alabama.\n\nOne member of the Eastview Klavern, the most violent Klan outfit in Alabama, was an FBI informant. He passed the information all the way up the chain, meaning that the bureau's director J. Edgar Hoover was aware of the coming violence. Hoover did nothing to stop it.\n\nThe riders had caught wind of a mob waiting for them in Alabama, but they had no idea how violent it would be. Just as with the Journey of Reconciliation, there were two buses: one Greyhound and one Trailways bus. South of Anniston, Alabama, the Greyhound bus was flagged down on the road, and a white man warned the riders that a mob was waiting for them in town. When the bus pulled into Anniston, they were greeted by a mob of fifty Klansmen armed with pipes, clubs, and chains.\n\nAccording to Arsenault's history, the Klansmen yelled racial epithets and shouted \"Dirty Communists!\" and \"Sig heil!\" as they surrounded the bus. Passengers were able to close the door from the inside by leaning on it, preventing the mob from entering, but the mob began smashing the bus windows with rocks and brass knuckles. Eventually the police arrived and escorted the bus through town, but they abandoned it at the town's edge.\n\nJust outside the town limits, the bus was overwhelmed by \"thirty or forty cars and trucks jammed with shrieking whites.\" It was forced to pull over. The mob began rocking it back and forth as the riders barricaded themselves inside. An assailant threw a homemade bomb through an open window, which exploded inside, causing the riders to exit the bus as the mob yelled \"Burn them alive\" and \"Fry the goddamn n*ggers.\"\n\nSome of the riders were beaten, and many were convinced they might die. But then the fuel tank on the flaming bus exploded, and the mob became afraid for their own safety. As the riders lay on the ground \"coughing and bleeding,\" a second fuel tank exploded, driving the mob away. The riders were sent to the hospital, but the Klan followed them there, causing them to flee.\n\nThis was only one of the scenes of brutal violence the Freedom Riders faced in Alabama. The riders of the other bus were beaten unconscious by Klansmen in Anniston, and when both groups arrived in Birmingham, they were greeted by white mobs that meted out beatings with bats, chains, and pipes. Police sergeant Tom Cook and Birmingham, Alabama, commissioner of public safety Bull Connor had promised the Klan in Birmingham that they could have fifteen minutes to do whatever they wanted to the riders, with no interference from police. Black riders were subjected to a string of racist insults as they were beaten mercilessly. Onlookers yelled \"Kill the n*gger,\" and many of the black riders recall feeling that they were moments away from being lynched.\n\nBut the white riders were not spared violence in Birmingham either. White assailants called them \"n*gger lovers,\" and one screamed, \"You damn communists, why don't you go back to Russia, you're a shame to the white race.\" James Peck, a white CORE leader who had also participated in the Journey of Reconciliation, was beaten so badly that his head required fifty stitches. The first hospital he was taken to refused to treat him.\n\nAfter the violence in Alabama, the original riders felt that they could not go on. But news of the events had galvanized more volunteers. A group of new riders from SNCC traveled to Birmingham to take their place. They were arrested by Bull Connor and dumped across state lines, but still more came.\n\nNow, civil rights was back in the national spotlight and back on Kennedy's agenda - and Kennedy didn't like it. The president snapped at a civil rights leader, \"Can't you get your goddamn friends off those buses?\" His brother, Bobby Kennedy, urged a \"cooling off\" period, but SNCC, CORE, and the SCLC refused. Instead, they formed a Freedom Rides Coordinating Committee, which kept the rides going all through the summer.\n\nEach new round of arrests or mob violence only encouraged greater participation from black and white civil rights activists. And the rides also helped reenergize and further organize the broader civil rights movement. Davis and Wiener observe:\n\nThe Rides, of course, were more than just the Riders: they centrally involved Black campuses and communities in almost every Southern state, as well as tens of thousands of active supporters North of the Mason-Dixon line, who marched in support demonstrations, organized hundreds of meetings, and raised funds to meet the extortionate bails set by segregationist judges.\n\nThe Freedom Rides, along with a concurrent wave of sit-ins staged by the newly empowered SNCC, became the catalyst for a new wave of civil rights struggle that extended all the way through the mid-1960s, including the March on Washington in 1963 and the Freedom Summer voter registration drive in the South in 1964. It was one of the most pivotal moments of the civil rights movement. On account of the structure of the actions, the 436 participants of the 1961 Freedom Rides were black and white in equal number.\n\nThe fact that the Freedom Rides were multiracial was not incidental. While it's probably a damning indictment of the mainstream media's racist priorities for what kind of activist did or did not deserve coverage, the knowledge that white protestors had been beaten by segregationists helped generate publicity and turn many white people into supporters - and the model of white participation helped turn many white supporters into activists themselves. The shift in white sentiment magnified the potency of the movement. And the participation of whites added numerically to the movement's ranks. All of this made civil rights and racial equality significantly harder for the Kennedy administration, and later the Johnson administration, to ignore.\n\nThe lessons we can take from the Freedom Rides are endless. The potential of multiracial solidarity to strengthen the struggle for racial equality - something to be not merely tolerated but wielded creatively and strategically - is one worth taking to heart.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

Civil rights organizers have historically considered this an asset and often used it creatively and strategically to their advantage, as they did during the Freedom Rides through the American South in 1961.\n\nThe military guard a bus en route from Montgomery, Alabama, as the Freedom Riders head for Jackson, Mississippi, on May 26 1961.

They have also leveled a system-wide demand to defund the police .\n\nThe protests have emerged in in more American cities and towns than any protest movement in our nation's history. A striking feature of the movement is its highly multiracial character. Approached strategically, this can be a key strength. One of the lessons of the twentieth-century struggle for civil rights is that a multiracial activist base can be a major asset.\n\nFor a creative and successful example of multiracial anti-racist activism, look no further than the Freedom Rides that challenged segregated bus travel in the Jim Crow South.\n\nThe Freedom Rides of 1961 were an echo of an earlier organizing strategy known as the Journey of Reconciliation. In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated seating on interstate bus routes was illegal. But anti-segregation organizers knew better than to prematurely celebrate. Just because something was technically illegal in the United States didn't mean it wouldn't be practiced in the Jim Crow South. It remained to be seen whether the law of the land would be enforced.\n\nThe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) was then a fledgling group that believed the principles of Gandhian nonviolent direct action could be applied to the struggle for racial equality in the United States.

His brand of racial uplift and black entrepreneurialism accommodated itself to Jim Crow and colonialism but fell out of favor as radical alternatives emerged.\n\nFounder and leader of the UNIA Marcus Garvey, August 5, 1924. (Underwood Archives / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn August 1920, an audacious scene took place in Madison Square Garden. Around twenty-five thousand black delegates, gathered for the first convention of the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), drafted and approved a Declaration of Negro Rights. At that gathering, Marcus Garvey, the founder and undisputed leader of the UNIA, was elected as the Provisional President of Africa. The proceedings were supported from afar by UNIA chapters not only in urban US cities, but also in the West Indies, Latin America, and Africa.\n\nWithin just five years, Garvey would be exiled in prison and his organization in terminal decline. But for a brief moment he and the UNIA did what other leaders and organizations up to that point could never do: they built a truly mass following among urban blacks of various classes.\n\nDespite the patina of militancy and radicalism, the Garvey movement represented a fundamentally conservative trend in black political history. At its core, the project combined two regressive tendencies in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century black politics. The first was an abandonment of the more radical aims of reconstruction in favor of a politics of self-help, racial uplift, and entrepreneurialism. The second was an embrace of Pan-Africanism, made possible by the coincidence of the end of slavery in the United States and the ratcheting up of colonialism in Africa. This allowed aspiring members of the black bourgeoisie to conceive of themselves as spearheading the West's civilizing mission.\n\nUltimately, the UNIA emerged as a response to a deep-seated pessimism about the closing off of avenues for progressive political change for the bulk of the black population.\n\nMarcus Garvey was born in Jamaica on August 17, 1887. Unlike the majority of his countrypeople, Garvey's family were artisans rather than peasants. Malchus Garvey was a master stonemason and his wife, Sarah Richards, was a domestic servant. According to Garvey's own recollections, his first confrontation with his race came when the parents of his white childhood playmate eventually forced them to stop being friends.\n\nBeginning an apprenticeship as a printer, Garvey quickly showed an aptitude for political involvement. In 1908, he joined with other printers in an unsuccessful strike. Jamaica could not satisfy his energies, and he went to work for the United Fruit Company as a timekeeper, a job that allowed the young Garvey to travel throughout the Caribbean and observe the poor conditions of black workers.\n\nHis political philosophy began to congeal when he traveled to England in 1912. It was here that Garvey established contact with the Sudanese-Egyptian actor, playwright, and political activist Dusé Mohamed Ali. From the pages of Ali's African Times and Orient Review , Garvey would familarize himself with the broad tenets of Pan-Africanism.\n\nThe Pan-Africanism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had an unabashedly elitist outlook toward Africa, dovetailing in significant ways with European colonial thinking. Its early ideologues were black elites who sincerely believed in Enlightenment ideals and were frustrated at their blocked entry into the professions due to their race.\n\nBelieving that colonial rule was necessary to create civilized nations, the early Pan-Africanist elites saw themselves as the natural leaders of colonized Africans. Notably, Pan-Africanist conferences before World War I did not include representatives from mass organizations within Africa, but were peppered with various isolated intellectuals from around the world.\n\nGarvey returned to Jamaica and founded the UNIA explicitly with the aim of bringing Western civilization to Africa. The UNIA's founding documents include references to \"civilizing the backward tribes of Africa,\" attempts to \"strengthen the imperialism of independent African states,\" and encouraging \"a conscientious Christian worship among the native tribes of Africa.\"\n\nThe UNIA's program differed fundamentally from previous movements to relocate black people from the Western Hemisphere to Africa. Garvey offered career advancement opportunities and a civilizing mission, not land, to those who participated in his project. UNIA vice president William Sherrill explained, \"The UNIA is not a 'Back to Africa' movement, it is a movement to redeem Africa.\"\n\nGarvey stated his aim clearly by declaring, \"If native Africans are unable to appreciate the value of their own country from the standard of Western civilization, then it is for us, their brothers, to take to them the knowledge and information that they need to help to develop the country for the common good.\"\n\nThis emphasis on cultural improvement was not limited to those on the African continent. In his address to the first annual meeting of UNIA in 1915, Garvey lamented, \"As a society we realize that the negro people of Jamaica need a great deal of improvement. The bulk of our people are in darkness and are really unfit for good society. To the cultured mind the bulk of our people are contemptible - that is to say, they are entirely outside the pale of cultured appreciation.\"\n\nHe believed to remedy this situation the UNIA had to \"set itself the task to go among the people and help them up to a better state of appreciation among the cultured classes, and raise them to the standard of civilized approval.\"\n\nThe Garvey worldview did not challenge the prevailing assumption that society was composed of a hierarchy of competing racial groups. The problem was not then the existence of racial hierarchies, but that the black race was at the bottom and lacked the proper leadership and program to rise to the top.\n\nInspired by Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery , Garvey's first initiatives in Jamaica followed the Tuskegee playbook. He submitted a petition for land to start a trade school for delinquent boys but it was rejected. Like Washington, his early efforts depended largely on the patronage of prominent whites.\n\nAt UNIA meetings, special mention was made of clergymen, businessmen, and colonial officials who were in attendance. Writing to associate Robert Russa Moton in 1918, Garvey confided, \"Up to now my one true friend as far as you can rely on his friendship, is the white man.\"\n\nGarvey left for the United States in 1916 on a lecture tour in the hopes of raising money for his school. He did not raise much money, but did meet prominent black intellectuals such as W. E. B. Du Bois. More importantly, the trip convinced Garvey that the United States was most ripe for his ideas about black business enterprises and the redemption of Africa.\n\nThe first UNIA branch in the United States was established in New York City sometime between late 1917 and early 1918. Fortunately for Garvey, his arrival coincided with an exceptionally dynamic period in black social life. A wily political operator, he was able to evolve and adapt his vision to capitalize on the moment.\n\nWorld War I opened up employment opportunities and brought scores of southern African Americans to the urban North and Midwest. During and immediately after the war, a number of combative strikes and race riots took place. Liberal segments of the early civil rights movement, such as the young Du Bois, held onto the view that if black soldiers fought bravely they'd be granted more civil rights when they returned. The raised expectations, followed soon by dashed hopes, heightened a sense of racial militancy and civil rights activism amongst blacks. In 1919 alone, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) added thirty-five thousand members nationally.\n\nAfter the St Louis race riot of 1917, which resulted in the deaths of at least thirty-nine African Americans and nine whites, Garvey shifted his rhetoric to include a bigger emphasis on self-defense and confrontation with whites.\n\nThe brief surge in radicalism was crushed by state repression. As the war drew to a close, labor shortages, which had strengthened the hand of black and white workers, reduced and pushed the labor movement back on the defensive. The American Federation of Labor's refusal to organize unskilled workers, which included most black workers, further undermined the possibility of a multiracial working-class politics.\n\nIt was in this context that Garvey's ideology and movement took off. It saw the fact that many blacks lacked viable political avenues and were denied access to the labor movement as an opportunity. Garvey and the UNIA responded to this closing off of possibilities by leaping \"into the ocean of black unhappiness,\" as the African-American journalist Roi Ottley put it in 1943.\n\nAt the same time, Garvey's ideology confirmed already existing realities and provided people with a grand project to attain the glory they were being denied. The gospel of self-help had as its natural accompaniment a cynicism about the possibilities of interracial organizing, which was confirmed by the reality that many black people in the first half of the twentieth century were living through. In espousing entrepreneurialism as an alternative to politics, Garvey was not carving out a new path for black politics. He was building on themes that were already endorsed by mainstream black organizations such as the NAACP and Urban League.\n\nSoon Garvey established a project to give concrete expression to his dream of global black economic power. During the war, politicians popularized the purchasing of Liberty Bonds, war debt sold by the US government, as a way of building wealth. After the war, the UNIA would begin selling its own bonds for the establishment of a black owned and operated steamship company, the Black Star Line. This company would, Garvey and his followers claimed, serve as the basis for a vast trading network with the African continent and the West Indies.\n\nThe UNIA saw in the growing black working class a potential source of income to be tapped into. It is not coincidental that the first UNIA chapters were established in higher-wage industrial states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois. What gave the Garvey movement its special character was that, despite having a base in the black elite, it was dependent on large segments of the black masses in order to fund its ambitious project. Because of this, the UNIA was forced to develop a populist rhetoric that allowed them to enlist the working class for a fundamentally bourgeois politics.\n\nThe UNIA created institutions that gave members a sense of social standing and validation that they weren't getting in the outside world. Black men could join the African Legion and march in regal uniforms. Black women could march with the Black Cross Nurses and had a whole section devoted to them in the Negro World , the official UNIA newspaper.\n\nFrustrated, ambitious men like Jacob Samuel Mills joined the UNIA. Mills was a master carpenter, but was banned from the carpenter's union on account of his race and could only find work as a janitor. The UNIA opened its doors to him.\n\nThe talented actress Henrietta Vinton Davis represented what scholar Judith Stein describes as \"the cultural wing of the petite bourgeoisie attracted to the UNIA.\" Davis read poems at UNIA meetings and used black dolls as props, ending with a plea for members to support the business that created the dolls and thus helped to bolster racial pride. Similar kinds of racial entrepreneurialism can be seen today in the numerous buy black initiatives that have flourished in the era of Black Lives Matter.\n\nBlack sociologist E. Franklin Frazier examined the deep appeal of the Garvey movement in his essay \"Garvey: A Mass Leader,\" writing, \"He made the Negro an important person in his immediate environment. He invented honors and social distinctions and converted every social invention to his use in his effort to make his followers feel important.\"\n\nFrazier went on to say, \"A Negro may be a porter during the day, taking his orders from white men, but he was an officer in the black army when it assembled at night in Liberty Hall.\"\n\nTrinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, despite describing Garvey's program as \"pitiable rubbish,\" recognized that the Jamaican's power lay in his acute ability to channel and express the deep frustrations the black masses were feeling. Part of the explanation for Garvey's appeal was, James observed that, \"desperate men often hear, not the actual words of an orator but their own thoughts.\"\n\nBy the time of the first UNIA convention in August, 1920, the Black Star Line possessed three ships. The fact that these ships were of poor quality and losing money would not matter much yet, for at this time they were more important as powerful symbols of propaganda.\n\nThe Declaration of Negro Rights that the convention published was a sprawling document that echoed many of the same grievances and demands that other civil rights organizations were pushing at the time. Segregation at home and imperialism in Africa were denounced, while calls for equality were issued.\n\nGarvey was declared the Provisional President of Africa, of course without the knowledge or consent of those living in Africa. No overarching strategy or program for achieving any of the desired goals was outlined besides the building of the Black Star Line.\n\nThe 1920 convention marked the high point of the UNIA's popularity and influence. There were simply no viable alternatives on the Left to counter Garvey's hegemony. Black socialist A. Philip Randolph, who introduced Garvey to Harlem's soapbox speaker scene, fought bitterly against him during this period.\n\nReflecting on these confusing times later in life, Randolph observed that:\n\nWhat you needed to follow Garvey was a leap of imagination, but socialism and trade unionism called for rigorous social struggle - hard work and programs - and few people wanted to think about that. Against the emotional power of Garveyism, what I was preaching didn't stand a chance.\n\nBy this time, Garvey had shed any sympathies with socialism and fully embraced capitalism. He eschewed trade unionism, suggesting instead, \"If the Negro takes my advice he will organize by himself and always keep his scale of wage a little lower than the whites until he is able to become, through proper leadership, his own employer.\"\n\nGarvey's anti-unionism was entirely consistent with his aim to build a global black capitalist empire. Perhaps the most succinct summary of this view is in a 1923 article titled \"Africa's Wealth,\" where Garvey quipped, \"Why should not Africa give to the world its black Rockefeller, Rothschild and Henry Ford?\"\n\nEventually, the mass fervor and ceremonial extravagance of the UNIA could not paper over the untenable contradictions at the heart of the movement. Garvey's authoritarian leadership style, the pervasive organizational incompetence at all levels, and the lack of a coherent program would doom the UNIA.\n\nThe Black Star Line was never a financially viable enterprise. From the beginning, operating expenses dwarfed profits and all three ships were purchased in a bad state and had to be abandoned after limited use.\n\nDespite the rhetoric of the Black Star Line being an agent of black economic empowerment, its workers experienced the same kind of precarity that is common at most small-scale business enterprises. Often workers were paid in Black Star Line notes instead of actual wages, and ship captains that questioned Garvey's decisions were removed or silenced.\n\nHugh Mulzac was captain of the Black Star Line's first ship, the Yarmouth. The discrimination he faced during World War I drew him into the movement, but soon he would be disillusioned. He wrote in his memoirs that the Yarmouth did not engage in productive economic activity, \"but was simply being used as a propaganda device for recruiting new members to UNIA.\" After leaving the UNIA, Mulzac would become an organizer with the National Maritime Union in the 1930s.\n\nThe UNIA's forays into Africa also floundered. Garvey focused on Liberia since the British were too powerful in other areas. A $2 million construction loan for infrastructure was secured, but the UNIA was unable to raise the funds and had to abandon the project. More importantly, the UNIA was never able to win over the Liberian ruling class to their plans.\n\nUNIA membership was already starting to decline in 1921. Leaders began to leave the organization, and more dissent emerged from within about Garvey's poor management of money. As the unifying project of the Black Star Line fell apart, there was little to stop the degeneration of the organization into competing factions of ambitious people.\n\nAt its heart, the ideology of Garveyism did not lend itself to the activity of organization. In her brilliant book The World of Marcus Garvey , Stein aptly describes the UNIA program as \"oscillating without design between the poles of retaliatory violence and individual self-help. . . . Most recommendations required little active collective implementation because they were exhortations to individuals.\"\n\nThe logical conclusion of Garvey's racial ideology was fully revealed in his dealings with the Ku Klux Klan in the Jim Crow South. These backroom dealings would further isolate him from popular black opinion.\n\nGarvey's views on Jim Crow were incoherent; in one breath he denounced it and in the next offered praise. He said the South deserves credit for having \"lynched race pride into the Negroes.\" Since he viewed the world as a competition between races in the quest for civilization, an almost begrudging admiration for Jim Crow can be seen in Garvey.\n\nIn one speech, Garvey remarked, \"I'm not vexed with the white man of the South for Jim Crowing me because I'm black. I never built any street cars or railroads. The white man built them for your own convenience.\"\n\nOn June 25, 1922, Garvey met with Edward Clarke, a high-ranking Klan leader. Stein places this move in the context of his elitist perspective on politics and organizational need to grow in the South. According to Stein, \"Garvey's politics was the diplomacy of elites. The Klan meeting was a bold attempt to advance the UNIA in the South through political summitry.\"\n\nThe meeting with the Klan brought denunciation not just from established black figures, but from within the UNIA as well. Even apart from this meeting, the UNIA's unwillingness to challenge the institutions of Jim Crow prevented them from developing a mass base in the South. Stein explains, \"For most southern blacks . . . the burdens of political powerlessness were central to the prospects of the race. Groups that deferred those issues might become social clubs useful to small numbers, but they could not become mass organizations of significant racial power.\"\n\nA \"Garvey Must Go\" campaign emerged among leading civil rights activists and organizations who even tried to pressure the attorney general to have him deported. In 1922, the FBI arrested and convicted Garvey for mail fraud in connection to a Black Star Line advertisement. After spending a few years in prison, he was deported to Jamaica in 1927.\n\nGarvey attempted to continue political activity, but changing political tides hindered his ability to resonate. In the 1930s, workers in the West Indies began to form trade unions, create labor parties, and launch large-scale strikes. In Trinidad, as the oil workers struck, Garvey claimed they didn't have a right to strike and was told in clear terms he wasn't welcome there anymore by the president of Trinidad's UNIA branch.\n\nGarvey returned to England in 1935 and gave lectures to mostly small crowds. In the United States, the emergence of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and New Deal politics largely displaced the Garveyite ideology of individual self-help and racial uplift for black working people.\n\nGarvey died on June 10, 1940. Echoes of his ideas have reemerged throughout black history until today. From the cultural tutelage of war on poverty programs to Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March, there have consistently been currents in black politics that promote individualist and ethnic chauvinist solutions to collective social problems.\n\nAn eviscerated welfare state and declining labor movement has once again made possible the resurgence of ideas of racial entrepreneurialism and black capitalism. Even, or perhaps especially, around and within the current Black Lives Matter movement, the interests of black individuals or corporate forces are consistently framed as identical to those of the broader black population.\n\nUltimately, the politics of racial uplift are inherently contradictory. Like Garvey's UNIA, it can only flourish briefly by attaching itself to hollow symbols which are no alternative to economic or political justice. But in the absence of a political program capable of enacting genuine change, these cycles in which enthusiasm fueled by hucksters is followed by disillusionment are doomed to repeat themselves.\n\nPaul Prescod is a Jacobin contributing editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn August 1920, an audacious scene took place in Madison Square Garden. Around twenty-five thousand black delegates, gathered for the first convention of the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), drafted and approved a Declaration of Negro Rights. At that gathering, Marcus Garvey, the founder and undisputed leader of the UNIA, was elected as the Provisional President of Africa. The proceedings were supported from afar by UNIA chapters not only in urban US cities, but also in the West Indies, Latin America, and Africa.\n\nWithin just five years, Garvey would be exiled in prison and his organization in terminal decline. But for a brief moment he and the UNIA did what other leaders and organizations up to that point could never do: they built a truly mass following among urban blacks of various classes.\n\nDespite the patina of militancy and radicalism, the Garvey movement represented a fundamentally conservative trend in black political history. At its core, the project combined two regressive tendencies in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century black politics. The first was an abandonment of the more radical aims of reconstruction in favor of a politics of self-help, racial uplift, and entrepreneurialism. The second was an embrace of Pan-Africanism, made possible by the coincidence of the end of slavery in the United States and the ratcheting up of colonialism in Africa. This allowed aspiring members of the black bourgeoisie to conceive of themselves as spearheading the West's civilizing mission.\n\nUltimately, the UNIA emerged as a response to a deep-seated pessimism about the closing off of avenues for progressive political change for the bulk of the black population.\n\nMarcus Garvey was born in Jamaica on August 17, 1887. Unlike the majority of his countrypeople, Garvey's family were artisans rather than peasants. Malchus Garvey was a master stonemason and his wife, Sarah Richards, was a domestic servant. According to Garvey's own recollections, his first confrontation with his race came when the parents of his white childhood playmate eventually forced them to stop being friends.\n\nBeginning an apprenticeship as a printer, Garvey quickly showed an aptitude for political involvement. In 1908, he joined with other printers in an unsuccessful strike. Jamaica could not satisfy his energies, and he went to work for the United Fruit Company as a timekeeper, a job that allowed the young Garvey to travel throughout the Caribbean and observe the poor conditions of black workers.\n\nHis political philosophy began to congeal when he traveled to England in 1912.

In her brilliant book The World of Marcus Garvey , Stein aptly describes the UNIA program as \"oscillating without design between the poles of retaliatory violence and individual self-help. . . . Most recommendations required little active collective implementation because they were exhortations to individuals.\"\n\nThe logical conclusion of Garvey's racial ideology was fully revealed in his dealings with the Ku Klux Klan in the Jim Crow South. These backroom dealings would further isolate him from popular black opinion.\n\nGarvey's views on Jim Crow were incoherent; in one breath he denounced it and in the next offered praise. He said the South deserves credit for having \"lynched race pride into the Negroes.\" Since he viewed the world as a competition between races in the quest for civilization, an almost begrudging admiration for Jim Crow can be seen in Garvey.\n\nIn one speech, Garvey remarked, \"I'm not vexed with the white man of the South for Jim Crowing me because I'm black. I never built any street cars or railroads. The white man built them for your own convenience.\"\n\nOn June 25, 1922, Garvey met with Edward Clarke, a high-ranking Klan leader. Stein places this move in the context of his elitist perspective on politics and organizational need to grow in the South. According to Stein, \"Garvey's politics was the diplomacy of elites. The Klan meeting was a bold attempt to advance the UNIA in the South through political summitry.\"\n\nThe meeting with the Klan brought denunciation not just from established black figures, but from within the UNIA as well. Even apart from this meeting, the UNIA's unwillingness to challenge the institutions of Jim Crow prevented them from developing a mass base in the South. Stein explains, \"For most southern blacks . . . the burdens of political powerlessness were central to the prospects of the race. Groups that deferred those issues might become social clubs useful to small numbers, but they could not become mass organizations of significant racial power.\"\n\nA \"Garvey Must Go\" campaign emerged among leading civil rights activists and organizations who even tried to pressure the attorney general to have him deported. In 1922, the FBI arrested and convicted Garvey for mail fraud in connection to a Black Star Line advertisement. After spending a few years in prison, he was deported to Jamaica in 1927.\n\nGarvey attempted to continue political activity, but changing political tides hindered his ability to resonate. In the 1930s, workers in the West Indies began to form trade unions, create labor parties, and launch large-scale strikes. In Trinidad, as the oil workers struck, Garvey claimed they didn't have a right to strike and was told in clear terms he wasn't welcome there anymore by the president of Trinidad's UNIA branch.\n\nGarvey returned to England in 1935 and gave lectures to mostly small crowds. In the United States, the emergence of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and New Deal politics largely displaced the Garveyite ideology of individual self-help and racial uplift for black working people.\n\nGarvey died on June 10, 1940. Echoes of his ideas have reemerged throughout black history until today. From the cultural tutelage of war on poverty programs to Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March, there have consistently been currents in black politics that promote individualist and ethnic chauvinist solutions to collective social problems.\n\nAn eviscerated welfare state and declining labor movement has once again made possible the resurgence of ideas of racial entrepreneurialism and black capitalism. Even, or perhaps especially, around and within the current Black Lives Matter movement, the interests of black individuals or corporate forces are consistently framed as identical to those of the broader black population.\n\nUltimately, the politics of racial uplift are inherently contradictory. Like Garvey's UNIA, it can only flourish briefly by attaching itself to hollow symbols which are no alternative to economic or political justice. But in the absence of a political program capable of enacting genuine change, these cycles in which enthusiasm fueled by hucksters is followed by disillusionment are doomed to repeat themselves.\n\nPaul Prescod is a Jacobin contributing editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Racism and sexism are rigorous gatekeepers of America's halls of power. Consequently, the mere presence of a biracial Black American woman of Indian descent in the race at this stage is a challenge to the status quo. But Harris' run is also historic in another, less discussed way.\n\nFollow MSNBC's live blog for real-time updates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Doug Emhoff and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - Harris' husband and vice presidential running mate, respectively - embody figures rarely before observed in American life: white men who know their place.\n\nRacism and sexism are rigorous gatekeepers of America's halls of power.\n\nThat is to say, white men who know their supportive place and seem to occupy it without hesitation or resentment. This is the first time our national political stage has hosted two white men whose role is to passionately champion a Black woman all the way to the White House.\n\nObviously, it's vitally important not to diminish Harris as the main character in this political story. But it's still worth examining the optics presented by Walz and Emhoff, because those two white guys are defying and potentially redefining America's vision of authority and leadership. Amid all the racist, sexist MAGA detritus that surrounds us, the Harris campaign is a necessary glimpse at what American power, equality and truly inclusive democracy could someday look like.\n\nThat redefinition would be notable in any moment, but it's particularly important in the dark timeline we find ourselves on. Former President Donald Trump's frequent attacks on Black women journalists and insults toward Black women lawmakers have energized masses of racist misogynists. The corrosive spillage of MAGA identity politics - in addition to innumerable anti-woman and anti- anti-racist laws, policy proposals and civil rights rollbacks - has included the absurd notion that white masculinity is in crisis.\n\nWalz seems to have understood the assignment from the jump. During vetting interviews, Walz reportedly volunteered that he wasn't \" angling for anything else \" and emphasized, \" This is not about me .\" Both quotes suggest Walz not only understood the level of deference and loyalty required, but also took pains to establish that he would have no issues offering both to a Black woman superior.\n\n\"Being strategically invisible or staying in the background will require a humility that many white men have never had to demonstrate,\" Sheletta Brundidge, a Minnesota-based Black woman author, wrote in a Minnesota Star Tribune op-ed . \"She's going to be Gladys Knight; he will be a Pip.\"\n\nSince his selection, Walz has seemed joyful as second-in-command, radiating an ease in the role that most likely assuages the reflexive discomfort some voters - and particularly white voters - would feel seeing the boss is a Black woman.\n\nThe tendency to view Black women with suspicion and hostility remains.\n\nThe misogynist smears that might allow MAGA types to portray Walz as a \"beta\" for playing second banana to a Black woman are simply less effective because of his background as a football coach, hunter, gun owner and National Guard veteran. Misogynoir falsely pathologizes Black women as inherently anormal - but as an older, rural-coded Midwestern white man, Walz is regarded as almost aggressively normal - or as the headlines put it, \" all-American \" and an \" everyman .\"\n\nThe tendency to view Black women with suspicion and hostility - to interpret the mildest pleas for equitable change as inherently dangerous and threatening - remains. But the Harris campaign might succeed in moving the needle a bit on those perceptions.\n\nThe same reassurances are provided by Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman- turned-Harris campaign surrogate, whose demonstrations of supportive partnership earned his reputation as a \" wife guy \" as far back as 2019. Emhoff's loving advocacy of his wife's ascendance consistently suggests he feels he \"married up\" - a sentiment rarely extended to Black women in a system in which even their femininity is routinely questioned. (Right-wing memes questioning both Michelle Obama's and Harris' gender are par for the MAGA course.)\n\nEmhoff ditched his career as a firm's partner attorney to attend to his wife's, breaking with all gender expectations, especially those attached to white men who have succeeded in corporate America. In positioning himself as the white man happily standing behind a great Black woman, Emhoff exemplifies a breed of white male masculinity in opposition to MAGA's camp, women-hating, masculinity - one that emphasizes partnership and respect over insecure dominance and superiority. \"I'm honored now to have my wife be at the top of the ticket,\" Emhoff recently announced on a podcast . \"I cannot tell you how proud I am of her.\"\n\nEmhoff's words are a rejection of the idea that Black women's goals should somehow be contained, that Black women are taking up too much space or vying for spots that somehow always rightfully belong to someone else. And it's the opposite of the right's fragile white masculinity model, which views gender equality as oppressive and racial justice as unbearable.\n\nSeveral decades back, these folks would probably have called Emhoff and Walz \"N-word lovers\" and kept it moving, but now they use more euphemistic terms.\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed Walz is \" afraid of testosterone .\" Rob Schmitt, a Newsmax anchor, described Walz as \"the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people\" - a gender and racial turncoat, if you will. Donald Trump Jr., the creative one in the family, predictably labeled the White Dudes for Harris fundraising call \" Cucks for Kamala .\" And Christopher Rufo, the right-wing architect of the phony \"critical race theory\" panic, was so apoplectic over the announcement of Walz's appointment that he spent the whole day firing off social media copes .\n\nThe two are working against deeply ingrained, stubbornly persistent and highly damaging ideas about whiteness and maleness.\n\nNone of this is to suggest Walz and Emhoff should be lauded as American superheroes. White men are praised enough for doing the absolute barest of minimums on behalf of decency, and \"white saviorism\" is among our country's most tired tropes. But the two are working against deeply ingrained, stubbornly persistent and highly damaging ideas about whiteness and maleness, modeling behavior that really shouldn't be so expectation-defying at this point - and yet.\n\n\"How often in 100 days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in 100 days do you get to do something that's going to impact generations to come?\" Walz asked attendees on the White Dudes for Harris call . \"And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his ass, sent him on the road?\"\n\nIt's yet another idea that Harris herself couldn't push too strongly, lest she set off alarm bells, handing MAGA something to scare white voters over. But the point stands, nonetheless.\n\nKali Holloway is a writer and journalist.

      "text": "James Patterson's claim that racism hampers white men is his most fictional work yet\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nAccording to bestselling writer James Patterson , the self-proclaimed \"world's bestselling author,\" white men are having a hard time finding writing jobs in film, theater, TV and publishing in America. Patterson, a white man who really came to fame by writing novels starring Alex Cross, a crime-solving Black detective, this alleged lack of jobs for white male writers is \"just another form of racism.\"\n\nIt's an argument we hear way too often from white people who believe the mere presence of people of color can only mean there's been mistreatment of white people.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times , Patterson, who has an estimated net worth of $800 million , said, \"What's that all about? Can you get a job? Yes. Is it harder? Yes. It's even harder for older writers. You don't meet many 52-year-old white males.\"\n\nIt's an argument we hear way too often in the United States from white people who believe the mere presence of people of color in rarified or even less rarified spaces can only mean there's been some mistreatment of white people.\n\nThe backlash to Patterson's stupid statement prompted a mealy-mouthed apology from him on Twitter : \"I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work is a form of racism. I absolutely do not believe that racism is practiced against white writers. Please know that I strongly support a diversity of voices being heard-in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.\"\n\nEven that apology doesn't retract Patterson's original rant. He now says that it might not be racism that's to blame but that white males as a group are having a hard time finding work, by which he must mean that they're not dominating entertainment and publishing to the total exclusion of everybody else. Because all the numbers show that white people are over-represented and other races are being wrongly excluded.\n\nIn a survey of widely read English language fiction books published by America's biggest publishing houses, two authors writing for The New York Times found that in 2018, 89% of those authors were white , even though white people make up only 60% of the population. That's little better than the pair's finding that between 1950 and 2018, 95% of the authors of such books were white. Also, according to the Diversity Baseline Survey, in 2019, 76% of the publishing industry was white .\n\nWhite Americans also dominate Hollywood entertainment. While minority audiences buy the most movie tickets, people from such groups accounted for 25.4% of Hollywood directors and 25.9% of film writers in 2020 .\n\nPatterson appears to be fondly remembering a more racist America and wishing for its return.\n\nAnd it's not just in publishing and entertaining. This is true in just about every desirable white-collar job. White men have advantaged access to high-paying white and blue collar jobs in most states. And even advantages to the better working-class jobs. Who are white men's greatest competitors? Better educated white women, according to the report \"Race, States, and the Mixed Fate of White Men.\"\n\nPatterson appears to be fondly remembering a more racist America and wishing for its return.\n\nThere's an old axiom that says, \"To the privileged, equality feels like oppression.\" But as the above numbers show, things are nowhere near equality and yet Patterson is speaking as if white men are oppressed.\n\nWhen I hear older white men talking about their fondness for the \"good old days\" or making this country \"great again,\" all I hear is that they want to return to a time where white American men controlled everything and deserved everything.\n\nOh, they moan, if we could only go back to the good old days, when men were men and women were women and we didn't have to think about color or gender or sexuality. Things were good back then.\n\nNever once do they mention their domination did not come through fair competition. White men weren't on top because they outcompeted other workers. Their dominance came at the barrel of a gun, at the feet of a mob, or through the use of a noose. And via legalized sexism, racism and homophobia.\n\nThey don't seem to notice that in that glorious past they remember, white men benefited from others not being allowed to compete. So they didn't always win by skill. Sometimes they won by default.\n\nTheir domination did not come through fair competition. White men weren't on top because they outcompeted other workers.\n\nThe book on that world is closed, both in fiction and in reality. Cry about it, if you want. The rest of us? We're glad to be finally getting to a world that at least pretends to give everyone a chance, instead of assuming that only white is right.\n\nInstead of pretending that there's an absence of white male authors, Patterson should acknowledge the absence of writers who aren't and put his famous Black detective on the case.\n\nIt won't take long for Cross to name the culprit as racism: the real racism, not the made-up kind Patterson suggests harms people like himself.\n\nJesse J.

It's a point writer George Packer essentially made for The Atlantic in his recent article about Phoenix, aptly titled \"The Most American City.\"\n\nI thought about Packer's article and my parents' outlook about Arizona on Wednesday, when federal officials announced they'd arrested Mark Prieto, a white man in Prescott, Arizona, who was allegedly plotting a mass shooting he believed would ignite a race war.\n\nAs NBC News reported:\n\nAn Arizona man planned a mass shooting targeting African Americans and other minorities at a rap concert in Atlanta in May, looking to incite a race war ahead of the presidential election, federal authorities said. Mark Adams Prieto was indicted by a federal grand jury Tuesday on charges of firearms trafficking, transfer of a firearm for use in a hate crime and possession of an unregistered firearm. The indictment follows a monthslong investigation by the FBI that ended with his arrest last month, the Justice Department said. A spokesperson for the agency said Prieto is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for transport from New Mexico to Arizona. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nVirtually all of my coverage about Arizona politics reflects my belief that, to truly understand politics in the U.S., one need look no further than Arizona. And that certainly applies to the strain of violent extremism in the state , an increasingly disturbing trend that has many Arizonans sounding alarm bells heading into this year's elections. Prescott, for example, where Prieto lived, and similarly remote areas of northern Arizona have long been known as breeding grounds for racist extremism.\n\nPrescott is in the congressional district represented by Republican Rep. Paul Gosar, a man who has referred to the border crisis as an \"invasion of illegal aliens,\" echoing white nationalist rhetoric , and has promoted and appeared at a white nationalist event (he blamed his video appearance on a \"miscommunication\" with staff), and who had several staffers with reported ties to white nationalists (in response to that reporting, Gosar's office told the Arizona Mirror he has \"the longest and most thorough record of support for Israel and the Jewish people in the House\" and that the staffers no longer work for him).\n\nIn this article from 2020, writer John D'Anna did a good job of laying out Prescott's extremist roots in detail and helps to explain why no one should be surprised that it's a hotbed for bigoted right-wingers .\n\nThe town of Kingman (also in Gosar's district) is one of the locations where Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh coordinated his deadly 1995 massacre , and it has maintained its legacy of bigotry in the 21st century. As one former GOP operative told The New York Times about Kingman in 2022, \"This is the part of the country where they believe Timothy McVeigh was right.\" It was an acknowledgment that racist, anti-government conspiracies - McVeigh sold copies of \"The Turner Diaries\" at gun shows and called white nationalists his \"brothers in arms\" - continue to plague Kingman. It's a problem actor Sacha Baron Cohen even put under a microscope in his 2018 television series, \"Who is America?\"\n\nThese articles offer some valuable history for folks who want to understand how hate spreads, using the extremism documented in Northern Arizona as a guide. They show how a combination of permissive gun culture, rank racial resentment and opportunistic lawmakers can make for a toxic brew that engenders the kind of political violence that law enforcement appears to have foiled in Prescott - this time.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

      "text": "Desperate right-wingers accuse Tim Walz of being 'anti-white'\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nDonald Trump 's campaign and the conservative movement have been grasping at straws trying to tar Kamala Harris ' running mate, Tim Walz, since he joined her ticket this week.\n\nThey have revived previously debunked allegations downplaying Walz's 24 years of military service. And Trump has said Walz would \"unleash hell\" on the U.S. and denounced his handling as governor of Minnesota of the 2020 social justice protests - a claim that's undercut by recently unearthed audio in which Trump praised his handling of those protests.\n\nSo Republican influencers and media types are pushing another line of attack: claiming Walz secretly despises white people. Newsmax host Rob Schmitt, claiming to know Walz's true motivations, said on Wednesday that Walz has been eager to \"decimate the history of his own state to capitulate to a population of asylum-seekers in this country from Africa.\"\n\n\"Tim Walz is the white guy with a white wife and white kids who hates white people,\" Schmitt argued. \"That's who Tim Walz is. We all know a guy like that. He's the left-wing cancer that we can't seem to cure in this country. He is the embodiment of that.\"\n\nRight-wing activist Christopher Rufo posted a long thread on X suggesting that because Walz may have read Black authors, he's been inspired to \"exclude whites from government programs.\" That was a dubious characterization of Walz's commitment to distribute 50% of a government funding program to minority business owners. Rufo also retweeted a user who claimed Walz is a \"self-hating white man\" who's \"trying to be forgiven for his skin crime.\"\n\nAnd during a recent appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast, former Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota falsely claimed Walz signed a law that \"infused all the school curriculum with wokeism\" and mandated the teaching of what she called a \"George Floyd hate whitey curriculum.\" She added, \"Everything is about race. It's 'hate white people, white people are evil.' And that's in all of the curriculum.\" In reality, Walz signed a law this year that prohibited school libraries from banning a book \"based solely on its viewpoint or the messages, ideas, or opinions it conveys,\" a counter to Republican efforts to ban books about systemic racism and inequality. That law still allows schools to restrict access to books over \"legitimate\" concerns about appropriateness.\n\nThese are some of the scare tactics right-wing influencers and media are using, trying to portray a white man who's shown concern for marginalized people as some sort of menacing, anti-white race traitor. This is a tactic that's been deployed against white Americans who've opposed racism in the past . But aside from exposing those who make such claims as bigots, it also makes them look flat-out bizarre. As the Harris campaign continues to make the case to voters that its opponents are \" weird ,\" in plain speak, Republicans can't seem to resist embracing the toxic rhetoric of the darkest right-wing fringe.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

      "text": "GOP's new 'America First Caucus' follows in some blatantly white nationalist footsteps\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nA newly formed \"America First Caucus\" in Congress, supported by a few far-right Republicans in the House of Representatives, is looking to recruit new members with an old set of arguments.\n\nThese white nationalist tropes found a receptive audience in the American people.\n\nIts platform, now circulating in Washington, is little more than a retread of the white nationalist screeds of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n\"America is a nation with a border, and a culture, strengthened by a common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon traditions,\" asserts the section on immigration. \"History has shown that societal trust and political unity are threatened when foreign citizens are imported en-masse into a country.\"\n\nA century ago, these same sorts of arguments about the \"Anglo-Saxon\" character of the United States and the threat that \"foreign\" elements would bring to its politics and culture were quite widespread.\n\nDuring the late 1910s, as the United States reeled from a deadly pandemic, economic turmoil, race riots and a surge in immigration all at once, these white nationalist tropes found a receptive audience in the American people.\n\nBestselling books made the case. Madison Grant's 1916 \"The Passing of the Great Race\" complained about unwanted demographic changes in terms familiar to us today. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, he warned, were not reproducing children fast enough to keep pace with \"the Slovak, the Italian, the Syrian, and the Jew.\" Established \"old stock\" Americans, he grumbled , were \"being literally driven off the streets of New York City by the swarms of Polish Jews.\"\n\nIn the 1920 publication \"The Rising Tide of Color: The Threat Against White World Supremacy,\" Lothrop Stoddard made the same claims, warning that white Americans were being engulfed by the more \"fertile\" nonwhite races. Americans of \"Anglo-Saxon origin,\" he insisted , had to restrict immigration to preserve their country for \"future generations who have a right to demand of us that they shall be born white in a white man's land.\"\n\nThis popular panic over immigration helped revive the Ku Klux Klan, which pressed the issue aggressively in the early 1920s.\n\nMeanwhile, in the pages of the Saturday Evening Post, Kenneth Roberts spread the same sorts of arguments to a general audience. He too warned about Polish Jews, whom he sneered at as \"human parasites.\" Unrestricted immigration, he warned , would create a \"hybrid race of people as worthless and futile as the good-for-nothing mongrels of Central America and Southeastern Europe.\"\n\nThis popular panic over immigration helped revive the Ku Klux Klan, which pressed the issue aggressively in the early 1920s.\n\nThe Klan's imperial wizard warned in 1922 about \"the tremendous influx of foreign immigration, tutored in alien dogmas and alien creeds, slowly pushing the native-born white American population into the center of the country, there to be ultimately overwhelmed and smothered.\" In 1923, a meeting of grand dragons of the Klan focused a great deal on the supposed threat, asserting that the only true American was \"one whose every thought and interest places America first above all other nations on Earth.\"\n\nThe popular panic over immigration and the pseudo-scientific justifications for nativism and racism came together in the push for the National Origins Act of 1924, a quota-based measure that drastically reduced immigration from southeastern Europe and banned all Asians from immigrating entirely.\n\nIn the congressional debate, Sen. Ellison \"Cotton Ed\" Smith, a South Carolina Democrat and a prominent segregationist, urged his colleagues to read the arguments Grant and others had made and to heed their warnings.\n\n\"Thank God we have in America perhaps the largest percentage of any country in the world of the pure, unadulterated Anglo-Saxon stock; certainly the greatest of any nation in the Nordic breed. It is for the preservation of that splendid stock,\" he said , that immigration restrictions were vitally needed.\n\nSuch arguments carried the day. The National Origins Act was passed by overwhelming margins in both houses of Congress, with equally strong support from both parties. President Calvin Coolidge then signed the measure into law, marking a significant turning point in American history.\n\nFor centuries, people from all over the globe had rushed to the New World to find their freedom, their fortune or a bit of both. The new restrictions changed that, closing the door to the United States and all it had been thought to represent.\n\nThe popular panic over immigration and the pseudo-scientific justifications for nativism and racism came together in the push for the National Origins Act of 1924.\n\nBut the white nationalist panic in America did more than change its own immigration policy. As historian James Q. Whitman and others have chronicled, the National Origins Act in turn served as a model for the \"racial citizenship\" laws that took root in Germany a decade later.\n\n\"The United States of the new world have come to understand the monstrous danger of the 'great melting pot of races' over the course of the last decades, and put a check on bastardization through draconian immigration law,\" a Nazi Party publication noted in 1933. \"To these circles of tribally related Americans we reach out our hand in friendship.\"\n\nAmerica's immigration restriction, along with the segregation statutes in the South, ultimately stood as the inspiration for the 1935 Nuremberg Laws . And those laws, in turn, provided Germans with the legal justification for the Holocaust itself.\n\nHistory isn't predictive, of course. But if the America First Caucus wants to argue what history has shown us, then let's not ignore what it has shown us about their own arguments. We need to remember the dangerous ends and drastic horrors such arguments led us to before and might well lead us to again.\n\nKevin M. Kruse is a professor of history at Princeton University.

      "text": "I Wanted to Know What White Men Thought About Their Privilege. So I Asked.\n\nFeature\n\nMy college class asks what it means to be white in America - but interrogating that question as a black woman in the real world is much harder to do.\n\nCredit... Photo illustration by Najeebah Al-Ghadban\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Claudia Rankine\n\nI n the early days of the run-up to the 2016 election, I was just beginning to prepare a class on whiteness to teach at Yale University, where I had been newly hired. Over the years, I had come to realize that I often did not share historical knowledge with the persons to whom I was speaking. \"What's redlining?\" someone would ask. \"George Washington freed his slaves?\" someone else would inquire. But as I listened to Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign that spring, the class took on a new dimension. Would my students understand the long history that informed a comment like one Trump made when he announced his presidential candidacy? \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" he said. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" When I heard those words, I wanted my students to track immigration laws in the United States. Would they connect the treatment of the undocumented with the treatment of Irish, Italian and Asian people over the centuries?\n\nIn preparation, I needed to slowly unpack and understand how whiteness was created. How did the Naturalization Act of 1790, which restricted citizenship to \"any alien, being a free white person,\" develop over the years into our various immigration acts? What has it taken to cleave citizenship from \"free white person\"? What was the trajectory of the Ku Klux Klan after its formation at the end of the Civil War, and what was its relationship to the Black Codes, those laws subsequently passed in Southern states to restrict black people's freedoms? Did the United States government bomb the black community in Tulsa, Okla., in 1921? How did Italians, Irish and Slavic peoples become white? Why do people believe abolitionists could not be racist?\n\nI wanted my students to gain an awareness of a growing body of work by sociologists, theorists, historians and literary scholars in a field known as \"whiteness studies,\" the cornerstones of which include Toni Morrison's \"Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination,\" David Roediger's \"The Wages of Whiteness,\" Matthew Frye Jacobson's \"Whiteness of a Different Color: European Immigrants and the Alchemy of Race,\" Richard Dyer's \"White\" and more recently Nell Irvin Painter's \"The History of White People.\" Roediger, a historian, had explained the development of the field, one that my class would engage with, saying, \"The 1980s and early '90s saw the publication of major works on white identity's intricacies and costs by James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, alongside new works by white writers and activists asking similar questions historically. Given the seeming novelty of such white writing and the urgency of understanding white support for Ronald Reagan, 'critical whiteness studies' gained media attention and a small foothold in universities.\" This area of study aimed to make visible a history of whiteness that through its association with \"normalcy\" and \"universality\" masked its omnipresent institutional power.\n\nMy class eventually became Constructions of Whiteness, and over the two years that I have taught it, many of my students (who have included just about every race, gender identity and sexual orientation) interviewed white people on campus or in their families about their understanding of American history and how it relates to whiteness. Some students simply wanted to know how others around them would define their own whiteness. Others were troubled by their own family members' racism and wanted to understand how and why certain prejudices formed. Still others wanted to show the impact of white expectations on their lives.\n\nPerhaps this is why one day in New Haven, staring into the semicircle of oak trees in my backyard, I wondered what it would mean to ask random white men how they understood their privilege. I imagined myself - a middle-aged black woman - walking up to strangers and doing so. Would they react as the police captain in Plainfield, Ind., did when his female colleague told him during a diversity-training session that he benefited from \"white male privilege\"? He became angry and accused her of using a racialized slur against him. ( She was placed on paid administrative leave , and a reprimand was placed permanently in her file.) Would I, too, be accused? Would I hear myself asking about white male privilege and then watch white man after white man walk away as if I were mute? Would they think I worked for Trevor Noah or Stephen Colbert and just forgot my camera crew? The running comment in our current political climate is that we all need to converse with people we don't normally speak to, and though my husband is white, I found myself falling into easy banter with all kinds of strangers except white men. They rarely sought me out to shoot the breeze, and I did not seek them out. Maybe it was time to engage, even if my fantasies of these encounters seemed outlandish. I wanted to try.\n\nWeeks later, it occurred to me that I tend to be surrounded by white men I don't know when I'm traveling, caught in places that are essentially nowhere: in between, en route, up in the air. As I crisscrossed the United States, Europe and Africa giving talks about my work, I found myself considering these white men who passed hours with me in airport lounges, at gates, on planes. They seemed to me to make up the largest percentage of business travelers in the liminal spaces where we waited. That I was among them in airport lounges and in first-class cabins spoke in part to my own relative economic privilege, but the price of my ticket, of course, does not translate into social capital. I was always aware that my value in our culture's eyes is determined by my skin color first and foremost. Maybe these other male travelers could answer my questions about white privilege. I felt certain that as a black woman, there had to be something I didn't understand.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "As a White Man, Can I Date Women of Color to Advance My Antiracism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscriber-only Newsletter\n\nThe magazine's Ethicist columnist on interracial dating as a sociopolitical strategy.\n\nBy Kwame Anthony Appiah\n\nI'm a straight white dude and recent college grad who has very progressive beliefs and is looking for a committed partner who, in time, can equitably raise a family with me. I have almost zero honest-to-goodness physical preferences. I've dated women of various shapes and sizes, various skin, hair and eye colors, etc., and have been attracted to all of them.\n\nHere's what's controversial among my friends: I want to prioritize dating women of color. I'm after a cross-cultural relationship. I believe very strongly that one of the main ways to combat racism is through relationships. Part of me thinks that I will always be somewhat disappointed if what ends up becoming one of the most important relationships in my life is with another white person. If someone is a woman of color, that checks a box for me in a real way. I am seeking to be antiracist in all my relationships.\n\nPart of the reason that I prioritize it is to combat implicit bias, having grown up in a fairly white, quasi rural place. I am dedicated to educating myself on issues of racism, sexism and other forms of kyriarchy while also learning from marginalized people. For me, principles lead the way to attractions. I start by eating a food or adopting a habit because it's good for me, and after trying it enough times, I find I really like it for what it is. The same applies to people I'm considering dating.\n\nBoth I and my hypothetical partner of color would be choosing more learning and less comfort, to put forth greater effort and practice more listening, than we otherwise would in a culturally homogeneous committed relationship. And one of the main ways that I hope to combat racism individually is by leveraging my own privilege (economic, family connections, education) for people of color, including any biracial children we bring into this world. Here's my question: Despite my well-meaning antiracist principles, is this preference (as friends have suggested) wrong, insensitive or somehow itself racist? - Name Withheld\n\nFrom the Ethicist:\n\nYour devotion to self-improvement is impressive. Like a dish of quinoa and kale that you may once have forced down and now actively enjoy, a woman of color could, you think, raise your game, supplying something like antiracist roughage. You'd be using your erotic ecumenism to level up. Where your shallower classmates have hookups, your dates would be teach-ins. ''Do the work,'' the slogan urges, and you're rolling up your sleeves.\n\nA few cautions. You may be a little hasty in conflating ''interracial'' with ''cross- cultural''; it sounds as if you'd prefer to make a life with someone who basically shares your values and doesn't have to Google words like ''kyriarchy.'' (I see that it's a coinage by the feminist theologian Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza to designate interconnected systems of domination on the basis of gender, race, religion and other identities.) And then treating a relationship like a seminar can lead to trouble: What happens when you've finished your fieldwork, read through the syllabus and are ready for a new instructor? If the model is, instead, a healthful dietary regimen, will you allow yourself cheat days?\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "I'm a White Man. Hear Me Out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Frank Bruni\n\nI'm a white man, so you should listen to absolutely nothing I say, at least on matters of social justice. I have no standing. No way to relate. My color and gender nullify me, and it gets worse: I grew up in the suburbs. Dad made six figures. We had a backyard pool. From the 10th through 12th grades, I attended private school. So the only proper way for me to check my privilege is to realize that it blinds me to others' struggles and should gag me during discussions about the right responses to them.\n\nBut wait. I'm gay. And I mean gay from a different, darker day. In that pool and at that school, I sometimes quaked inside, fearful of what my future held. Back then - the 1970s - gay stereotypes went unchallenged, gay jokes drew hearty laughter and exponentially more Americans were closeted than out. We conducted our lives in whispers. Then AIDS spread, and we wore scarlet letters as we marched into the public square to plead with President Ronald Reagan for help. Our rallying cry, \"silence = death,\" defined marginalization as well as any words could.\n\nSo where does that leave me? Who does that make me? Oppressor or oppressed? Villain or victim? And does my legitimacy hinge on the answer?\n\nTo listen to some of the guardians of purity on the left, yes.\n\nNot long ago I wrote about Evergreen State College, which was roiled by protests after a white biology professor, Bret Weinstein, disparaged the particular tack of a day of racial healing. He raised valid points, only to be branded a bigot and threatened with violence.\n\nThat reception was wrong. I said so. And a reader responded: \"I don't need one more white male criticizing young people of color.\" Other readers also homed in on my race - or on the professor's: \"Weinstein will be fine. He's white.\" That automatically and axiomatically made him a less compelling actor in the drama, a less deserving object of concern, no matter his actions, no matter his argument.\n\nMark Lilla, a Columbia University professor, got a big, bitter taste of this late last year when he wrote, in The Times, about the presidential election and \"identity politics,\" which, he argued, had hurt the Democratic Party. He maintained that too intense a focus on each minority group's discrete persecution comes at the expense of a larger, unifying vision.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "When White People Become People of Color\n\nWhat to Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nFiction\n\nIn Mohsin Hamid's new novel, \"The Last White Man,\" the white protagonist awakes to find he has turned brown.\n\nBy David Gates\n\nWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\n\nTHE LAST WHITE MAN, by Mohsin Hamid\n\nThe opening sentence of \"The Last White Man,\" the latest novel by the Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid, may sound overfamiliar - \"One morning Anders, a white man, woke up to find he had turned a deep and undeniable brown\" - but who wouldn't read on? A protagonist as erudite as his creator might have been grateful not to turn into a giant bug; Anders, who works in a gym and seems as aliterate as he is inarticulate, feels only rage at losing his whiteness: \"He wanted to kill the colored man who confronted him here in his home, to extinguish the life animating this other's body, to leave nothing standing but himself, as he was before.\" But the self-divided Anders - could he have a more Nordic name? - calms down when he learns there's a pandemic of changelings; the formerly white come to include his yoga-teacher girlfriend, Oona; Oona's racist mother; and, eventually, everybody who was born white. (All except Anders's dying father, a secondary character who gives the book its catchy, if misleading, title.) By the end, a pulp-magazine premise has metamorphosed into a vision of humanity unvexed by racial animosities.\n\nIn a 2017 essay in The Guardian, Hamid called for a \"radical, politically engaged fiction\" that would \"peer with all the madness and insight and unexpectedness and wisdom we can muster into where we might desirably go, as individuals, families, societies, cultures, nations, earthlings, organisms.\" Or, as he puts it in a note to readers in the new book's advance copies, \"I believe fiction has a strange power ... that enables it to destabilize the collective imaginings we inherit and reproduce.\" Our imaginings certainly could use some destabilizing, although literary fiction hardly has the transformative clout its practitioners wish it had. Hamid's likely readers already know race is a \"construct\" that we could do nicely without; the unenlightened many (the enlightened too) are streaming movies and TV shows. But whether deliberately or not - and Hamid's too smart a writer not to know what he's doing - \"The Last White Man\" has an additional agenda: to destabilize not just our toxic imaginings but our conventional notions of fiction itself.\n\nIn a better world, people wouldn't always be at each other's throats, yet fiction traditionally thrives on conflict and tension - to \"thrive\" meaning, first of all, to keep the reader reading. There's something inherently cheesy about even the most august canonical novels, with their crankings-up of distress and danger and suspense before a tragic or a comic denouement. No matter what slow torments the writer inflicts on us (and on the characters), we know that eventually Elizabeth's going to get Mr. Darcy and the whale's going to get Ahab - just as we know that James Bond will disarm the doomsday bomb at the last tick of the timer. As sublime and ennobling as fiction can be, it's a game that reader and writer consent to play together: The writer pretends not to be in control of what happens next, while the reader revels in vicarious anguish. Aristotle thought of this process as pity and fear \"effecting the proper purgation of these emotions\"; philistines call it entertainment. But Hamid's earnest pronouncements suggest that he wants a different kind of fiction, without artifice or manipulation - fiction that behaves as straightforwardly as a right-thinking person behaves. Why work up all that pity and fear when they just need to go away?\n\nIn his first three novels, though, Hamid played the game like a champ. To our shame, I guess, crime, violence, adultery and general human cussedness hold a reader's attention; so do idiosyncratic characters, and a narrative in which one event builds up to the next. (Heck, let's be vulgar: I couldn't put any of these books down.) And these conventional pleasures come packaged in pleasingly unconventional forms. \"Moth Smoke\" (2000) has multiple narrators, one of whom directly addresses the judge at the protagonist's murder trial. \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\" (2007), entirely spoken by a garrulous man to a shifty stranger in a cafe, gradually shades into a thriller. And \"How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia\" (2013), as the title suggests, tells a rags-to-riches-to-downfall story under the guise of a self-help book. A tired device? Not with Hamid's intrusive and ironic narrator, who mocks both his ostensible genre and what he calls \"that much-praised, breathtakingly boring foreign novel\" with \"page after page after please-make-it-stop page of tar-slow prose.\" It's a cheeky manifesto against earnestness.\n\nBut with \"Exit West\" (2017), Hamid chucks such playfulness for flat-footed fabulism: Residents of an unspecified country magically escape civil war through mysterious doors, join migrant communities in London, then in California, where - surprise! - nothing all that bad happens. And now, in \"The Last White Man,\" his newfound inclination to spare characters any serious trouble rises to an aesthetic principle; the renunciation of the tension that powered his earlier novels seems penitential. In the most dramatic episode, Anders confronts armed men at his door, they leave, he flees and ... they're never seen again. In a more typical scene, Anders drives to visit Oona, feels a sense of menace, \"and nothing happened and then he was there.\" Oona takes a drive too: A police car pulls up next to her, she smiles and looks away - and again nothing happens. Anders and Oona go for a walk: It's chilly, \"but they were dressed appropriately ... and it was not so bad at all.\" They talk. Then a truck rumbles over a pothole. (That's all about the truck.) Then they come upon some schoolboys skipping stones in a stream, \"but no stone hit them, or came particularly close ... and Anders gazed straight ahead.\" (That's all about the schoolboys. End of episode.) The characters in \"The Last White Man\" do plenty of \"gazing,\" along with \"wondering\" and \"realizing,\" but they don't do much doing , nor does anyone do much to them. Toward the end of the novel, we learn that Anders and Oona have had a daughter, that all the white people have turned brown and that life is, you might say, not so bad at all. Granted, this is where we earthlings and organisms might desirably go - it sure beats where we are - but is it what we might desirably read?\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Blow\n\nI guess Donald Trump was eager to counter the impression in Michael Wolff's book that he is irascible, mentally small and possibly insane. On Tuesday, he allowed a bipartisan session in the White House about immigration to be televised for nearly an hour.\n\nSurely, he thought that he would be able to demonstrate to the world his lucidity and acumen, his grasp of the issues and his relish for rapprochement with his political adversaries.\n\nBut instead what came through was the image of a man who had absolutely no idea what he was talking about; a man who says things that are 180 degrees from the things he has said before; a man who has no clear line of reasoning; a man who is clearly out of his depth and willing to do and say anything to please the people in front of him.\n\nHe demonstrated once again that he is a man without principle, interested only in how good he can make himself look and how much money he can make.\n\nYes, he has an intrinsic hostility to people who are not white, particularly when they challenge him, but as a matter of policy, the whole idea of building a wall for which Mexico would pay was just a cheap campaign stunt to, once again, please the people in front of him.\n\nTrump is not committed to that wall on principle. He is committed only to looking good as a result of whatever comes of it. Mexico is never going to pay for it, and he knows it. He has always known it. That was just another lie. Someone must have stuck the phrases \"chain migration\" and \"diversity lottery\" into his brain - easy buzzwords, you see - and he can now rail against those ideas for applause lines.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Lingering Frustration of a White Man Winning the Presidency, Again\n\nJoe Biden has finally won the election. After several tense days of fluctuating leads, armed pro-Trump protesters , and one state's late-breaking realization that people cared about the outcome of this race, it is an immense relief to know that if all goes according to the rule of law, the Trump administration will no longer be in power on Jan. 21, 2021.\n\nFor me, this profound gratitude is accompanied by a faint twinge of sadness. Yes, Biden's win is without question the optimal result: Getting Donald Trump out of the White House was essential, and we will still be calculating the damages of his presidency for some time. With or without a Democratic Senate majority, Biden will be a fine president. But this election week has resurfaced all my memories of the last presidential election, which offered the possibility of the country's first female president. Sure, Kamala Harris was on the winning ticket this year, and her vice presidency will be historic. And yet, there is still a bitter aftertaste to the knowledge that, several months after the most diverse presidential primary the U.S. has ever seen, the final result is that another white man will be president.\n\nThere are a lot of specific features of Joe Biden that contribute to this kernel of disappointment sitting at the center of my relief. His platform is far from transformative. His campaign seemed to excite more voters as a harm-reduction measure, a least-common-denominator electability threat to Trump, rather than as a stand-alone proposition. If the Democrats don't gain control of both branches of Congress, it will be nearly impossible for them to enact any meaningful part of their agenda-and, anyway, Biden is already talking about building bridges with the party of stolen court seats and voter suppression. He is also extremely old and visibly losing steam.\n\nBut on a broader level, the knowledge that Biden could beat Trump while Hillary Clinton-a leader at least as vital and decent and capable as Biden-couldn't will always sting. The memory of U.S. voters, via the Electoral College, choosing a hateful, proudly incompetent man over an intelligent, competent woman will never go away. And the fact that many Democratic primary voters chose Biden because a racist and sexist president convinced them that Americans were too racist and sexist to accept anyone but a white man will anger me for a long, long time.\n\nAfter election night, as it became clear that, despite record turnout for Biden, this wasn't going to be a landslide repudiation of Trump, some wondered whether Clinton had been unfairly maligned as a uniquely despisable nominee, especially since more than 8 million more people cast votes for Trump against Biden than against her. But I'm not here to rehash the specifics of the 2016 election: what Clinton did wrong, what Trump did right, why she's best understood as a bad candidate and not as a female candidate, or whether, given Biden's performance, she wasn't all that bad after all. And I'm not here to speculate on whether Biden was truly the most electable candidate, the only Democrat who could possibly win by drawing racist white voters away from Trump. I've already done that too. I am here to express my frustration with the enduring racism and sexism of the American electorate, and to give voice to my precious hope that Trump's calamitous presidency, even though it was ultimately ended by Biden, doesn't doom the Democratic Party to another generation of white male presidential candidates.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nAs it happens, white men are a small minority of Democratic voters. Around 40 percent of Democratic voters are people of color; 56 percent are women. The extent to which white men are overrepresented among Democratic elected officials, in relation to the party's rank-and-file makeup, is an absolute outrage. This is not an argument for gender or race essentialism. Women and people of color can indeed have bad politics. Newly minted Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett wants the government to force women to give birth against their will. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Black Republican, has gone out of his way to protect the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor. On the flip side, as many have pointed out, Sen. Bernie Sanders is an elderly white man whose politics would improve the lives of people who aren't white men. There are plenty of exceptions. But I might point out, as the makeup of Trump's base reminds us, everyone else's politics are less bad, on average, than white men's.\n\nThis complex reality does not change the fact that bigotry, however ambiguously it manifests in voters' perceptions and preferences, are depriving us of the opportunity to draw from a full roster of political talent. In a country in which two-thirds of voters do not believe their \"neighbors\" would be comfortable with a woman in the Oval Office, the horizons of political possibility are truncated. Biden's win is a demoralizing reminder that in the year 2020, there are certain positions of power women still can't get-that even as women lead formidable political movements, define entire schools of jurisprudence, write game-changing public policy, make a swing state out of Georgia , bring their expertise to high-level Cabinet positions, and direct some of the country's most powerful political advocacy groups, voters still do not trust them with the presidency.\n\nI know, #NotAllVoters. A woman won the majority of presidential votes in 2016. But the fact that more than 71 million people voted for the multiply accused sexual assailant who dreams of punishment for abortion patients and recently told women (\" housewives \") they should be glad he was \" getting your husbands back to work \" suggests that there may be some sexism afoot here in the ol' American electorate. It's obviously present in the GOP, but it's not confined to any party. You don't have to look too hard to find evidence that Biden's gender and race gave him an unearned advantage in both the primary and general elections: There were those Sanders-landslide counties that abandoned Sanders and delivered Biden landslides this year (I guess Clinton's centrist politics weren't the problem?). There was the way that Democratic voters who exhibited more \"hostile sexism\" were more likely to support Biden or Sanders than Elizabeth Warren. There's the fact that anti-Black \"racial resentment\" was a stronger predictor of voter support for Biden than any positions on policy issues during the primary. And, of course, there's the 2016 Jill Stein voter from Ohio who's voting Biden this time because \"I thought the girl \"-73-year-old former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton-\"just wanted the job because she wanted to be the boss.\"\n\nLike any institution infected with racism and sexism, our democracy suffers dearly for it. While women and people of color seeking office work harder and amass more qualifications to surmount their higher barriers to entry, mediocre white male candidates with inflated senses of self clog up the pipelines. Cal Cunningham, a Democrat who looks unlikely to unseat Sen. Thom Tillis in North Carolina, beat out several Democrats, including progressive state Sen. Erica Smith , to win the nomination earlier this year, in large part because he had the full support of the party establishment. He has also been having a stupid secret sexual affair that damaged his favorability ratings when it was revealed in October (he is married). The affair also threatened his strong polling lead in a state Democrats probably need to win to gain control of the Senate, and with 95 percent of votes counted in North Carolina, Cunningham has slightly underperformed Biden. Cunningham is one of a long line of white men whose sexist behavior, racist actions, and/or selfish sexual indiscretions have threatened their party's ability to retain political power. In 2016, I wrote that Anthony Weiner and Bill Clinton had \"prioritized their own sexual proclivities over their wives' careers and ambitions,\" which helped land America with a Trump presidency in the first place. Let us also not forget Ralph Northam, Al Franken, John Edwards, and Gary Hart.\n\nThere's a pattern here. You know who is a lot less likely to have blackface and KKK cosplay in their past? Candidates of color. Guess who's orders of magnitude less likely to have sexually harassed people, demeaned women with unwanted hugs , or imperiled their political careers with an embarrassing secret affair ? A female candidate! But white men, even those who take their responsibilities to supporters and constituents so unseriously that they risk it all for a few laughs, keep rising to the top. They win, in part, because the racism and sexism of the U.S. electorate makes it a lot easier for them. And women and people of color, who make up the majority of the Democratic Party, turn out to support them because the alternative is so much worse.\n\nEquitable representation in politics isn't everything. It's not just about boys touching Barack Obama's hair , or girls pinkie-promising Warren that they'll always remember that they can run for president too-though it is a little bit about that. But it's also about getting the best candidates possible in line for the job. In our democracy, diversity cannot be implemented from the top down-unlike some countries, we don't have electoral quotas for women and religious or ethnic minorities. In U.S. politics, the only way to get our elected officials to look more like the populations they serve is to make voters less sexist and racist.\n\nWhat I am worried about is that even as the lower ranks of the Democratic Party diversify, what we will learn from the Trump years-and from this race, which was closer than it should have been, given Trump's disastrous tenure-is that the stakes are too high to risk the presidency. Warren had barely announced her exploratory committee when Democratic power players started calling her \"too unlikable,\" too \"cold\" and \"aloof.\" They boasted that Biden was an easier sell because \" he's an old white guy .\" It's hard to imagine a near future, after Trump, in which Democrats find themselves willing to boost the presidential candidacy of someone who isn't a white man, whether it's because they're bigoted, or because they're cowardly and willing to preemptively cave to others' bigotry. The imaginary all-important swing voter will always be the racist, sexist white man who can be seduced by the likes of Trump rather than the young, Black nonvoter who doesn't see herself in the Democrats' leadership or policy priorities (or whose vote is deliberately suppressed).\n\nEven as I celebrate the end of the Trump administration with my entire being, I'm still thinking about four years ago, when American voters had the chance to prevent the irreparable damage that was to come, and declined because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for a woman. That some of those people decided they could stomach Biden, and were motivated to turn out in record numbers for him, can't undo the catastrophic damage Trump's tenure has done. Yet the Democratic Party's bounds of possibility will continue to be tailored to those voters, whose bad politics deserve no tailoring. This was always going to be the way Biden won, and he knew it. In January, as he courted primary voters, Biden assured Iowans that while Clinton faced \"unfair\" sexist attacks from the right, \" That's not going to happen with me .\" Lo and behold, he was right.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Guess who's orders of magnitude less likely to have sexually harassed people, demeaned women with unwanted hugs , or imperiled their political careers with an embarrassing secret affair ? A female candidate! But white men, even those who take their responsibilities to supporters and constituents so unseriously that they risk it all for a few laughs, keep rising to the top. They win, in part, because the racism and sexism of the U.S. electorate makes it a lot easier for them. And women and people of color, who make up the majority of the Democratic Party, turn out to support them because the alternative is so much worse.\n\nEquitable representation in politics isn't everything. It's not just about boys touching Barack Obama's hair , or girls pinkie-promising Warren that they'll always remember that they can run for president too-though it is a little bit about that. But it's also about getting the best candidates possible in line for the job. In our democracy, diversity cannot be implemented from the top down-unlike some countries, we don't have electoral quotas for women and religious or ethnic minorities. In U.S. politics, the only way to get our elected officials to look more like the populations they serve is to make voters less sexist and racist.\n\nWhat I am worried about is that even as the lower ranks of the Democratic Party diversify, what we will learn from the Trump years-and from this race, which was closer than it should have been, given Trump's disastrous tenure-is that the stakes are too high to risk the presidency. Warren had barely announced her exploratory committee when Democratic power players started calling her \"too unlikable,\" too \"cold\" and \"aloof.\" They boasted that Biden was an easier sell because \" he's an old white guy .\" It's hard to imagine a near future, after Trump, in which Democrats find themselves willing to boost the presidential candidacy of someone who isn't a white man, whether it's because they're bigoted, or because they're cowardly and willing to preemptively cave to others' bigotry. The imaginary all-important swing voter will always be the racist, sexist white man who can be seduced by the likes of Trump rather than the young, Black nonvoter who doesn't see herself in the Democrats' leadership or policy priorities (or whose vote is deliberately suppressed).\n\nEven as I celebrate the end of the Trump administration with my entire being, I'm still thinking about four years ago, when American voters had the chance to prevent the irreparable damage that was to come, and declined because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for a woman. That some of those people decided they could stomach Biden, and were motivated to turn out in record numbers for him, can't undo the catastrophic damage Trump's tenure has done. Yet the Democratic Party's bounds of possibility will continue to be tailored to those voters, whose bad politics deserve no tailoring. This was always going to be the way Biden won, and he knew it. In January, as he courted primary voters, Biden assured Iowans that while Clinton faced \"unfair\" sexist attacks from the right, \" That's not going to happen with me .\" Lo and behold, he was right.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Help! My Daughter Is Marrying a White Man Against My Wishes.\n\nDear Prudence is Slate's advice column. Submit questions here. (It's anonymous!)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nRecently, I learned that my adult daughter was getting married within the year. I was surprised to learn this because I knew nothing of her dating anyone, let alone seriously enough that marriage was in the near future. I'll admit my daughter and I are not as close as we could be, not since her mother and I divorced when she was a preteen and I moved out of state. Our contact was more limited after I remarried, but I still thought she would inform me of her beau. I arranged a trip to go visit her and see him in person. I was taken aback to learn her fiancé is a white man; she is black. I didn't say anything at the time, but after I left and thought about it, I felt I should talk to her about it. While the man seemed nice enough, I felt she didn't know what she was getting herself into.\n\nI gave her a call and expressed my concerns, trying to make sure I wasn't being judgmental. However, my daughter became angry and argued it wasn't my business since I'm not a part of her life. She also said that if I didn't agree with this, she could comment on my marrying a younger woman while forgetting about her growing up. She hung up and later sent a text telling me that I was perfectly free to skip the wedding if I felt so strongly about it. She even went as far as to say that if I had been a better example of a black man, she might not have gone for my \"physical opposite.\" Honestly, I largely don't want to go to the wedding not only because I don't approve of the relationship but her disrespectful attitude. I'm worried that if I don't, though, it'll solidify a strained relationship. What should I do?\n\n- Hurt but Concerned\n\nDear Hurt,\n\nMy advice boils down to this: Stay in your lane. And the name of the lane is: Absentee father.\n\nA lot of people would say one of the problems here is that you care about her fiancé's race at all. But I don't agree. I can see a Black father who is close to his daughter reasonably saying, \"Oh wow, he's white? Just checking, how does he feel about raising Black children? Have you two talked about what you'll do when racism inevitably rears its head in your lives? What has he said about how his relatives will treat you?\" In that sense, I don't think it's totally inappropriate to express concern. But it's a weird thing to do if you haven't shown the same kind of care about other issues in your daughter's life. I also think it's strange that you brought it up after having a chance to meet the guy, feel out his vibes, ask him questions and get to know who he was as a whole person, not just a white person. Taking all that together, I'm not at all surprised that she's upset by the combination of your absence in your life (which has obviously hurt her) and your misguided comments.\n\nI have to add that I also find it off-putting that as soon as you found out there was a man in her life, you hopped on a plane, especially if you didn't do the same when she started college, got her first job, moved into an apartment, or celebrated other milestones when she might have appreciated your presence. To suddenly perk up and engage when marriage is on the table suggests a sense of ownership rather than a true interest in her wellbeing.\n\nThe way forward is to apologize for overstepping and assure her that you would love to attend the wedding if she can forgive you. If she accepts, ask yourself if you can be comfortable with a role in her wedding that matches the role you've had in her life so far: Someone who's happy for her but isn't one of the main characters in her story and isn't entitled to a say about how things happen. The more you can be present, supportive, and nonjudgmental and refrain from being controlling, the more likely she is to open up to a closer relationship in the future. And if there are grandkids, you can have a fresh start.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nLast summer, COVID forced my stepsister and her fiancée to cancel their big beach wedding for a smaller ceremony and reception open only to immediate family and their closest friends. I went, and despite the masks and social distancing, I had a great time. They're planning to hold a vow renewal ceremony at the original venue this October and inviting both people who had missed the cut for the first wedding and those of us who got to attend the original incarnation. They're very nice people, and I'm sure I'd have a good time at the redux reception, but is it OK if I don't go, considering I was there for the actual wedding?\n\nThe event is taking place two and a half hours away from me, during my last semester of grad school, and on a Sunday, which will make getting home in time for work/school a hassle. There are obviously people in my life for whom I would have no choice but to go, but even though the couple in question is very nice, we've never been especially close (we're not even officially stepsiblings-our parents aren't married to each other and didn't get together until well after we both had left home), and I wonder if being asked to make an hours-long trek, during what may be a very busy time for me, and with only two months' notice (I haven't even gotten a save the date yet!) might be enough grounds for me to sit this one out. Am I being reasonable or am I being a jerk?\n\n- Perpetual Wedding Guest\n\nDear Wedding Guest,\n\nTotally reasonable. There's no established etiquette for the whole \"second real wedding after a first small pandemic wedding\" thing because it's all so new, but celebrating a marriage once is enough. I'm sure they'll understand, and it's even possible this is exactly what they expected but they invited people who were at the first event so they wouldn't feel rude. Send your regrets to your stepsister and throw in an effusive social media post on the big day.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy sister is not a good person: a woman in her 40s with older children she neglects; in and out of jail, probation violations and a drug addiction; stolen things to sell for drugs (her children's belongings, my deceased grandmother's jewelry, my pain meds from when I had a C-section); manipulates, lies, and ignores us until she needs money. She only ever contacts me to ask me for money. Always. Never anything else. But my parents love her all the same, and let her live in an apartment my father owns even though she doesn't pay rent on time or any of the bills, and it falls on my parents to keep it up. They always get her out of trouble no matter the cost, and I did too at one point, until I stopped letting her take advantage of me and stopped returning her phone calls.\n\nMy parents have gotten ill because they worry for her, and she has damaged her already weak immune system with drugs so much that now she's hospitalized and she may not make it. My parents are beside themselves but ... I feel indifferent. I only care about their health if she does pass. My father suffered a mild stroke from the stress at one point in time. My mother has become depressed since my sister was admitted. My mother wants me to reconcile, but I just can't. I distanced myself from my sister a long time ago and prepared myself for the inevitable. The logical answer is if she's going to pass, what harm is there to tell her I love her? But ... I can't even bring myself to pick up the phone to call. Do I fake it for my parents sake? And if she doesn't pass-I don't want to give her the impression I want her in my life again.\n\n- Not My Sister's Keeper\n\nDear Not My Sister's Keeper,\n\nEverything you've described sounds like a direct consequence of her drug addiction. Can you separate who she is from what the drugs made her do? Maybe reading up on the impact of drug abuse and the stories of people who have struggled with it might help you see that what she's done to you is not personal and not what she would have done if she were sober. That doesn't mean you'd ever be obligated to put up with it, of course. But she can't really harm you now. Picture the person she was before she ever used drugs, and if you love that person, go and tell her.\n\nCatch up on this week's Prudie.\n\nMy husband took out a personal loan of about $1,200 to buy an item that no one else is able to benefit from except himself. He already has several loans that could've been paid off by now, but chooses to pay the bare minimum.

      "text": "White Lies\n\nListen to A Word ... With Jason Johnson:\n\n\"I'm not racist\": Many self-proclaimed white allies say this to shut down conversations about how racism affects our society. Black people have been calling BS forever, but Robin DiAngelo, author of the 2018 bestseller White Fragility , has emerged as the leading white voice on the issue. The book gained a whole new audience during the so-called racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd last year. DiAngelo is now arguably the most prominent white voice calling for white people to be held accountable for racism. She has made it her mission to demand that white people face their role in perpetuating and benefiting from racism.\n\nDiAngelo and I recently spoke as part of the Crosscut Festival, an online conference that took a hard look at the people, policy, and events that shape our lives. On Friday's episode of A Word, we shared a portion of that conversation. I started by asking her whether she was surprised that Derek Chauvin was convicted on all counts in the murder of George Floyd. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nRobin DiAngelo: I was surprised that he was found guilty on all three accounts, just because watching the trial, it seems absolutely undeniable and indisputable that he's guilty on all three accounts, [but] based on the history of our criminal justice system...I didn't expect that to come through on all accounts. Symbolically, it is profound and of profound importance, but as Carol Anderson so powerfully argues using White Rage , every inch of racial progress has been met by a white backlash. We can see at the same time those forces growing really strongly. It is a potential beginning, but if we relax around it, that's all it will be, I think.\n\nJason Johnson: So the day of the ruling, my first reaction is I was not surprised and I wasn't particularly happy. I had long predicted that Derek Chauvin was going to be found guilty and the reason why is because I felt like white supremacy in America occasionally has its sacrificial lambs. How do you respond to that take, that it's like, \"Well, of course, the system will get rid of this one bad guy after a year of protest,\" but does it speak to the fact that we may see changes when it comes to the other officers being held accountable? Or the half a dozen other shootings that we've seen just during the two or three weeks of the trial?\n\nYeah, well, all systems of oppression can accommodate exceptions, but the rule will remain consistent and the exceptions will be used to negate the rule. We saw that during Obama's presidency: ' We're post-racial now .' It was actually harder for me to do my work during Obama's presidency than it is today because I don't think anybody is in denial that we are so not post-racial. Not only could the system accommodate that exception, but it gave it an infusion of racism, an infusion of explicit racism. It got more legitimacy to express than it had before. We're going to have to be really careful as always-dot every i and cross every t , and still ... the question that keeps coming to me is: what a price to pay. What does it take to get white people to see this? Is that what it took, nine and a half minutes, three minutes beyond no pulse, in order for us to say, \"Well, maybe he didn't do something.\" And that's what we're going to be up against in every case.\n\nHow did you get into this kind of work? How did you get into this formally in talking to white people about white people and about racism?\n\nI fell into it. I was an unqualified white person who, like millions of other unqualified white people, got a job I wasn't qualified for. I sometimes wonder if Black folks aren't amazed at the mediocrity that white people get away with.\n\nWe're no longer amazed by it. We're used to it, but please continue. This is cathartic.\n\nI was your classic white progressive, or \"liberal\" as I called myself at the time. One, I thought, \"Of course, I'm qualified to go into workplaces in cross-racial teams and help primarily white employees grapple with racism. I'm qualified because I'm an open-minded white person.\" And two, \"That's going to be really fun. Who wouldn't like to have those conversations? Aren't they cool, isn't this interesting?\" On both counts, I was in for the most profound learning of my entire life.\n\nSo basically I answered a job announcement for a diversity trainer. I had just graduated with a degree in sociology, had no idea what I could do for a living, saw that ad, and applied for the job and got it. Everything about it was fish out of water. I'm a nontraditional student, so I was in my 30s at this time when I graduated with a bachelor's, and I could be that far in life-college educated, a parent-and never had had my racial worldview challenged, and certainly not in any sustained way by a significant number of people of color, but we were working in cross-racial teams. So that was the first fish out of water.\n\nThe second one was the hostility, the meanness of white people to this conversation. You don't have to scratch very hard on white progressives to get them quite resentful. I was a lot like a deer in headlights in the beginning, but it became so predictable. It really is a lot like a script. I imagine this happens for you. Like, \"OK, here it goes. I know exactly what this person's going to say right now.\" So I actually went on to get my Ph.D., so I'm a little bit different in that I went from practice to theory, rather than theory to practice, but that's how I ended up here.\n\nWhy is it that white people have so much difficulty talking about whiteness even amongst themselves? Because Black people have no problem talking about being Black amongst ourselves.\n\nThere are several threads. The first one that comes to my mind is it serves us not to have these conversations. It serves us to be too uncomfortable, to have such delicate sensibilities that we can't tolerate it. There's a function to that. That's not just a natural response. So, that's one piece. Another piece is the paradigm we're using. I don't think you could have come up with a more effective way to protect racism as a system, and the way that white people benefit from it, than to define it as an individual act of conscious meanness. And as long as you define it that way, you guarantee denial and defensiveness. Often when white people take umbrage to what I'm saying, I say, \"Hey, if that's how I was defining racism, I agree with you that it would be offensive for me to suggest that you're automatically racist, just because you're white when I don't know you.\" But that is not the sociological definition. That is not the understanding of the framework that those of us who really engage in this work are using.\n\nWhen you understand it as a system, things like guilt just become moot. I did not choose to be socialized into a racist ideology, into a white supremacist ideology, internalization of superiority. I would never have chosen that, but I wasn't given a choice. What I do feel now is responsible for the outcome. I was socialized into that and now it's on me to challenge that.\n\nSo when someone comes up to you and says, \"Hey, I don't individually do mean things. I hired a Black intern and my brother's, cousin's, sister's, next-door neighbor's, college roommate actually dated a Black guy once.\" When you hear that from people, what is your counter to get them to realize, \"No, you still actually have individual responsibility, even if you haven't individually been hostile to somebody.\"\n\nWell, first of all, I would question whether they had not individually been hostile to somebody or hurtful, because I would imagine the thousand daily cuts that are so exhausting for Black folks in primarily white environments, as I imagine you are aware, they're not conscious or intentional, but they have an impact, nonetheless. So, that goes back to that question of not if I've been socialized into this, but how . My racism doesn't look like a white nationalist's racism, but it looks like something. If you grant that the society is built on, rooted in, and permeates with a white supremist ideology and racism, that it is a system in all institutions, then you know you're a part of it and you can change your question to, \"OK, how am I a part of it? What does mine look like? How do I know how well I'm doing?\" One, \"Do I even have relationships?\"\n\nIt always surprises me, white people who live pretty much completely segregated lives, as most white people do, and yet are totally confident that they have no racism, no bias, would never do anything. But on the occasion when they got feedback that they have, how have they responded? If they never got feedback again, odds are, that doesn't mean they're doing great. It means they respond in a way that said they can't hear it. So the relationship just isn't as authentic as they think that it is. I can't probably come out and directly say that to somebody who's saying, \"I don't do mean things,\" but that's what I would try to have them understand and I would also use an analogy that they might be able to relate to. This one's easy for anyone who identifies as female: to imagine that any man could be untouched by patriarchy. What little boy doesn't know that it's better to be a boy than a girl, and things are going to go better for you if you don't do anything that's associated with girls or girl-like? It's really similar around race. We know at a very early age that it's better to be white. So how is the internalization of that coming out?\n\nBut what I find interesting is that white fragility can manifest itself differently in men versus women. A white man's fragility comes in terms of really his sense of masculinity. Like, \"Hey, I'm a white man. I've done this, I've earned this, I've earned this, I've earned this, and I think Halle Berry's hot, so I'm not a bigot.\" Then a white woman is like, \"Well, hey, I'm already a woman. How could I be an oppressor because I've already been denied opportunities.\" What's the process internally in breaking down those sort of gender biases that people have to get them to look at their racial biases?\n\nWell, I might say, \"Yes, you've worked really, really hard, but there's a major barrier you didn't face, so that impacted the outcome of your hard work.\" I often use swimming in currents in the water. When you swim with a current, not only does it impact the outcome of your effort, you're moving your arms, you're working, but it's paying off in a way that you don't even see or feel. When you swim against the current, you're acutely aware of it. That's why I would try to go in somewhere where they might relate to being against the current. If the question is ultimately, how do you get white people to engage and see this without defensiveness? That's the million-dollar question. There are strategies, but it's hard.\n\nWhat do you say when you are doing seminars or doing training and you meet white people who say, \"I have a Black spouse. How can I be racist if I love this man, or I love this woman?\" or \"we have adopted Black children.\" How do you get to those white people to get them to understand that diverse Cheerios commercials do not mean racism is over?\n\nI actually have a piece under a chapter called Common Patterns of White Progressives. It's basically making sure everyone knows you're married to a Black man. That pattern. And the point is not that you can't share it. If I was married to a Black man, what an incredibly potential source of deep understanding. But I say \"potential,\" because so many white women married to Black men don't demonstrate that, because if you are using your marriage as proof that you're not racist, you don't understand systemic racism. If anything, what you come away with is, \"This is lifelong and ongoing. It'll never be finished. I have so much more awareness. I have so much more skills, and I still step in it on occasion.\"\n\nHow do people like you, with privilege, make space for people whose knowledge and lived experiences are not as valued because they're people of color? How do you actively center and not erase their perspectives and voices?\n\nYeah. That's a deep tension. I have struggled with that tension my entire career. None of us are outside the system, and there's no clean way to do any of this work, that's for sure. I try to use that. That is the reality, based on all we've been talking about, based on deep implicit bias, white people are a tad more open to being challenged by someone who it's harder to deny. There's a little bit of that, \"Nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Hey, you know and I know\" that gets me in to crack that open. I think about it as tilling the soil. Let me soften this up a little bit so that folks can hear you and can listen to you.So to not use this platform or this position for me is not acceptable. As I use it, yes, I'm also centering whiteness and I'm interrupting whiteness, because it stays centered by being unnamed and unmarked. Here we're back to the tension.\n\nWe will never understand racism as white people who are only listening to each other, but I don't think we'll ever fully understand if we only listen to Black folks and other folks of color, right? And for far too long, we've offloaded all that labor with all the risks and all the costs and all the punishments and all the backlash. What that does is it reinforces this idea that we're innocent of race. We are not racially innocent. We are a part of this puzzle. It's just like, \"I'm so sad that happens to you, but apparently it happens in a vacuum that has nothing to do with me.\" No, it's coming from me, and I have got to be at the table, also engaged in this conversation and this work, and hopefully do it in ways where I use my platform to amplify Black voices.* I hope that I've already demonstrated that just in our conversation.\n\nCorrection, May 17, 2021: Due to a transcription error, this post originally misquoted DiAngelo as saying she uses her platform \"to amplify Black racism.\" She said she uses her platform \"to amplify Black voices.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "White Lies\n\nListen to A Word ... With Jason Johnson:\n\n\"I'm not racist\": Many self-proclaimed white allies say this to shut down conversations about how racism affects our society. Black people have been calling BS forever, but Robin DiAngelo, author of the 2018 bestseller White Fragility , has emerged as the leading white voice on the issue. The book gained a whole new audience during the so-called racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd last year. DiAngelo is now arguably the most prominent white voice calling for white people to be held accountable for racism. She has made it her mission to demand that white people face their role in perpetuating and benefiting from racism.\n\nDiAngelo and I recently spoke as part of the Crosscut Festival, an online conference that took a hard look at the people, policy, and events that shape our lives. On Friday's episode of A Word, we shared a portion of that conversation. I started by asking her whether she was surprised that Derek Chauvin was convicted on all counts in the murder of George Floyd. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nRobin DiAngelo: I was surprised that he was found guilty on all three accounts, just because watching the trial, it seems absolutely undeniable and indisputable that he's guilty on all three accounts, [but] based on the history of our criminal justice system...I didn't expect that to come through on all accounts. Symbolically, it is profound and of profound importance, but as Carol Anderson so powerfully argues using White Rage , every inch of racial progress has been met by a white backlash. We can see at the same time those forces growing really strongly. It is a potential beginning, but if we relax around it, that's all it will be, I think.\n\nJason Johnson: So the day of the ruling, my first reaction is I was not surprised and I wasn't particularly happy. I had long predicted that Derek Chauvin was going to be found guilty and the reason why is because I felt like white supremacy in America occasionally has its sacrificial lambs. How do you respond to that take, that it's like, \"Well, of course, the system will get rid of this one bad guy after a year of protest,\" but does it speak to the fact that we may see changes when it comes to the other officers being held accountable? Or the half a dozen other shootings that we've seen just during the two or three weeks of the trial?\n\nYeah, well, all systems of oppression can accommodate exceptions, but the rule will remain consistent and the exceptions will be used to negate the rule. We saw that during Obama's presidency: ' We're post-racial now .' It was actually harder for me to do my work during Obama's presidency than it is today because I don't think anybody is in denial that we are so not post-racial. Not only could the system accommodate that exception, but it gave it an infusion of racism, an infusion of explicit racism. It got more legitimacy to express than it had before. We're going to have to be really careful as always-dot every i and cross every t , and still ... the question that keeps coming to me is: what a price to pay. What does it take to get white people to see this? Is that what it took, nine and a half minutes, three minutes beyond no pulse, in order for us to say, \"Well, maybe he didn't do something.\" And that's what we're going to be up against in every case.\n\nHow did you get into this kind of work? How did you get into this formally in talking to white people about white people and about racism?\n\nI fell into it. I was an unqualified white person who, like millions of other unqualified white people, got a job I wasn't qualified for. I sometimes wonder if Black folks aren't amazed at the mediocrity that white people get away with.\n\nWe're no longer amazed by it. We're used to it, but please continue. This is cathartic.\n\nI was your classic white progressive, or \"liberal\" as I called myself at the time. One, I thought, \"Of course, I'm qualified to go into workplaces in cross-racial teams and help primarily white employees grapple with racism. I'm qualified because I'm an open-minded white person.\" And two, \"That's going to be really fun. Who wouldn't like to have those conversations? Aren't they cool, isn't this interesting?\" On both counts, I was in for the most profound learning of my entire life.\n\nSo basically I answered a job announcement for a diversity trainer. I had just graduated with a degree in sociology, had no idea what I could do for a living, saw that ad, and applied for the job and got it. Everything about it was fish out of water. I'm a nontraditional student, so I was in my 30s at this time when I graduated with a bachelor's, and I could be that far in life-college educated, a parent-and never had had my racial worldview challenged, and certainly not in any sustained way by a significant number of people of color, but we were working in cross-racial teams. So that was the first fish out of water.\n\nThe second one was the hostility, the meanness of white people to this conversation. You don't have to scratch very hard on white progressives to get them quite resentful. I was a lot like a deer in headlights in the beginning, but it became so predictable. It really is a lot like a script. I imagine this happens for you. Like, \"OK, here it goes. I know exactly what this person's going to say right now.\" So I actually went on to get my Ph.D., so I'm a little bit different in that I went from practice to theory, rather than theory to practice, but that's how I ended up here.\n\nWhy is it that white people have so much difficulty talking about whiteness even amongst themselves? Because Black people have no problem talking about being Black amongst ourselves.\n\nThere are several threads. The first one that comes to my mind is it serves us not to have these conversations. It serves us to be too uncomfortable, to have such delicate sensibilities that we can't tolerate it. There's a function to that. That's not just a natural response. So, that's one piece. Another piece is the paradigm we're using. I don't think you could have come up with a more effective way to protect racism as a system, and the way that white people benefit from it, than to define it as an individual act of conscious meanness. And as long as you define it that way, you guarantee denial and defensiveness. Often when white people take umbrage to what I'm saying, I say, \"Hey, if that's how I was defining racism, I agree with you that it would be offensive for me to suggest that you're automatically racist, just because you're white when I don't know you.\" But that is not the sociological definition. That is not the understanding of the framework that those of us who really engage in this work are using.\n\nWhen you understand it as a system, things like guilt just become moot. I did not choose to be socialized into a racist ideology, into a white supremacist ideology, internalization of superiority. I would never have chosen that, but I wasn't given a choice. What I do feel now is responsible for the outcome. I was socialized into that and now it's on me to challenge that.\n\nSo when someone comes up to you and says, \"Hey, I don't individually do mean things. I hired a Black intern and my brother's, cousin's, sister's, next-door neighbor's, college roommate actually dated a Black guy once.\" When you hear that from people, what is your counter to get them to realize, \"No, you still actually have individual responsibility, even if you haven't individually been hostile to somebody.\"\n\nWell, first of all, I would question whether they had not individually been hostile to somebody or hurtful, because I would imagine the thousand daily cuts that are so exhausting for Black folks in primarily white environments, as I imagine you are aware, they're not conscious or intentional, but they have an impact, nonetheless. So, that goes back to that question of not if I've been socialized into this, but how . My racism doesn't look like a white nationalist's racism, but it looks like something. If you grant that the society is built on, rooted in, and permeates with a white supremist ideology and racism, that it is a system in all institutions, then you know you're a part of it and you can change your question to, \"OK, how am I a part of it? What does mine look like? How do I know how well I'm doing?\" One, \"Do I even have relationships?\"\n\nIt always surprises me, white people who live pretty much completely segregated lives, as most white people do, and yet are totally confident that they have no racism, no bias, would never do anything. But on the occasion when they got feedback that they have, how have they responded? If they never got feedback again, odds are, that doesn't mean they're doing great. It means they respond in a way that said they can't hear it. So the relationship just isn't as authentic as they think that it is. I can't probably come out and directly say that to somebody who's saying, \"I don't do mean things,\" but that's what I would try to have them understand and I would also use an analogy that they might be able to relate to. This one's easy for anyone who identifies as female: to imagine that any man could be untouched by patriarchy. What little boy doesn't know that it's better to be a boy than a girl, and things are going to go better for you if you don't do anything that's associated with girls or girl-like? It's really similar around race. We know at a very early age that it's better to be white. So how is the internalization of that coming out?\n\nBut what I find interesting is that white fragility can manifest itself differently in men versus women. A white man's fragility comes in terms of really his sense of masculinity. Like, \"Hey, I'm a white man. I've done this, I've earned this, I've earned this, I've earned this, and I think Halle Berry's hot, so I'm not a bigot.\" Then a white woman is like, \"Well, hey, I'm already a woman. How could I be an oppressor because I've already been denied opportunities.\" What's the process internally in breaking down those sort of gender biases that people have to get them to look at their racial biases?\n\nWell, I might say, \"Yes, you've worked really, really hard, but there's a major barrier you didn't face, so that impacted the outcome of your hard work.\" I often use swimming in currents in the water. When you swim with a current, not only does it impact the outcome of your effort, you're moving your arms, you're working, but it's paying off in a way that you don't even see or feel. When you swim against the current, you're acutely aware of it. That's why I would try to go in somewhere where they might relate to being against the current. If the question is ultimately, how do you get white people to engage and see this without defensiveness? That's the million-dollar question. There are strategies, but it's hard.\n\nWhat do you say when you are doing seminars or doing training and you meet white people who say, \"I have a Black spouse. How can I be racist if I love this man, or I love this woman?\" or \"we have adopted Black children.\" How do you get to those white people to get them to understand that diverse Cheerios commercials do not mean racism is over?\n\nI actually have a piece under a chapter called Common Patterns of White Progressives.

      "text": "Santa Claus Should Not Be a White Man Anymore\n\nIllustration by Mark Stamaty\n\nW hen I was a kid, I knew two different Santa Clauses. The first had a fat belly, rosy cheeks, a long white beard, and skin as pink as bubble gum. He was omnipresent, visiting my pre-school and the local mall, visible in all of my favorite Christmas specials.\n\nThen there was the Santa in my family's household, in the form of ornaments, cards, and holiday figurines. A near-carbon copy of the first one-big belly, rosy cheeks, long white beard: check, check, check. But his skin was as dark as mine.\n\nSeeing two different Santas was bewildering. Eventually I asked my father what Santa really looked like. Was he brown, like us? Or was he really a white guy?\n\nMy father replied that Santa was every color. Whatever house he visited, jolly old St. Nicholas magically turned into the likeness of the family that lived there.\n\nIn hindsight, I see this explanation as the great Hollywood spec script it really is. (Just picture the past-their-prime actors who could share the role. Robert De Niro! Eddie Murphy! Jackie Chan! I smell a camp classic.) But at the time, I didn't buy it. I remember feeling slightly ashamed that our black Santa wasn't the \"real thing.\" Because when you're a kid and you're inundated with the imagery of a pale seasonal visitor-and you notice that even some black families decorate their houses with white Santas-you're likely to accept the consensus view, despite your parents' noble intentions.\n\nTwo decades later, America is less and less white, but a melanin-deficient Santa remains the default in commercials, mall casting calls, and movies. Isn't it time that our image of Santa better serve all the children he delights each Christmas?\n\nYes, it is. And so I propose that America abandon Santa-as-fat-old-white-man and create a new symbol of Christmas cheer. From here on out, Santa Claus should be a penguin.\n\nThat's right: a penguin.\n\nWhy, you ask? For one thing, making Santa Claus an animal rather than an old white male could spare millions of nonwhite kids the insecurity and shame that I remember from childhood. Whether you celebrate the holiday or not, Santa is one of the first iconic figures foisted upon you: He exists as an incredibly powerful image in the imaginations of children across the country (and beyond, of course). That this genial, jolly man can only be seen as white-and consequently, that a Santa of any other hue is merely a  \" joke \" or a chance to trudge out racist stereotypes -helps perpetuate the whole \" white-as-default \" notion endemic to American culture (and, of course, not just American culture).\n\nPlus, people love penguins. There are blogs dedicated entirely to their cuteness . They're box office gold . Most importantly, they're never scary (in contrast to, say, polar bears and reindeer). Most kids love Santa-because he brings them presents. But human Santa can be terrifying-or at least unsettling .\n\nAnd, with a penguin Santa, much Christmas folklore can remain unchanged. Being a penguin, Santa Claus can still reside in a snowy homeland-though for scientific accuracy we'll need to move him from the North Pole to the South. He can still rock a fake white beard and red suit if he chooses. Since penguins can't fly, Rudolph and his fellow reindeer will remain a crucial element to getting the job done on Christmas Eve. You may have even spotted a penguin here and there already among the holiday books and Christmas kitsch .\n\nWill kids have a harder time believing in Santa the Penguin-aka Penguin Claus-than in the fat white guy he's replacing? I don't think so. Kids are used to walking, talking bears and gigantic friendly bird s. A penguin delivering gifts might even seem more feasible to them, since cartoons have primed them to consider such creatures fairly run of the mill.\n\nOf course, since we created Santa, we can certainly change him however we'd like-and we have, many times over. Like the holiday itself, Santa has long since been extracted from his religious roots, even if the name St. Nicholas still gets thrown around. Our current design takes inspiration from multiple sources, including Washington Irving's 1809 description of St. Nick \" riding jollily among the tree tops , or over the roofs of the houses, now and then drawing forth magnificent presents from his breeches pockets, and dropping them down the chimnies of his favourites.\" When Clement Clarke Moore published \" A Visit from St. Nicholas \" in 1823, the old man was described and illustrated as a \"plump\" but elfin figure. Since then, Santa has been redesigned and re-appropriated to push everything from soda to war .\n\nSo let's ditch Santa the old white man altogether, and embrace Penguin Claus-who will join the Easter Bunny in the pantheon of friendly, secular visitors from the animal kingdom who come to us as the representatives of ostensibly religious holidays. It's time to hand over the reins to those deer and let the universally beloved waddling bird warm the hearts of children everywhere, regardless of the color of their skin.*\n\nCorrection, Dec. 10, 2013: This article originally identified penguins as mammals.

      "text": "America Needs an Education in Whiteness\n\nThese 28 days of Black History Month are dedicated to the sometimes painful and absolutely essential history of Americans of African descent. The month also brings the usual grumblings demanding a white equivalent . And those of us who study culture and history are tasked to explain the many reasons why that is a horrible idea ( again ).\n\nBut maybe we need a different tactic, because as recent events in Virginia politics show, clearly some sort of education on whiteness is in order. Esquire magazine's controversial and poorly timed profile this month headlined \"The Life of an American Boy at 17\" further hints at the entrenched perception that being truly American means being white.\n\nWe don't need to honor a \"white history\" per se-we already emphasize it in our schools and on most national holidays throughout the rest of the year. But educating people about the invention of whiteness is something this country desperately needs. Both the titan of black studies, W.E.B. Du Bois, and the titan of black letters, James Baldwin, seemed to think so.\n\nWhile their writing on the black experience is well known, Du Bois and Baldwin don't get enough credit for their contributions toward our understanding of what it means to be \"white.\" Du Bois is credited as the pioneer of the whiteness studies , through a number of his works, one fittingly titled example being the chapter \"The Souls of White Folk\" from his 1920 book, Darkwater .\n\nHe states that while the exploitation of darker peoples had existed for some time, being \"white\" was a more recent phenomenon. Du Bois was among the first to recognize the origins of the myth of whiteness, noting in the chapter that \"personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing.\" Du Bois noted the strong association with white privilege and ownership, and satirically defined whiteness as \"the ownership of the earth.\"\n\nThis was not a diss against white people themselves but one against the injurious effects of believing in the privilege of whiteness. Whiteness became \"plausible\" by teaching the younger generations through emphasis and omission in textbooks , curriculum , and even patents . That way, any great thought, soul, or action was perceived to be a white person's-or more accurately, a white man's .

      "text": "America Needs an Education in Whiteness\n\nThese 28 days of Black History Month are dedicated to the sometimes painful and absolutely essential history of Americans of African descent. The month also brings the usual grumblings demanding a white equivalent . And those of us who study culture and history are tasked to explain the many reasons why that is a horrible idea ( again ).\n\nBut maybe we need a different tactic, because as recent events in Virginia politics show, clearly some sort of education on whiteness is in order. Esquire magazine's controversial and poorly timed profile this month headlined \"The Life of an American Boy at 17\" further hints at the entrenched perception that being truly American means being white.\n\nWe don't need to honor a \"white history\" per se-we already emphasize it in our schools and on most national holidays throughout the rest of the year. But educating people about the invention of whiteness is something this country desperately needs. Both the titan of black studies, W.E.B. Du Bois, and the titan of black letters, James Baldwin, seemed to think so.\n\nWhile their writing on the black experience is well known, Du Bois and Baldwin don't get enough credit for their contributions toward our understanding of what it means to be \"white.\" Du Bois is credited as the pioneer of the whiteness studies , through a number of his works, one fittingly titled example being the chapter \"The Souls of White Folk\" from his 1920 book, Darkwater .\n\nHe states that while the exploitation of darker peoples had existed for some time, being \"white\" was a more recent phenomenon. Du Bois was among the first to recognize the origins of the myth of whiteness, noting in the chapter that \"personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing.\" Du Bois noted the strong association with white privilege and ownership, and satirically defined whiteness as \"the ownership of the earth.\"\n\nThis was not a diss against white people themselves but one against the injurious effects of believing in the privilege of whiteness. Whiteness became \"plausible\" by teaching the younger generations through emphasis and omission in textbooks , curriculum , and even patents . That way, any great thought, soul, or action was perceived to be a white person's-or more accurately, a white man's . Another, more violent effect in believing in this privilege that Du Bois asserted was whiteness's response to those who were indignant of whiteness: a \"passionate hatred, vast by the very vagueness of its expression,\" meant to impose said privilege- the cruel practice of lynching being an infamous example.\n\nJames Baldwin similarly wrote extensively on whiteness, explaining that it existed on a spectrum.

      "text": "How Much Money Is White Male Privilege Worth?\n\nThinkstock\n\nStatistics on women in business leave little room for interpretation. Even though study upon study prove that companies with women in leadership positions enjoy greater returns on equity, are more profitable, and have greater client satisfaction, at our current rate of progress, it will take another full century for the U.S. to achieve gender parity in the C suite. Programs that encourage gender diversity in hiring and promotions still center their narratives on men . It took the U.S. more than two decades to award just 5 percent of government contracting dollars to female-owned companies.\n\nIn case this stream of numbers and charts fails to leave a memorable mark, economists, artists, and advocates have put systemic workplace discrimination into terms people in power can understand. There's Equal Pay Day , a day about nine months into the year that indicates when women, were they compensated at the same rate as men, would stop getting paid and work for free for the rest of the year. And now, theoretical neuroscientist Vivienne Ming has calculated the average monetary amount- the \"tax,\" she calls it -women, people of color, and queer people must pay for the extra education, training, and experience they need to get the same jobs and promotions as straight white men.\n\nMing, who is transgender, was inspired in part by her observations on how people treated her differently once she transitioned in her 30s. Using data gleaned from websites such as LinkedIn, Bitbucket, and Facebook, Ming and her team analyzed programmers who do good work, and those who excel in their careers, to determine who companies hired and why. The tax, which also takes into account the cost of lost work, comes from Ming's data model that estimates \"how good people were at jobs they never had.\" From Quartz :\n\nIt costs about £38,000 ($54,000) to be a gay man in England; women in the U.S. tech industry pay a tax of between $100,000 and $300,000; and women in tech in Hong Kong or Singapore face an even steeper $800,000 to $1.5 million. ... It's a tax, [Ming] says, that doesn't pay for anything, like roads or schools. In scientific terms, \"it's heat loss in our economy,\" Ming says.\n\nMing's privilege tax might find a practical application in a forthcoming app that divides a restaurant bill among a table of friends, taking into account the race and gender wage gaps. EquiTable began as Equipay , which won the grand prize at Cultivated Wit's Comedy Hack Day in January and is set to launch as an actual app this month. It promises to calculate a fair tab split using wage information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a system it calls \"affirmative fractions\"; the Comedy Hack Day version also let users track whether their friend group is Oscars-level white, college brochure­-level diverse, or somewhere in between. Promising \"reparations, one meal at a time,\" EquiTable will automatically add a surcharge to high-privilege dining groups, which the organization says will subsidize other diners' meals and go toward some kind of charitable endeavor.\n\nEquiTable's wealth redistribution-as­-performance art calls to mind a brilliant GoFundMe project from 2014 entitled \" I need some white privilege! \" Built by a black student named Yaya in response to the white guy who made a Kickstarter to fund a batch of potato salad and netted more than $55,000, the fundraiser asked for the $135,000 Yaya in theoretical lost wages as \"someone who has historically been classified by the United States government as a Black/African American woman\" in the workforce for 15 years. Yaya wrote:\n\nFrom being assumed to have \"cheated\" my way into programs for gifted children AND college (via affirmative action), to having my natural hair viewed as unprofessional amongst professional peers, to having people make negative assumptions about my competency level, interests, and job knowledge, to being viewed as naturally dangerous or threatening, my lack of white privilege has created numerous obstacles as I've struggled to successfully compete in a white dominated workforce. I am hoping that, through this campaign, I will begin to make some headway towards closing the gap that white privilege has created in my life.\n\nIn return for donations, Yaya offered perks that included \"[agreeing] to be the black friend you are referencing when you tell people 'I'm not racist, I have a black friend!\" and following contributors around, dressed like a cop, to harass them and thereby imbue them with some \"street cred.\" Yaya earned just over $1 for every $10 her white potato-salad counterpart made.\n\nOf course, not all privilege can be monetized. Take this recent McSweeney's meditation on the workplace privileges of a white man:\n\nJoining an all-hands staff meeting a half-hour late, I immediately take control of the room through constant interruptions, derisive snorts, and loudly slurping two-dozen chilled oysters. When the meeting breaks, I am taken aside and told I have management potential. The fact that I don't work there is never brought up.\n\nBigger paychecks might make the yacht-club fees go down easier, but the joy of unselfconscious oyster consumption is priceless.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Men Got Exactly What They Wanted\n\nThe 2024 election, perhaps more than any other in history, was an election of identity politics. But unlike what that term usually implies-that we're talking about women and/or racial minorities-this race was about a particular kind of masculine identity that increasingly crosses racial lines, and imperils women and men alike.\n\nDonald Trump's strategy of courting disaffected men was a risky one: After all, men are less likely than women to vote, and the disaffected don't tend to be the most civically engaged citizens. With this election being the first since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision allowed Republican-run states across the nation to criminalize abortion, liberals and feminists understandably believed that it would be a referendum on misogyny. And it was. The problem is that it turns out the United States is pretty damn sexist-and a lot of men wanted this election to be about them. Their votes for Trump weren't about just the economy, or crime, or immigration; their votes were about reasserting their dominance.\n\nSexism, of course, doesn't explain everything about this election. Many voters are genuinely frustrated with the high costs of housing and groceries and remember lower interest rates and cheaper gas under Trump; many genuinely do see undocumented immigration as out of control, overwhelming the fragile support systems in their cities, and contributing to the kind of low-level disorder and dysfunction they find increasingly intolerable. Plenty of women voted for Donald Trump, including, if exit polls are to be believed (and I'm looking at CNN's ), close to half of white women. Compared with 2020 and 2016, it looks as if more Latinas voted for Trump this year too, even as upward of 60 percent cast their ballots for Harris.\n\nBut as in 2016, Trump's 2024 victory was a largely male one and a largely white one. This time, though, he peeled off more men of color. For the first time, a majority of Latino men voted Republican. Trump's support among white men, and his overwhelming support among white men without college degrees, held steady. And as in 2020, roughly 20 percent of Black men voted for him (in 2016, that number was less than 15 percent). The one group that has moved significantly away from Trump is white college-grad women: This demographic never backed Trump en masse, but nearly 60 percent of them voted for Kamala Harris, compared with 51 percent who backed Hillary Clinton.\n\nGender was a major driver of Trump's victory in 2016. Eight years later, pundits and analysts will be hunting for a newer, fresher explanation. But sometimes the truth simply asserts itself on repeat.\n\nIn 2016 Trump pitched himself to the disaffected working-class white man. He ran a campaign of explicit gender and racial grievance. His rallies were characterized by gross and almost cartoonish misogyny. He won, and political science researchers confirmed that although a sense of economic displacement was real, racism and sexism were the fuel that powered the Trump fire. It wasn't just that working-class white men were frustrated by their lots in life; they were frustrated because they were no longer easily ahead of women and racial minorities, and because they no longer lived in a country dominated by people who looked and believed as they did.\n\nIn 2024 the pitch changed a bit. The racial grievances remained-undocumented immigrants were still described as criminals and even people \"poisoning the blood of our country\"; Puerto Rico was described as a floating island of trash-but it was better couched in issue-specific terms. The misogyny remained too, but it also got a glow-up. Instead of leaning into the vulgarity of \"Trump the Bitch\" slogans, Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, promised men an administration that saw them, that worked for them, that sought to restore them to power, and that liked and respected them. And they contrasted it with a Democratic Party that didn't just forget men but was outright hostile to their very nature. (In this telling, when liberals criticize toxic masculinity, they're just talking about men in general.) Yes, Kamala Harris came in for more than her share of Trump-supporter sexism and racism-casting her as a prostitute and as low-IQ were favorite insults-but the ultimate case Trump and Vance made for themselves was less \"Don't elect this bitch\" and more \"Put someone who gets you in the White House.\"\n\nTo this end, Trump surrounded himself with tech bros and podcast bros and fighting bros. The men of the Christian right and the architects of Project 2025 were there too, but they receded a bit as Trump courted the kind of men who may not go to church much anymore but who still want the respect traditionally afforded to men simply by virtue of being men. Vance spoke to this directly in earlier podcast clips and fundraising appeals that may have been damaging to his ticket's female support but might also have piqued the interest of resentful male listeners: He derided single cat ladies and by extension the entire category of women who believe that their lives are just as good (if not better) without men than with them. The men Trump and Vance courted likely don't believe they hate women at all, despite voting against women's most fundamental rights. Many of them seem to desperately want female affection, approval, and, perhaps most of all, respect-but, having not exactly earned it, long for a time when female deference was essentially mandatory.\n\nThat is the America that Trump and Vance promised these men they would bring back. Yes, it's an America where a (white) working-class man could make a living wage-but the fantasy is less about the number on a paycheck and more about the ability to have a financially dependent and adoring wife, or to be able to be as violent, crass, and unrestrained as one wishes without social consequence. As much as pundits and voters may point to the economy or immigration or crime as the reason voters backed Trump, the truth is that Trump offered virtually nothing in the way of actual policy on any of those issues. He offered instead the promise of masculine strength and male dominance, of men returned to their rightful positions of authority in the White House and in houses across America. He talked to men who are frustrated and men who are adrift, many who feel-despite all evidence-mistreated and even discriminated against. And he promised them a return to power.\n\nThis-the special treatment of men, and of white men in particular-is the original American identity politics. And in 2024, it has put another man in the White House, the latest in an unbroken masculine chain more than two centuries long.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

( Sign up here to get Dear Prudence delivered to your inbox each week. Read Prudie's Slate columns here . Send questions to Prudence at prudence@slate.com .)\n\nEmily Yoffe: Good afternoon, everyone. I look forward to your questions and comments.\n\nQ. Mixed-Race Relationship: I am a black woman for whom culture, race, and politics are very important and sometimes painful subjects. I love my partner of two years very much. He is a white man in his late 30s who has very little experience with these matters, and our differing views have caused many arguments. Now we avoid the subject of my culture completely, and it is killing me that he does not understand this important part of who I am. Occasionally he will make generalizations and comments that I find worrying or insulting. He is not a racist, merely ignorant-he thinks we are all one as humans and should not pay attention to differences. If the playing field were equal between all people, I would agree with him, but it is not. Except for this, he is a sweet and gentle man-intelligent, trustworthy, and a blessing in my life. I love him, but I feel I am betraying my politics and community. Mostly, I just want to talk-but I can see why he avoids it, with all the shouting that's happened. Help.\n\nA: When he expresses his sincere and well-intentioned beliefs, you berate him for his naiveté and ignorance. He certainly has to concede your superior knowledge about being a black person in America. But your attitude seems to be that unless he is a backboard for your views, he's infuriating. You two seem to have arrived at a kind of détente in which you don't talk about this. But then you feel that race, and discussions of it, are so central to your experience that you can't stand having this be something you don't chew over with your beloved. You asked for my help, so I have two alternatives for you. Either you decide that this wonderful man fulfills you in so many ways that you can decide to see him as an oasis from the often troubling issues that you spend so much time on in the rest of your life. Or you conclude having a partner who reflects your own views and experience is so central for you that you must let this good man go.\n\nQ. MIL Brings Moldy Food When Visiting: My parents-in-law live 11 hours away and come to visit my husband, myself, and our three young children about six times a year. On each visit they usually stay for three or four days. Every time they come, my MIL packs a cooler with leftovers from her fridge, which we are expected to be thankful for. The problem is that most of the items, such as partially empty jars of salsa, pasta sauce, and cheese, have already gone moldy. My MIL is an \"environmentalist,\" and I suspect she brings the bad food because then she can claim to create almost no waste. She also brings empty shampoo bottles and leaves them here. I am tired of hearing her wax poetic about how great she is and then leave me with her biohazardous food to clean up. How can we get her to stop bringing us moldy food?\n\nA: If your mother-in-law wants to drag her moldy food and empty bottles across state lines to enhance her self-image, indulge her. Let her unpack her gross goods, then explain you've had bad experiences in the past with old, half-eaten jars of food, and toss them in the garbage. If she makes a scene, she can fish them out and dine on her mold solo.\n\nQ. I'm the Catfish (but Not on Purpose): After breaking up with my husband, I went online to kick-start my dating life. I put my real age (49), body type (overweight), and marital status (separated), along with a recent photo. However, I have a very distinctive name and am somewhat well-known online due to my blog, which has attracted misogynist comments. I therefore didn't want to have my name in public on a dating site and used another name and hometown (near my own). On my very first date, I met a nice man with whom I get on really well. We've now been on three dates, and I think he could be a keeper. The problem? He still doesn't know my real name ... and I'm afraid if I tell him I've been lying about something so fundamental, then everything else I've said to him will seem false. But of course, if I don't tell him my name, it's hopeless anyway. How do I handle this? I've considered just losing his phone number and starting over, now that I know there are nice men out there, even for older, fatter women.\n\nA: On your next date, bring along a tablet, or invite him over your place for dinner, and show him your blog. Explain, just as you've done here, why you used a pseudonym for your first experience with online dating. Then come up with some ground rules with him about posting about your (so far) happy foray.\n\nQ. Re: Interracial Relationship: I am a white woman who has been married to a black man for 38 years, and we've been together for 44 years total. We have two daughters. In my experience, the white person in an interracial relationship (I hope I'm OK using this terminology; I am a little uncomfortable with the legacy/history of the term mixed race ) has a responsibility to learn about the history and culture of his or her beloved. Actually, both people in any relationship have this responsibility, but from what I've seen the black person in the relationship usually knows quite a bit about the history and culture of white people. So my question to the original writer is: Is your boyfriend open to understanding your point of view, to learning what needs to be learned, and to revising the way he talks about race-related issues? If not, seek someone who is, regardless of his race/ethnicity/etc. If he is open, then you will both need patience and time and effort to make it work. But, again, that's true with any relationship. Best of luck, whatever happens!\n\nA: Thanks, and I agree about the need to be educated. What's not clear is whether the boyfriend of the original letter writer seeks to \"invalidate\" her experience-as some other commenters are suggesting-or simply expresses a point of view that differs from hers. I don't see how an interracial relationship works if discussing race is a central focus of the relationship but only one person's point of view is considered valid.\n\nQ. My Dog Is Just Fine: My husband, me, and two young kids adopted a puppy from the humane society last spring. We all adore him. He is now a rather large dog (about 60 pounds) and has been taking longer to train than we anticipated. For that reason we have a large kennel in our living room that we keep him in for meals and for short amounts of time (a couple of hours max) for when we have guests over who are fearful of bigger dogs. My sister-in-law is now saying that since we use a kennel we are abusing the dog and need to give it back to the humane society or to her. I really don't want to get in an argument with my in-laws, but she is now threatening to call the police and say we hit our dog unless we let her take him or give him to the humane society. My husband has tried talking to her, but she will not listen to him. What should we do?\n\nA: Too bad you can't put your sister-in-law in a crate. But she is a nut who is threatening to make a false report about you, so she cannot be a guest in your home. Frankly, if you think she's capable of calling the police on you, you should go to a lawyer and have her or him write up an account of your sister-in-law's threat. That way, if she acts, the lawyer can establish your sister-in-law's pre-existing bad faith. Kennels are very important tools for training and safety with puppies and even older dogs. These are the equivalent of dens, and dogs who are raised with crates will seek them out as cozy places to sleep or refuges from household din. There are also times, with not fully trained puppies, that it can be important for their safety, and that of other people and the carpet, that they retire to their crate. This is not abuse, it is good dog ownership. If your sister-in-law were rational, you could have shown her literature about this. But rational family members don't threaten to make false police reports about other family members.\n\nQ. Sexless Partnership: I have been married over 30 years. We are both still healthy, but three years ago my wife stopped having sex with me, with very little the two years before that. This is punishment for economic problems, starting with a job loss. I can't afford to get divorced yet. I am now involved in two business startups, so 2015 should be better. She sometimes comments that things can then go back to normal. I am no longer interested in her. What is fair?\n\nA: What is fair is that if your businesses get off the ground you start squirreling money away for your divorce fund. I don't know the background here. Maybe your job losses weren't because of the economy but because of your own bad behavior. If so, and your wife lost faith and love in you, that means you two need to figure out a way to address this, or to split. Turning your marriage into a punitive deep freeze was not an answer. You don't want to reconcile with your wife. So you need to reconcile yourself to moving forward solo.\n\nQ. Re: Mixed-Race Relationship: When I first started dating my husband, the things he said out of ignorance used to drive me wild, especially because I was a teacher about human difference in a very liberal college. I realized that while I made an effort to be patient and listen to my students, I wasn't making an effort to make my partner feel heard. To work through this, we decided to read and discuss a piece of feminist literature once a month, kind of like a book club, where we would talk with respect like we were in class. All it took was one article and he immediately picked up on the academic language and nuances that are so necessary to me-after all, he is an exceptionally smart man (and I'm sure your husband is, too).\n\nA: And is he allowed to express any dissention in regard to the literature or your views? After all, he's male, so you could say he has no standing to have an alternate reaction to the assigned reading or to your superior knowledge. If a given subject is central to one party in a relationship, and if any questioning or disagreement about the views that person expresses is seen as invalidating, undermining, or ignorant, then it seems as if the best solution is to find other partners.\n\nQ. My Fiancée Always Takes Her Ring Off: I asked my girlfriend to marry me about three weeks ago. We have been living together for about six months and we are both very happy to be taking a new step forward. There's just a small problem that has been bothering me since we got engaged: My new fiancée regularly removes her ring, and it makes me insanely nervous. She takes off her ring pretty often-to take a shower, wash dishes, cook, clean, go to the gym, etc. I'm so nervous that one of these times, she'll forget where she put the ring and misplace it. I've expressed this concern to her, and she says she just wants to keep the ring looking nice without any scratches or dings. But I think the ring is safer on her finger than in the glove compartment of her car while she's working out, even if she accidentally bangs it against the treadmill once or twice. Can I broach this topic with her again and if so, how?\n\nA: I know the ring represents your betrothal, but it's hers. So you must stop micromanaging her wearing of it. I agree that in the long run it's more likely she misplaces it by taking it off all the time than she damages it by wearing it constantly, but you've discussed it and that's her choice. So make sure your (or her) insurance is up to date so it could cover such a loss, and let this go.\n\nDiscuss this column with Emily Yoffe on her Facebook page.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Specifically, the show examined medical bias on the basis of sex and race, carefully unpacking how everything from outdated textbooks to doctors' unconscious beliefs about women and black patients can lead them to receive substandard care.\n\nFor assistance, Oliver brought in comedian Wanda Sykes, who has joked about those double standards in her stand-up. \"Black people, we don't even get our hands on opioids,\" she said on her Netflix special, Wanda Sykes: Not Normal . \"They don't even give them to us. I had a double mastectomy, you know what they sent my black ass home with? Ibu-fucking-profen.\" On Last Week Tonight , she offered some solutions, including bias training for med students , so they don't believe black people literally have thicker skin than white people. Or you could just bring a white man with you to the hospital.

      "text": "My Megyn Kelly Week\n\nAdapted from the book Wannabe by Aisha Harris. Copyright © 2023 by Aisha Harris. Reprinted by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nSo it's 2013, I'm 25 years old, and I've been at Slate for a little under two years. It's around the holidays, and I'd been thinking about how Santa Claus' race had been a sticking point for me as a kid. The reasons my dad gave me why Santa was Black at home but white pretty much everywhere else I looked seemed like bunk. (He was a shape-shifter, my dad said, who took on the race of whatever household he was visiting. Clever, but I wasn't buying it.) It seemed outdated for Santa to still be depicted in most places as a fat old white dude. So I wondered, what if instead of representing him as a human, we just avoided race and made him some other kind of creature? And what other creature would be more perfect, more beloved-the kind of creature everyone, everywhere could get behind, no problem-than a penguin?\n\nIt was an instant hit in the room. I wrote the piece, making my case lightheartedly while noting the real bias embedded in our culture's white-as-default approach to everything, but especially fictional characters. Someone on the art team created a fun cartoon image of a fat penguin dressed up in a Santa outfit bearing gifts.\n\nThe piece went out into the world in December, and while I expected some pushback-because when you work at Slate, you're basically inviting pushback anytime you publish anything-I thought it'd come and go after a day or two like most stories do.\n\nAnd then Megyn Kelly got involved:\n\nYet another person claiming it's racist to have a white Santa, and-by the way for all you kids watching at home: Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a Black Santa. But you know, Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this 'cause someone wrote about it, kids.\n\nOn her Fox News show The Kelly File , Megyn Kelly's producers corralled a panel of Fox contributors and commentators to bring my piece \"Santa Claus Should Not Be a White Man Anymore\" to the attention of the world. To be fair to the spirit of the mostly ridiculous discussion that took place, two of the panelists, Jedediah Bila and Bernard Whitman, defended my perspective (\"our social fabric can take the elasticity of Kris Kringle,\" the latter said) and seemed to take it all as lightheartedly as I had in my article.\n\nBut no one remembers that part, and for good reason. Kelly (and less famously, the other panelist among them, Monica Crowley) was palpably incensed by what I'd written, as if she were a small child who'd just been told that not only was Santa not real, but the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny were also fakes. She said I'd gone \"off the rails\" in suggesting Santa Penguin, and insisted, with not even a modicum of irony, that \"just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change.\"\n\nOh yeah, and then she added: \"Jesus was a white man, too.\"\n\nI was not watching live when that three-minute segment aired, because I like myself too much and that's not something I do except for the rare occasion when my work requires me to do so. But it didn't take long to feel the debris falling my way as the thing detonated all over the internet that night. What follows next is my particular experience alone, but the gist of this sequence is probably fairly typical of what goes down for any journalist who suddenly goes viral:\n\n1.  First, the general public reacts. I was at a Brooklyn Nets game at the time, and suddenly I was getting messages from friends and colleagues excitedly sharing the news of what had transpired. I wasn't much of a Twitter person at that point yet (God, what a time), but when I went to check my page, I saw that the praise and, more acutely, the vitriol were gushing forth. Pretty standard stuff when you're a Black woman-name-calling, racist and misogynistic slurs (\"n--,\" \"bitch,\" and the twofer, \"n--bitch\").\n\n2.  Almost simultaneously, the outlets and online commentators react. In my case, Kelly's rant was blogged about by seemingly every major news outlet and then some, the greatest hits from the segment being the factory-made quotes \"Santa just is white\" and \"Jesus was a white man, too.\" The Daily Show With Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report each did a segment on it, as did The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\n3.  At this point, the story has grown beyond your wildest dreams (nightmares?) and you feel as though you have to respond to the hubbub in some way. The day after The Kelly File segment aired, I wrote another piece, this one headlined \" What Fox News Doesn't Understand About Santa .\"\n\n4.  While that's happening, you're probably fielding interview requests from some of those same outlets. In just a matter of days, I did the biggest number of public appearances I've ever done for a single piece I've written, including All In with Chris Hayes , The Today Show , Reliable Sources , and NPR's Tell Me More .\n\n5.  Occasionally in these instances, the furor gets so heated (or the news cycle is so slow, as it usually is as Christmas approaches) that you transcend the industry news cycle and bleed into mainstream culture, too. In my case, Kelly's rant made it as far as Saturday Night Live 's \"Weekend Update\" segment, where Kenan Thompson, dressed as Santa, revealed: \"You heard of Secret Santa? Well, here's a secret for you: I'm Black as hell.\"\n\nWhat would normally be a one-, maybe two-day news story stretched out over the course of about a week-a week of nonstop interview requests and emails from people I hadn't spoken to in years reaching out to say they'd been following the controversy. My colleagues and bosses were thrilled; my family and friends were ecstatic and proud. And why wouldn't they be? This moment gave me the kind of publicity many people dream of and spend an inordinate amount of time and effort attempting to manufacture-all because I said I wanted Santa Claus to be a penguin. This was an unqualified win.\n\nI hated nearly every moment of it.\n\nAfter I politely turned down a request from Don Lemon's show a few days into the cycle, the producer replied: \"Thanks for reaching back, Aisha. Are you just a little 'over' the story?\"\n\nMy canned response: \"I'm genuinely surprised at how much attention this continues to get but definitely glad that it sparked a discussion about how our culture is represented.\" I left it at that.\n\nA decade later, I'm more than exhausted by the ongoing discussion about cultural representation. Because frankly, it feels like déjà vu. An ongoing and particularly ridiculous example: Disney's remake of The Little Mermaid , which has the young Black singer Halle Bailey stepping into the fins of Ariel.\n\nAs it happens, my first pop-culture obsession was The Little Mermaid . I was drawn to everything about it: Sebastian's literal and figurative crabbiness, Flounder's flightiness, Ursula's seduction. But more than anything, I wanted to be Ariel, with or without the fins. The bright red hair, the clamshell bra, the handsome prince: By the time I was 3 or 4, I was already fully locked in, longing to be a Disney princess.\n\nMore to the point, I desperately wanted an Ariel doll. But there were no white dolls in our house, and that was deliberate-my dad, as the Santa article mentioned, was very aware of the infamous doll tests that had been conducted by psychologists Mamie and Kenneth Clark in the 1940s, which found that in a study of more than 200 Black kids between the ages of 3 and 7 years old, the majority assigned positive traits to white dolls and negative traits to Black ones. That study became a crucial component in the Brown v. Board of Education case on school desegregation. I was never going to own an Ariel doll.\n\nNow, Black Ariel dolls are available wherever toys are sold for $26.99. And that makes some people very, very angry.\n\nIn fact, the new Little Mermaid 's detractors just might take the cake for having the most absurdist takes this discourse has ever seen. \"From a scientific perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean,\" political commentator Matt Walsh opined on \"science\" of the mythical mermaid creatures. \"I mean, if anything, not only should the Little Mermaid be pale, she should actually be translucent. If you look at deep sea creatures, they're, like, translucent. They have no kind of pigmentation whatsoever.\"\n\nNot as pithy as \"Santa just is white,\" but you've got to hand it to him for that Olympian-grade execution of mental gymnastics. That man's mind is so twisted as to have him convinced he'd rather watch a jellyfish-colored half-human than a Black half-human fall in love with a prince for two hours.\n\nIt's all gotten so predictable some studios are now warning their minority stars to be prepared for the worst, as if any performer of color could be surprised to receive racial harassment. \"It was something that Lucasfilm actually got in front of,\" said Moses Ingram, star of Obi-Wan Kenobi , who faced her own bizarre backlash for appearing on the show . \"[They said to us], 'This is a thing that, unfortunately, likely will happen. But we are here to help you; you can let us know when it happens.' \"\n\nI can empathize. Never in my life had I been called a n-- more times than in the aftermath of Santa Penguin. I stayed off Twitter for a while and vowed never to read the comments under my own articles ever again. (I've mostly kept that promise to myself, and my mind is better for it.) But my inbox was harder to avoid. For every encouraging, friendly, and sweet email I received from people far and wide (Brazil, Nigeria, Belgium, etc.), there was a soul-sucking message from a willfully ignorant racist to counter it and try to knock me down a peg. I deleted most of them, including the handful of death threats, because I don't really need that kind of energy clogging up my inbox.\n\nBy Aisha Harris\n\nSlate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page.\n    Thank you for your support.\n\nBut while I can brush these people off as miserable and pathetic, I can't help but be filled with dread over the fact that such people aren't really outliers, or at the very least, they don't seem like outliers. They are loud and wrong and proud, and their collective voice can't just be tuned out easily.\n\nThese people cling to the purity of myths and legends, which are inherently meant to be fluid, malleable, revised, bent, and subverted through subsequent interpretations. Part of the issue stems from the fact that, no matter how many times or ways a piece of art is appropriated, there will always emerge a dominant version (or versions) of that art. When it comes to narrative storytelling, the versions that tend to prevail are white.\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to anything Disney-related. By nature of its near-monopoly on children's entertainment-and now all-ages entertainment, thanks to owning Marvel, Fox, and so much in between-the images the company has created loom large. \"The Disney version becomes the definitive version,\" animator Glen Keane once said. Which partially explains why Disney keeps creating so-called \"live action\" (CGI) remakes of its previous animated successes. Audiences like what is familiar, and that includes the physical appearances of their favorite heroes and villains. It makes me wonder: Disney may have reimagined Ariel as a Black girl with red locks for its blatant cash grab of a remake, but if a little kid visits one of the conglomerate's theme parks, will they greet an Ariel who looks like the blue-eyed 1989 version-or the 2023 version?\n\nToday, Black kids have more characters to choose from than ever before, so it's moving (and heartbreaking) to watch viral videos of parents recording their Black children as they laid eyes upon Halle Bailey as Ariel in The Little Mermaid.\n\n\"She's Black?\" says one girl. \"Yay!\"\n\n\"She's brown like me!\" exclaims another.\n\nThe joy, the recognition, the kinship these kids are finding in this new version of the character makes me so happy for them, but also a little bit sad for my younger self, who didn't get to have this experience.\n\nWhile writing the Santa piece, I'd emailed my dad asking him to send me a column he'd written for our local paper, the New Haven Register, when I was just shy of 3 years old, titled \"Black Kids Need a Black Santa.\" In some ways, my article echoed his own, though his was from the perspective of a father imagining a more inclusive world for his daughter. He wrote about wanting to make sure I grew up with a \"healthy image\" of myself: \"I do not want her to become one of those statistics that show Black children preferring white dolls to the dolls that look like them.\"\n\nYet I still wound up wishing I had Ariel's red hair and clamshell bra and longing for an Ariel doll I could call my own. If only that little girl knew what awaited her 30 years later .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Booker, 36, said a group of white men confronted him while he was walking to an event at the lake with a friend and later blocked the path to the beach.\n\nBooker said in a Facebook post that he and a friend \"decided to just walk back and attempt to simply have a conversation\" with the group, but that group members \"quickly became aggressive,\" and when Booker and his friend walked away, \"two of them jumped me from behind.\" Booker, who called the assault an attempted lynching, said some of his hair was pulled out and that he heard one of the attackers yell for someone to get a noose.\n\nA group of bystanders came to Booker's aid and some of them filmed the confrontation that showed people screaming at the white men, who are seen pushing Booker's face into a tree.\n\nBooker posted a video on his Facebook page showing footage taken after the initial confrontation ended, in which the white men are seen cursing at him and the bystanders, with at least one yelling racial epithets. Booker said he called 911 and the police saw the videos that were taken of the incident, but as of Tuesday, there were no arrests.\n\nDavid Hennessy, one of Purdy's attorneys, contends that Booker instigated the encounter, threw the first punches, and \"started race-baiting.\" The attorneys said that their client was only restraining Booker.\n\nHennessy also said that Purdy \"passed\" a polygraph test about the incident, specifically regarding questions about Booker's claims that Purdy used racial epithets and threatened to get a noose.\n\n\"Mr. Booker says he survived this near-lynching, yet he stays to videotape people as he race baits them ... and he gets one of them to say some racially insensitive stuff,\" Hennessy said during the news conference.\n\nThe attorney called on Booker to take a polygraph test and offered to pay for it.\n\n\"You can't much prove things with the polygraph, but you can rule things out,\" Hennessey said.\n\nKatherine Leill, Booker's attorney, said in a statement that her client won't be taking a test and that he stands by his account of the incident.\n\n\"This is what repeatedly happens,\" Leill said in a statement. \"The victim gets blamed and shamed. He gets re-victimized.\"\n\nShe said that other witnesses filmed the incident and have corroborated Booker's account. Leill urged authorities to charge the alleged attackers.\n\n\"Look at the video. There are witnesses who saw Sean Purdy's aggression and who heard the racist slurs of his friends. You cannot provoke racism,\" Leill said.\n\nThe Indiana Department of Natural Resources' Law Enforcement Division and the Monroe County Prosecutor's Office have said they are investigating the incident. Leill said Booker spoke with the FBI Monday and that they have opened a hate crime investigation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the FBI told ABC News the agency couldn't comment on ongoing investigations.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

It was a bad video -- young man was the victim, the individual that was arrested was the aggressor, and he's been dealt with accordingly.\"\n\nJonathan Pentland, who is a U.S. Army soldier assigned to Fort Jackson, was arrested at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday and was booked at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center. If found guilty, Pentland faces a $500 fine and 30 days in jail.\n\nThe incident took place on Monday, officials said. Police were called and responded to the neighborhood at the time.\n\nIn the video, posted to Twitter, the man, identified as Pentland, is seen confronting a Black man walking down the sidewalk and yelling at him to leave the neighborhood, known as The Summit, in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nPentland, 42, shoves the victim and yells and curses at him: \"You better start walking right now. You're in the wrong neighborhood, m-----f-----. Get out!\"\n\nThe victim protests, saying he did nothing wrong, and is followed by the suspect who continues berating him.\n\n\"The leaders at Fort Jackson in no way condone the behavior depicted in the video posted recently,\" Brig. Gen. Milford Beagle Jr., Fort Jackson's commander, said in a statement. \"This action deeply impacts our community -- the neighbors in the Summit, the city of Columbia, Richland & Lexington counties, and our Army family.\"\n\n\"I ask that our communities and leaders exercise a degree of patience, affording Sherriff Lott and law enforcement investigators to account for the full measure of events before, during, and after the incident that was recorded,\" the statement added.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's department, the victim \"approached several neighbors in a threatening manner and the confrontation escalated after a neighbor asked Pentland to intervene.\"\n\nThe sheriff said an unspecified underlying medical condition might have led to the victim approaching the neighbors.\n\nLott and Beagle said the Department of Justice is also looking into the incident.\n\nThe sheriff did not confirm the identity of the victim, but confirmed the Black man who was accosted is not a juvenile.\n\nLott said once the video ended, Pentland also shoved the victim again and knocked his phone out of his hand when he tried to take a picture.\n\n\"The message I want to give is that when something like that happens, the sheriff's department is going to act very swiftly and we're going to hold those responsible for those [incidents] accountable,\" Lott said. \"We're not going to let people be bullies in our community. And if you are, you're going to answer for it. And that's what we've done in this case.\"\n\nCommunity leaders, activists, witnesses and the victim's father were interviewed by the sheriff's department during the investigation.\n\nLate Wednesday, the Richmond County Sheriff's Department said Pentland and his family were moved from their home after protests outside became violent and the home was vandalized. The street was shut down to nonresidents, as well.\n\nOfficials said they were called to the Pentland home around 8:20 p.m. Wednesday due to an unknown number of protesters vandalizing the home. One object thrown at the home went through an upstairs window and another broke a light fixture, authorities said.\n\n\"While RCSD has always supported peaceful protests, criminal acts will not be tolerated and those who committed this vandalism will face consequences,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement, according to ABC News South Carolina affiliate WOLO .\n\nIn a passionate speech from the South Carolina State House, state Sen. Mia McLeod referenced the video and spoke of the concern for her own children after the shooting death of Daunte Wright .\n\n\"An African American man was standing on the sidewalk, walking down the street, and was accosted by an angry white man and pushed and demeaned and publicly humiliated,\" said McLeod, who represents the Columbia area. \"He could've have been killed. For what? For walking down the street while Black. If you don't believe that race-based hate is real, you don't have to come to my district to see it. All you have to do is turn on the news every single day.\"\n\nABC News' Mark Osborne contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The video has been viewed more than 470,000 times on Twitter.\n\n\"...We are sick of the discrimination,\" said Butterfield in the tweet. \"Never thought I'd have a personal experience with racism like this...\"\n\nABC News reached out to the man for comment but he did not respond.\n\nThe man, Don Crandall, was fired when the incident came to light, Pax Hotel Group, parent company of Baymont by Wyndham, the hotel he worked at, confirmed on Wednesday in an Instagram post .\n\n\"He has not been transferred or rehired at any of Pax Hotel Group's properties,\" it assured its followers. \"His employment with Pax Hotel Group has been terminated.\"\n\nStadium Centre, the apartment complex he refused to let the four students into because they \"don't belong\", said Crandall, who appeared in the video to be considerably older than the young students, was not a resident and that it had no affiliation or association with the hotel he worked at.\n\nButterfield told ABC News on Tuesday he felt the man's decision to hold the gun was strategic.\n\n\"Once we found out he had the gun, it turned into a whole different situation,\" he said. \"We really think he was trying to provoke us to the point where it got violent so he could retaliate with the gun. I knew that if this dude even feels threatened, he's going to find any excuse to pull the trigger.\"\n\nButterfield said the encounter with Crandall started when the four students were waiting outside the apartment complex for their friend to let them in to join a party. He came out, again, to reiterate the point and that's when Butterfield started recording the events on his phone. That was also when another white student, a resident of the building, tried to intervene on their behalf and let them in.\n\nInside, Crandall refused to let them enter the elevator with him.\n\n\"Find another elevator, you can't get in this one,\" he said, blocking their way as the four students tried to enter it.\n\n\"Why not? Do you own the building?\" the students asked.\n\n\"Because you don't belong in this building,\" he replied, before adding, \"You ain't got a key for the building, you don't belong in the elevator.\"\n\nThe man took out a key to show them, which was when the students noticed he had a gun in his hand.\n\n\"Sir, you bring out your gun. What's your purpose for that?\" one of the students asked.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Forgive me,\" he said, trying to hide it behind him.\n\nFlorida A &M University said in a statement it was cooperating with police.\n\n\"Florida A &M University (FAMU) learned that on Saturday, Sept. 8, at least one FAMU student was the alleged victim of an off-campus incident, which was captured on camera,\" the school told ABC News. \"Our students' safety is our first priority. The Tallahassee Police Department (TPD) is investigating the matter; therefore, FAMU cannot disclose additional details. The University will provide assistance as it is requested by TPD.

He was arrested during a July 8 traffic stop in Redondo Beach where he lives and was charged on Monday with multiple felony counts, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.\n\nThe charges against Wyman were filed following a string of recent incidents across the country in which people have driven into crowds, mostly at protests, injuring multiple people and killing one Black Lives Matter protester during a freeway demonstration.\n\nWyman was charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of hit-and-run driving resulting in serious injury. He was being held at the Los Angeles County Jail, according to online records, and is scheduled to appear in Torrance Municipal Court on Tuesday.\n\nIt was unclear if Wyman has an attorney.\n\nPolice said Wyman was involved in an incident on June 29 at the Staybridge Suites in Torrance.\n\nWyman allegedly approached a small group of African Americans in the hotel's parking lot about 11:30 p.m. and allegedly began yelling racial slurs at them, according to a statement from the Torrance Police Department. The disturbance prompted a member of the group, a 23-year-old man, to call his father, who was working nearby as a security guard, police said.\n\nThe 50-year-old security guard arrived just as Wyman allegedly got into his Chevrolet El Camino and began to drive toward the crowd, police said.\n\nThe security guard, who was armed, drew his gun and fired several shots as the charging car struck him and injured another person in the group, according to police.\n\nThe driver of the El Camino then drove away from the scene.\n\nThe security guard who was struck by the car was taken to a hospital with injuries to his lower extremities, police said. Details on the injuries to the second victims were not immediately available.\n\nThe episode came amidst a series of incidents in which people have used cars to attack groups of protesters across the country.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protester was killed and another was seriously injured on July 4 when a 27-year-old man allegedly drove onto a freeway in Seattle that had been closed due to a protest and barreled into the demonstrators at high speed, police said. The suspect, Dawit Kelete, who is Black, was charged with vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and reckless driving in the incident that left Summer Taylor, 24, dead and Diaz Love, 32, seriously injured.\n\nOn July 6, a 66-year-old white woman allegedly injured two protesters when she drove into a crowd of demonstrators in Bloomington, Indiana, and drove off. Christi Bennett was arrested on Wednesday and charged with two counts of criminal recklessness, a felony. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in serious bodily injury -- a felony -- and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in bodily injury, a misdemeanor.\n\nOn that same day, a 36-year-old white man was arrested after he allegedly drove into a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters in Huntington Station, on New York's Long Island, injuring two demonstrators. The suspect, Anthony Cambareri, of Coram, New York, sped away but was caught a short time later, according to Suffolk County Police.\n\nCambareri was charged with third-degree assault and was issued a desk appearance ticket. He will be arraigned at First District Court in Central Islip at a date yet to be determined.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Women of color are having a worse experience than white women,\" the report said. \"And Black women in particular are having the worst experience of all.\"\n\nThere were 10.7 million Black women in the labor force in 2018, or 53% of the Black labor force, according to the Department of Labor .\n\nWhen it comes to solutions for closing the pay gap for Black women, Mason points to both employers and the federal government.\n\n\"At the federal level, we can pass legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act, which promotes pay equity and pay transparency and prevents employers from asking about salary history, which goes a long way in terms of helping to close the gap,\" she said. \"And enforcement of the Civil Rights Act and Equal Employment Opportunity legislation to mitigate issues related to workforce and workplace discrimination.\"\n\n\"Employers have a role to play in terms of making sure there is pay equity and making sure that women across the board earn what they're worth and the skills and talents they bring to the table,\" Mason added. \"And as a culture and a society, we have a lot of work to do in terms of breaking gender stereotypes around women in the workplace, their value and how much women should be paid for their work.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man\n\nThe Brute. The Buck . And, of course, the Thug .\n\nThose are just some of the names for a racial stereotype that has haunted the collective imagination of White America since the nation's inception.\n\nThe specter of the angry Black man has been evoked in politics and popular culture to convince White folks that a big, bad Black man is coming to get them and their daughters.\n\nI've seen viral videos of innocent Black men losing their lives because of this stereotype. I've watched White people lock their car doors or clutch their purses when men who look like me approach. I've been racially profiled.\n\nIt's part of the psychological tax you pay for being a Black man in America - learning to accept that you are seen by many as Public Enemy No. 1.\n\nBut as I've watched three separate trials about White male violence unfold across the US these past few weeks - the Kyle Rittenhouse trial , the Ahmaud Arbery death trial and the civil case against organizers of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville - I've come to a sobering conclusion:\n\nThere is nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man.\n\nIt's not the \"radical Islamic terrorist\" that I fear the most. Nor is it the brown immigrant or the fiery Black Lives Matter protester, or whatever the latest bogeyman is that some politician tells me I should dread.\n\nIt's encountering an armed White man in public who has been inspired by the White men on trial in these three cases.\n\nHere's what legal experts say helped acquit Kyle Rittenhouse\n\nI'm not suggesting we start racially profiling White men. The vast majority of White men are no menace to society.\n\nCountless White men swallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year's protests over the murder of George Floyd. Plenty of White men - like the Rev. James Reeb, a White Unitarian minister - died for Black people during the civil rights movement.\n\nThere is nothing inherently violent about White men, or any human being.\n\nBut recent events have convinced me it's time to put another character on trial: A vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they \"can rule and brutalize without consequence.\"\n\nThis angry White man has been a major character throughout US history. He gave the country slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nIt's this angry White man - not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night - who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America.\n\nThat's a sweeping claim. But these trials represent something bigger than questions of individual guilt or innocence. They offer a disturbing vision of the future, and a choice about what kind of country we want to live in.\n\nThe facts of the trials are well known to many Americans.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty of all charges in the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during a racial protest last year. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, said he was in Kenosha during the protests after the police shooting of Jacob Blake to help protect property. He said he shot the men in self-defense.\n\nIn Georgia, three White men are accused of chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, last year while he was jogging. The men say they were trying to conduct a lawful citizen's arrest, and the man who shot Arbery says he acted in self-defense.\n\nAnd in Virginia, a civil trial is underway to determine if organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally intended to incite racial violence. One person was killed and dozens injured there after White supremacists clashed with counter-demonstrators.\n\nRace is an inescapable theme that runs through all the trials. At the center of each are White men who are accused of using unjustified violence, either against an unarmed Black man or during racial protests. In Rittenhouse's case, a jury cleared him of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nIt's what's happening outside these courtrooms, though, that is most frightening. It suggests these trials are a symptom of a dangerous shift.\n\nIf there was an Exhibit A to describe this shift, it might be an animé video. Earlier this month, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar posted a photoshopped animé video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him attacking President Joe Biden and appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword.\n\nThe House voted this week to censure Gosar, with virtually no Republicans backing the resolution. Gosar took down the video after facing criticism but did not apologize, and later retweeted a post that contained the video.\n\nGosar's video wasn't an isolated incident. Violent political rhetoric has been escalating among some members of the Republican Party. And while not all of it is fueled by White men, much of it starts at the top - with former President Donald Trump .\n\nTrump's violent and sexist rhetoric has been well-documented. More White men now identify as Republican, and the gender gap between both major parties is as large as it's ever been in the last two decades.\n\nOne New York Times columnist, under the headline \" The Angry White Male Caucus,\" said this anger is driven by White men who fear a changing America \"in which the privilege of being a white man isn't what it used to be.\"\n\nThe anger also seems to be getting worse. After President Joe Biden signed an infrastructure bill into law this month, some House Republicans who voted for it reported receiving death threats. Election officials and school board members across the country are also reporting escalating threats.  A recent poll revealed that 30% of Republicans believe that violence is justified to save the country.\n\nPolitical violence is not limited to the GOP. A Bernie Sanders supporter who publicly declared his hatred of conservatives shot five people at a Republican baseball practice in 2017.\n\nBut talking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal - and seemingly acceptable - in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month:\n\n\"When do we get to use the guns? ... How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?\"\n\nAdd to this toxic political atmosphere another element: Laws that not only protect White vigilante violence but, in some cases, seem to embolden vigilantes.\n\nActivists hoped that widely seen videos showing White police officers and White men shooting Black men like Arbery would inspire the courts and state legislatures to revisit laws that made such actions possible.\n\nBut even after nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, little has changed . A growing number of Americans now want police funding increased. And though Georgia overhauled its citizen's arrest law, a reform bill called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act died in Congress two months ago.\n\nThe conservative-leaning US Supreme Court now seems poised to make it easier for people to carry guns in public, based on recent oral arguments over a New York gun control law.\n\nThe US' civilian population is already the most heavily armed in the world. And our streets could soon become even more violent.\n\n\"A significant portion of the gun safety movement's current agenda is likely to come under attack in the coming years,\" Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of \"Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,\" recently told Newsweek . \"I think bans on assault weapons and bans on high-capacity magazines are ripe for the new Supreme Court, with its newly invigorated Second Amendment, to strike down.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has also recently ruled once again in favor of \"qualified immunity,\" the legal doctrine that shields police officers accused of misconduct. There's been little national movement on reforming \"stand your ground laws,\" some of which allow people who believe they're facing an imminent threat to use lethal force without first trying to escape. At least 25 states have such laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.\n\nAnd despite the shocking nature of the Arbery video, there's been little progress on reforming citizen's arrest laws, which allow private citizens to detain or arrest someone they suspect in a crime.\n\nThe White men on trial in the Rittenhouse and Arbery cases both said they acted in self-defense. One of the men in the Arbery case testified that the unarmed Black jogger tried to take his gun, and his life was at risk.\n\nBut consider the potential danger of other White men - or any person wielding a gun in public - feeling emboldened to use deadly force against even an unarmed person by evoking the logic in those defenses, said Eric Ruben, a Second Amendment expert.\n\n\"In other words, their own decision to carry a gun became a justification to use it, lest it be wrested away from them,\" Ruben recently told th e New York Times.\n\nWhile prosecutors didn't show that Rittenhouse was angry that night, there is a perception - fair or not - that he went to Kenosha for reasons more than simply maintaining public safety.\n\nThe comedian Trevor Noah reflected this sentiment in a comment that became a meme: \"No one has ever thought, 'Oh, it's my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.\"\n\nAnd finally, there's a growing fear that no one will be severely punished for the January 6 insurrection because most of the rioters were White. The trials of various defendants are winding their way through the courts now. Jacob Chansley, the so-called \"QAnon Shaman,\" was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the US Capitol riot.\n\nBut many believe the punishment will never match the severity of the crime. What if, say, a mob of Black Lives Matter protesters attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election of a Republican president? How do you think conservative lawmakers would react?\n\nWe are seeing more threats, more guns and more suspicion that the courts will go easy on White people who employ violence. This is the combustible mix that makes more violence almost inevitable.\n\nWe have enough problems with White male violence as it is. Mass shootings in the US are committed more often by White men than by any other group. Top law enforcement officials now say the nation's biggest domestic terror threat comes from White supremacists. And many of the most indelible news images of recent years include angry, red-faced White men, often armed with guns.\n\nConsider scenes from the US Capitol riot, which were filled with angry White men wielding crude weapons and pummeling police. Or the snarling faces of young White men holding tiki torches during the 2017 rally in Charlottesville. Or the angry White men who clashed with anti-racist protesters across the US last year.\n\nWhite male anger has become one of the most potent political forces in contemporary America. That anger helped a White man win the White House. Trump's rise to power is inconceivable without his ability to tap into White male anger and embody it.\n\nHas there ever been an angrier modern president? He is the White male id unleashed.\n\nThis White male anger is causing many people - including other White men - to look over their shoulder when they go out in public. The two men who were shot and killed by Rittenhouse in Wisconsin were White, as was the man he wounded.\n\nIjeoma Oluo , author of \" Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America,\" wrote that she lives with the constant fear that angry White men will turn violent toward her and \"countless other black people, brown people, disabled people, queer people, trans people, and women of every demographic.\"\n\nWhite male anger could prove to be one of the biggest roadblocks we face in building a successful multiracial democracy.\n\nLee Drutman, a scholar who has studied political violence, recently told the New York Times: \"I have a hard time seeing how we have a peaceful 2024 election after everything that's happened now. I don't see the rhetoric turning down, I don't see the conflicts going away. I really do think it's hard to see how it gets better before it gets worse.\"\n\nThis isn't hyperbole. It's history. It happened before.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the US attempted to build the first biracial democracy by incorporating formerly enslaved people into the country's political and economic life. That period, known as Reconstruction, was destroyed primarily by the violence of White men who used terrorist and vigilante groups like the KKK to assassinate elected officials, prevent Blacks from voting and overthrow state governments.\n\nIn 1898, for example, a mob of primarily White men staged a coup against the city government of Wilmington, North Carolina, which had elected a multiracial coalition of leaders. More than 60 Black people were killed, and Black residents of the city were barred from voting, and from elected office, for decades afterward.\n\nThe January 6 insurrection wasn't unprecedented. In many ways it was a sequel.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned the GOP that \"We're not generating enough angry White guys to stay in business for the long term.\"\n\nHe was wrong. The angry White guy business is booming. Yet no matter how obvious it becomes that the country has a problem with White male violence, most Americans will escape what Black and brown men experience on a weekly basis.\n\nNot many drivers will lock their doors when White men approach at a stoplight. Few women will clutch their purse when they pass a White man on the street.\n\nSomeone recently posted a meme about this double standard by evoking the memory of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Black boy who was killed in Cleveland by a police officer who authorities said mistook his toy pistol for a real firearm.\n\n\"Tamir Rice was 12 and killed for having a fake toy gun. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, killed two people. Walked by police after killing two people. Got to go home and sleep.\"\n\nThat meme is why it's hard for me for to tolerate hearing another lecture about \"Black thug culture\" or a \"Black culture of violence.\"\n\nMy response to the White men who use these tired phrases: Look in the mirror.\n\nAnd look at these three trials, because they point to one frightening future. This is what that future looks like: More angry White men emboldened by \"stand your ground\" and citizen's arrest laws, inspired by a conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment.\n\nAnd more dead Americans.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man\n\nThe Brute. The Buck . And, of course, the Thug .\n\nThose are just some of the names for a racial stereotype that has haunted the collective imagination of White America since the nation's inception.\n\nThe specter of the angry Black man has been evoked in politics and popular culture to convince White folks that a big, bad Black man is coming to get them and their daughters.\n\nI've seen viral videos of innocent Black men losing their lives because of this stereotype. I've watched White people lock their car doors or clutch their purses when men who look like me approach. I've been racially profiled.\n\nIt's part of the psychological tax you pay for being a Black man in America - learning to accept that you are seen by many as Public Enemy No. 1.\n\nBut as I've watched three separate trials about White male violence unfold across the US these past few weeks - the Kyle Rittenhouse trial , the Ahmaud Arbery death trial and the civil case against organizers of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville - I've come to a sobering conclusion:\n\nThere is nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man.\n\nIt's not the \"radical Islamic terrorist\" that I fear the most. Nor is it the brown immigrant or the fiery Black Lives Matter protester, or whatever the latest bogeyman is that some politician tells me I should dread.\n\nIt's encountering an armed White man in public who has been inspired by the White men on trial in these three cases.\n\nHere's what legal experts say helped acquit Kyle Rittenhouse\n\nI'm not suggesting we start racially profiling White men. The vast majority of White men are no menace to society.\n\nCountless White men swallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year's protests over the murder of George Floyd. Plenty of White men - like the Rev. James Reeb, a White Unitarian minister - died for Black people during the civil rights movement.\n\nThere is nothing inherently violent about White men, or any human being.\n\nBut recent events have convinced me it's time to put another character on trial: A vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they \"can rule and brutalize without consequence.\"\n\nThis angry White man has been a major character throughout US history. He gave the country slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nIt's this angry White man - not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night - who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America.\n\nThat's a sweeping claim. But these trials represent something bigger than questions of individual guilt or innocence. They offer a disturbing vision of the future, and a choice about what kind of country we want to live in.\n\nThe facts of the trials are well known to many Americans.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty of all charges in the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during a racial protest last year. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, said he was in Kenosha during the protests after the police shooting of Jacob Blake to help protect property. He said he shot the men in self-defense.\n\nIn Georgia, three White men are accused of chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, last year while he was jogging. The men say they were trying to conduct a lawful citizen's arrest, and the man who shot Arbery says he acted in self-defense.\n\nAnd in Virginia, a civil trial is underway to determine if organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally intended to incite racial violence. One person was killed and dozens injured there after White supremacists clashed with counter-demonstrators.\n\nRace is an inescapable theme that runs through all the trials. At the center of each are White men who are accused of using unjustified violence, either against an unarmed Black man or during racial protests. In Rittenhouse's case, a jury cleared him of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nIt's what's happening outside these courtrooms, though, that is most frightening. It suggests these trials are a symptom of a dangerous shift.\n\nIf there was an Exhibit A to describe this shift, it might be an animé video. Earlier this month, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar posted a photoshopped animé video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him attacking President Joe Biden and appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword.\n\nThe House voted this week to censure Gosar, with virtually no Republicans backing the resolution. Gosar took down the video after facing criticism but did not apologize, and later retweeted a post that contained the video.\n\nGosar's video wasn't an isolated incident. Violent political rhetoric has been escalating among some members of the Republican Party. And while not all of it is fueled by White men, much of it starts at the top - with former President Donald Trump .\n\nTrump's violent and sexist rhetoric has been well-documented. More White men now identify as Republican, and the gender gap between both major parties is as large as it's ever been in the last two decades.\n\nOne New York Times columnist, under the headline \" The Angry White Male Caucus,\" said this anger is driven by White men who fear a changing America \"in which the privilege of being a white man isn't what it used to be.\"\n\nThe anger also seems to be getting worse. After President Joe Biden signed an infrastructure bill into law this month, some House Republicans who voted for it reported receiving death threats. Election officials and school board members across the country are also reporting escalating threats.  A recent poll revealed that 30% of Republicans believe that violence is justified to save the country.\n\nPolitical violence is not limited to the GOP. A Bernie Sanders supporter who publicly declared his hatred of conservatives shot five people at a Republican baseball practice in 2017.\n\nBut talking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal - and seemingly acceptable - in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month:\n\n\"When do we get to use the guns? ...

      "text": "When the dreaded 'other' is an angry white man\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham once delivered an odd warning.\n\n\"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term,\" he said , while attending the 2012 Republican National Convention.\n\nNo one is making that complaint anymore.\n\nLately, the news seems filled with grim mug shots of angry white guys. A white man allegedly kills two black people at a supermarket after failing minutes earlier to enter a black church. Another opens fire at a yoga studio, killing two people and injuring five more before turning the gun on himself. And a third is accused of massacring 11 worshippers at a synagogue, afterward yelling , \"I just want to kill Jews.\"\n\nYet during this same period, Trump and others have warned Americans of another threat: a caravan of Latino migrants headed toward the United States to seek asylum. They've alternately said the caravan is filled with gang members, \"Middle Easterners\" and even people with rabies. Trump also announced plans to deploy as many as 15,000 US troops to repel the \"invasion\" and warned that if any of the caravan's migrants threw rocks at troops, they could be shot - a threat he later denied.\n\nNo one is saying the recent spate of shootings can be blamed on the GOP. But the contrast between the terror that many Americans actually experience and the specter of violence that Trump invoked is a classic example of an insidious form of racism that some say is pervasive, though seldom acknowledged:\n\nAngry white men seeing \"primitive aggressions\" in others that they refuse to see in themselves:\n\nWhite men warn the public about vicious Central American gangs invading the United States, even though white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group. Some white men say \"radical Islamic terrorists\" represent the gravest threat to America, even though far-right violent extremist groups are responsible for more deadly incidents in America since 9/11. Some white men, such as white nationalists who rallied last year in Charlottesville, Virginia, say they are in danger of being replaced by nonwhites, even though they still make up the vast majority of the country's CEOs , billionaires and political leaders .\n\nPsychologists have a name for this kind of pattern. It's called projection and happens when people or groups of people project hidden or repressed elements of themselves onto others. But if you're a member of a group that's been deemed \"the other\" by an angry white man, like Ijeoma Oluo is, this pattern is business as usual.\n\nRelated article 72 hours in America: Three hate-filled crimes. Three hate-filled suspects.\n\nThere is nothing more frightening to her than an angry white man, she writes in an essay that went viral called, \"The Anger of the White Male Lie.\"\n\nOluo wrote that she constantly lives with the fear that the anger of white men can turn violent toward her and \"countless other black people, brown people, disabled people, queer people, trans people, and women of every demographic.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's really everywhere,\" says Olou of this anger. \"Every single day it becomes more of a problem.\n\n\"We have pipe bombs,\" she says. \"We have shooting in synagogues. It's literally killing people.\"\n\nThis may sound like hyperbole. But no one is saying that all white men are inherently violent or that they are the biggest threat to America. To make sweeping generalizations about any group is to make the same mistake that racists and anti-Semites make.\n\nSome nonwhite men are responsible for violence in America. Four of the most recent terrorist attacks - in San Bernardino , Boston , Chattanooga and Fort Hood - allegedly were committed by Muslim terrorists. And, of course, the September 11 terrorist attacks were committed by Muslims.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant did kill Mollie Tibbetts , a 20-year-old Iowa student, and a grinning Mexican man featured in a Trump campaign ad did kill two California deputies.\n\nRelated video CNN fact-checks Trump's racially charged ad\n\nYet there is a surprising body of work in literature and psychology that speaks to this tendency of some white people - in particular, white men - to quickly see the face of terror in an \"other.\" They do so by projecting some of the uglier, repressed aspects of themselves onto others.\n\nThis form of racism as projection is part of what the author James Baldwin wrote about in his essay, \"Letter from a Region in My Mind.\" He wrote that the racial tensions menacing America \"are involved only symbolically with color.\"\n\n\"These tensions are rooted in the very same depths as those from which love springs, or murder. The white man's unadmitted - and apparently, to him, unspeakable - private fears and longings are projected onto the Negro.\"\n\nThis form of projection formed the psychological backdrop for slavery.\n\nWhite male slave owners in the United States described their slaves as hypersexual beasts who craved sex - while they raped enslaved women and tortured enslaved men.\n\nWhite male slave owners called slaves lazy and shiftless - while they sat on porches sipping mint juleps watching them work from sunrise to sunset.\n\nThis was the form of projection that the late Winthrop D. Jordan described in a classic book on race that looked at the history of white attitudes toward race and slavery called, \"White Over Black: American Attitudes toward the Negro, 1550-1812.\"\n\n\"White men were attempting to destroy the living image of primitive aggressions which they said was the Negro but was really their own,\" Jordan wrote.\n\nBut this form of projecting is not confined to race. It fuels anti-Semitism, says Kenneth M. Reeves, a psychologist and author of the paper, \"Racism and projection of the shadow.\"\n\nThe Nazis justified their genocidal treatment of Jews by labeling them greedy money-grubbers - while collecting gold fillings from the teeth of Jewish corpses, Reeves wrote.\n\n\"The Nazis said, 'Look at the Jews. They're rapacious.' And then they went around looting the wealth of Europe,\" Reeves told CNN.\n\nOne of the deadly aspects of projection is that those who do it are often unaware of what they're doing, Reeves says. He says projection is so common that it is a \"universal daily drama\" that prevents a person who is doing the projecting from really seeing \"the other\" in their full humanity.\n\nHe wrote: \"The world and its inhabitants are not seen and understood for who they are, but as supposed by evil and wicked mirrors of one's own unknown self.\"\n\nWhen yours is the unwilling reflection in such a wicked mirror, the issue isn't abstract. Understanding it, even if it's only instinctive, can be the key to survival.\n\nAs a black man working in a corporate setting, I've noticed a pattern about large and dark men of color. They de-emphasize their physicality, often stooping as they smile excessively and even raise the pitch of their voices so it won't sound too commanding.\n\nYou don't want a white man projecting his need to dominate onto you, so you adjust your behavior.\n\nSometimes it happens with a woman who is seen as \"angry\" by a white man.\n\nAfter Oluo wrote her essay on white male anger, a white man wrote her a fuming letter, telling her to be \"less angry.\"\n\n\"He says 'less angry,'\" she wrote, \"as if I am not currently adding his email into a file with countless other long-winded missives, dismissals and violent threats from white men who decided to take the time out of their day to let me know in sometimes very disturbing ways that they need me to be 'less angry.'\"\n\nBut this form of projection goes beyond the personal; it shapes our politics.\n\nThere are people who divide America between red and blue states, but the true fault line may lie between angry white males and the rest.\n\nRelated article Women are angry at Trump and his party. And it's not just about Kavanaugh\n\nSen. Graham may no longer have to worry. The Republicans are becoming what some call the \" Angry White Male Caucus .\"  Already overwhelmingly white, the GOP is seeing a departure of women. Some blame it on the party's general attitude toward the #MeToo campaign and its support of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was recently confirmed to the court after accusations of sexual assault, which he denied.\n\nIndeed, the Republicans have become so associated with white male anger that one humorist recently suggested \"Americans would feel safer if a huge caravan of angry white men left the country.\"\n\nThe Rev. Gibson Stroupe knows something about white male anger. He says he was once gripped by it. He grew up in the segregated South, where he says he used the N-word and remembered once hatching a plan as a teenager to grab a hunting rifle with his friends to harass a man who was attempting to integrate a university in Mississippi.\n\nHe says he changed because of his faith combined with forging interracial friendships. He has written extensively and lectured widely on racism.\n\nHe sees some of the anger he once felt in how some white men reacted to the election of the nation's first black president.\n\n\"That was pretty shocking to a lot of us white people, especially white males,\" says Stroupe, author of \"Deeper Water: Sermons for a New Vision.\" \"We're not accustomed to African-American men having power over us.\"\n\nHe says one of the ways that some white men deal with that fear is projecting their own violence onto black men.\n\n\"White men recognize how much we've done to black people, especially black men,\" he says. \"Our longing to hold onto our guns so tightly - we do believe if black men get power over us they're going to do to us what we've done to them.\"\n\nThis form of projection has become a powerful political tool, says the Rev. Fred Robinson, executive director of MeckMin, a non-profit interfaith group that sponsored an interfaith service in Charlotte, North Carolina, to support members of the Pittsburgh synagogue that was attacked.\n\nPolitical leaders who project give whites someone to blame when they struggle, he says.\n\n\"Scare the rank-and-file whites to believe that somebody else is the problem: Jews are the problem. Blacks are the problem. Mexicans are the problem. Homosexuals are the problem. It works magically because it's baked in our cultural narrative,\" says Robinson, an associate pastor at Holy Covenant United Church of Christ in Charlotte.\n\nRobinson says he can envision a future where some angry white men will create an apartheid-like political system in the United States where they are able to hold onto power despite becoming a racial minority .\n\n\"The nation will become more bifurcated and will descend into these tribal spaces that I don't think will be good for us,\" he says. \"I do anticipate a lot more pain.\"\n\nAnd more replays of the psychological drama that lurks behind some of the nation's most tragic events.\n\nThat would mean more white male anger. More warnings of the \"others\" invading the United States. More attacks as some white men see others as \"wicked mirrors\" of their own hidden selves.\n\nIn that kind of world, there won't be any shortage of angry white men.\n\nAnd for those who are part of \"the other,\" it means one thing: We will continue to pay the price.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The hottest trend in executive leadership: Bring back the White Guy\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here .\n\nListen up, corporate boards: If you're looking for the biggest trend in leadership this fall, look no further. Corporate America's hottest CEO pick is a classic model - the Middle Aged White Guy.\n\nTwenty-twenty-four has been the year of CEO turnover, with some 1,450 having announced their departure so far - up 15% from the same period last year and the highest year-to-date total on record, according to research from executive coaching and outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Companies are increasingly opting to fill those vacant top jobs with a man, the data show.\n\nIn August, the rate of new CEOs who are women fell 0.7% to 27.2% compared with the same period last year.\n\nRelated article Companies are caving to anti-DEI crusaders. That's bad for business\n\nAnd of course, the ranks of women and people of color have always been thin. Just 52 businesses in the 2024 Fortune 500 ranking were run by women, holding flat from the year before.\n\nObviously, White Guy CEO never went out of fashion - women have rarely represented more than 10% of Fortune 500 companies. People of color are also wildly underrepresented in the C-suite, with just eight Black CEOs in the Fortune 500 this year (down from a peak of nine last year).\n\nBut a rash of recent leadership shakeups illustrates the enduring power of the White Guy as a kind of capsule wardrobe for corporate leadership.\n\nSee here:\n\nTo be clear: What a board decides to do with its chief executive is the board's business. But DEI initiatives have been shown to boost profits, reduce employee attrition and increase employee motivation, as my colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn has reported.\n\nRelated article Two of America's most prominent Black business leaders have a warning for companies abandoning DEI\n\nLeadership diversity, in particular, is associated with \"holistic growth ambitions, greater social impact, and more satisfied workforces,\" according to McKinsey research.\n\nThe business case is clear. But the reversion to the mean of a White male CEO also is happening at the same time that many firms are backing off their early-2020s commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. All of that coincides with the Supreme Court's decision last year to end affirmative action in colleges.\n\nIn other words, giant US institutions have created a permission structure for businesses to revert to muscle memory. There may have been a moment, circa 2020-2022, when replacing a person of color or a woman with a White man may have sparked a public relations debacle.\n\nClearly, major companies don't seem to be sweating the optics anymore.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "The white man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Black teen who rang a wrong doorbell dies\n\nFollow:\n\nAn 86-year-old Kansas City man has died just days after pleading guilty to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl , a Black honor student who rang the white man's doorbell by mistake, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\n\nAndrew Lester was charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and is now a freshman at Texas A&M. Before his trial was scheduled to begin, Lester pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge of second-degree assault, which carries up to seven years behind bars. He was scheduled to be sentenced on March 7.\n\nCher Congour, a spokeswoman for the Clay County prosecutor's office, said Lester's attorney called the office and the court, and informed them of his death.\n\n\"We have learned of the passing of Andrew Lester and extend our sincere condolences to his family during this difficult time,\" the prosecutor's office said in a news release. \"While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr. Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case.\"\n\nThe news release offered no cause of death.\n\nThe case shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the U.S.\n\nYarl showed up on Lester's doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings.\n\nLester's attorney, Steve Salmon, had argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm.\n\nYarl testified at a hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed \"longer than normal.\" As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door, assuming he was at his brothers' friends' parents.\n\nHe said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, \"Don't come here ever again.\" Although the bullet didn't penetrate Yarl's brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later.\n\nHis family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they had filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic.\n\nSalmon said last year that Lester's physical and mental condition had deteriorated . He said Lester had heart issues, a broken hip and had been hospitalized. Lester also lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received.\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, the judge asked Lester whether he was in poor health. Lester responded yes.\n\n\"Ralph is doing his best to be okay,\" a spokesperson for the family said in a text.\n\nA judge had previously ordered a mental evaluation of Lester but allowed for the trial to proceed after its completion. The results of that evaluation were not released publicly.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Hutchinson told CNN on Sunday it was the first Black Lives Matter protest he attended, and he helped the white man on Saturday because he didn't want the main reason for the protests to be lost in one moment of violence.\n\nProtesters in London and all over the world have taken to the streets calling for police reform after the deaths of black people at the hands of police. These deaths most recently include George Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta .\n\n\"My real focus was on avoiding a catastrophe, all of a sudden the narrative changes into 'Black Lives Matters, Youngsters Kill Protesters.' That was the message we were trying to avoid,\" Hutchinson said.\n\nHutchinson told CNN he initially saw the man lying on some stairs in the fetal position surrounded by protesters.\n\nAt that moment, he said it didn't cross his mind the man may be a counter protester or hold prejudices, but he was trying to get him out safely.\n\n\"I have no idea who this man was. All I know is that he was there, up to no good, let's just say,\" Hutchinson told CNN on Monday. \"He wasn't here to support Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nMore than 100 people were arrested in London protests Saturday after violence broke out as far-right groups targeted BLM protests. CNN has not been able to independently verify what the injured man was doing at the protest before the incident or why he was there. CNN has not yet been able to identify the injured protester.\n\nWhen Hutchinson saw the man, he said he and his friends formed a cordon around him and Hutchinson scooped him up to take him directly to the police. While they were marching, the man could still feel people trying to hit him, Hutchinson said.\n\n\"I am carrying him, my friends are protecting myself and the man on my shoulder. He was still receiving blows, you can feel people trying to hit him,\" he said. \"There were people trying to protect him at the same time carried him over to the police and I said here you are. One of them said 'thank you - you did a good thing there.'\"\n\nHutchinson attended the protests Saturday because \"history was in the making,\" he said, and it was a \"no brainer\" to support the cause. He added that he would like to break down the race barriers and for people to realize, \"we are all one race.\"\n\n\"I want to see equality for everybody. I am a father, a grandfather and I would love to see my young children, my young grandchildren, my nieces, my nephews have a better world than I have lived in,\" Hutchinson said. \"The world I live in has been better than my grandparents and my parents and hopefully we can continue until we have total equality for everyone.\"\n\nHutchinson said he's glad people look at the image as one of humanity and that people all over the world can learn from it, especially police officers in the US.\n\n\"Just because somebody's up to no good, doesn't mean you have to kill them,\" he said.\n\nSalma Abdelaziz and Zahid Mahmood reported from London and Amir Vera reported and wrote in Atlanta.

      "text": "They grew up surrounded by racism. But early on they chose a different path\n\nHe's been called a \"racist P.O.S.\" and accused of indoctrinating students. He lost the job he loved. The constant attacks have reduced him to tears.\n\nMatt Hawn has become a focal point of one of this past year's biggest racial controversies. The former public high school teacher in Tennessee was thrust into the national spotlight after he was fired from his tenured job for the way he taught students about White privilege .\n\nHawn became one of the most prominent casualties in an ongoing debate over how racism and history should be taught to students in the US. His plight has divided people in his conservative, heavily White city near the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nBut Hawn's improbable personal journey is as dramatic as the headlines he's provoked.\n\nThere is nothing in his background that suggests that he'd take such a public stand against racism. Hawn grew up in a White community and says he didn't have a single nonwhite classmate from kindergarten through high school. He says he was surrounded by people who used the N-word, flew Confederate flags and wore T-shirts declaring \"The South Will Rise Again.\"\n\nSo why did he turn out differently?\n\nOne way to answer that question is to examine a group of Americans who rarely come up in discussions about race. They are White people who grew up in families and communities where racism was the norm, but they rejected those beliefs early on. They zigged when everyone else around them zagged.\n\nThese aren't the type of people who made headlines in 2021, when White supremacists waved a Confederate flag at the US Capitol on January 6, racist conspiracy theories entered mainstream politics and new voter suppression laws were enacted across the nation.\n\nIt's easy to conclude after the events of this past year that human beings are too tribal to see past color, and racism is a \" permanen t feature of American life.\"\n\nYet these racial non-conformists show that even the most unlikely people can change.\n\nNone of them claim they are free of racism. As children some of them absorbed the attitudes they saw in their family or friends.\n\nBut people like Hawn possessed an innate ability to self-correct when they were young and defy expectations at an age when the pressure to conform is the highest.\n\nThese outliers appear in history books, in news stories and in public life. Many can't explain why they turned out so different.\n\nHawn, 43, says when he was growing up his family never talked about racism.\n\n\"There wasn't anyone to have these conversations with,\" he says. \"It's really hard to talk about racism in the US without someone who experienced it.\"\n\nA closer look at people like Hawn reveals at least four traits that they all share.\n\nDuring the height of the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020, filmmaker Kasi Lemmons wrote a searing essay titled, \"White Americans, your lack of imagination is killing us.\"\n\nLemmons, director of \"Harriet\" and \"Eve's Bayou,\" said pervasive racism exists because many White people cannot imagine what it's like to be Black. They can't imagine what it's like to be murdered by a police officer or to experience the constant vulnerability of dealing with racism every day.\n\n\"As a filmmaker, I help people imagine what's it's like to be someone else, to experience things from a character's point of view - things they never will experience outside the theater,\" she wrote. \"But when it comes to black life in America, there's only one conclusion I can reach about some white people: You don't care to put yourself in our shoes.\"\n\nYet there are some White people who can imagine what it's like to be an outsider - because they are outsiders themselves.\n\nHawn was diagnosed at age 13 with Type I diabetes. He had to carry his blood-sugar meter everywhere, and insulin  to his baseball games.  He was painfully thin.\n\n\"I was very sick for a long time,\" Hawn says. \"My entire seventh-grade year I was sick.\"\n\nThe illness made him stand out at a young age.\n\nRhonda Hawn, his mother, says she had a friend who gave birth to twin boys with Down syndrome. Her son was one of the few boys in their community who would visit them and take them outside to play baseball.\n\n\"Matt has always had an empathy for anyone who is different,\" she says. \"That made him totally different from his peers. \"None of his peers were diabetic. He knew what it was like to be different, not because of his skin color but in other ways.\"\n\nMany White progressives say they were transformed by a close relationship or a memorable encounter with a nonwhite person.\n\nCharles Black, Jr. was a White man who grew up in Texas during the Jim Crow era, believing that Black people were inferior. Then he met a Black man that changed his life.\n\nIn 1931, Black went to a hotel in Austin, Texas, to hear jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong play. He knew nothing about jazz, but something shifted in him as he watched a rapturous Armstrong perform.\n\n\"He was the first genius I'd ever seen,\" Black recalled in a Yale Review essay . \"It is impossible to underestimate the significance of a 16-year-old Southern boy seeing genius for the first time in a black person. We literally never saw a black man in anything but a servant's capacity.\n\n\"Louis opened my eyes wide and put to me a choice: Blacks, the saying went, were 'all right in their place,' but what was the place of such a man, and of the people from which he sprung?\"\n\nBlack would go on to join a team of lawyers that successfully convinced the US Supreme Court to overturn the segregation of students based on race in the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision.\n\nHawn had a similar experience. He says he began to question what many of his peers believed when he met a Black teenager in an American Legion program designed to promote teenage boys' civic engagement. The teens spent a week together with others in a dormitory. Hawn bonded with his new friend over their love of hip hop music, sports and girls.\n\n\"He was the first African-American person I'd ever befriended,\" Hawn says. \"I just remember him being just like me and my friends, somebody I could instantly make a connection with.\"\n\nThe transformative power of interracial relationships has been so well documented by social scientists that there's a name for it: \"contact theory.\" That's the term that Gordon Allport, one of the towering figures of psychology in the 20th century, used to describe experiences similar to Hawn's.\n\nIn one of his most famous studies, Allport conducted surveys of White soldiers who fought alongside Black soldiers during World War II. He discovered that in companies with both Black and White platoons, White soldiers disliked Black people far less than did White soldiers who served in segregated units.\n\nBut Allport found it was not enough for Whites and non-Whites to simply know one another. Other conditions also had to be met, such as personal interaction, equal status and both groups sharing common goals. Allport's findings, which were replicated with civilians in varying settings, proved that hatred and racism stem from lack of contact, the historian Rutger Bregman wrote in an essay describing Allport's work.\n\n\"We generalize wildly about strangers because we don't know them,\" Bregman wrote. \"So the remedy seemed obvious: more contact.\"\n\nThe Rev. Gibson \"Nibs\" Stroupe comes from an even harsher racial environment than Hawn. He grew up in Helena, Arkansas, during the Jim Crow era.\n\nStroupe was a boy when a group of Black students braved jeering White mobs to integrate White public schools in Little Rock. The President of the United States had to summon federal troops to protect them. The Black students were dubbed \"the Little Rock Nine.\"\n\nStroupe cast his sympathies with the mob. He thought Black people were inferior, almost like animals. He couldn't imagine sharing classrooms with them.\n\n\"No one ever sat down with me and told me that Black people were inferior,\" he says. \"It was just in the air; you breathed it in.\"\n\nThen one day Stroupe opened a book. He was a junior in high school when a teacher handed him a copy of \" Cry, the Beloved Country \" by Alan Paton. The novel is a classic that focuses on a rural Black pastor's search for his missing son against the backdrop of apartheid South Africa.\n\nThe pastor's search stirred painful feelings for Stroupe. His own father had abandoned him when he was a kid. The pastor's earnestness and kindness touched him. Stroupe wished his father would search for him.\n\nSomething in him shifted. He began to think of the Black people he made fun of his in his hometown.\n\n\"I remember looking up from the book's page and thinking, 'Gosh, they might be like us.\"\n\nStroupe, now 75, became a civil rights activist, an award-winning author and one of the nation's most prominent anti-racist speakers. He and his wife, Caroline Leach, became co-pastors of Oakhurst Presbyterian Church in Decatur, Georgia, whose successful efforts to build a vibrant interracial congregation drew national attention and became a model for others.\n\nSome stories are so powerful that they can change White people who grew up in even the most racially isolated circumstances.\n\nCharissa Johnson was raised in a fundamentalist Christian community in rural Colorado that cut off contact from much of the world. She was home-schooled, and the people she encountered were almost entirely White.\n\nRacism in her town was common, she says. She heard people say that Blacks were lazy and lived off government handouts. Townspeople openly opposed interracial marriages. She occasionally heard them use the N-word.\n\n\"If we saw a Black person walking down the street, someone would say, 'Oh be careful. Lock your car doors,' \" she says.\n\nBut Johnson says she rejected much of this thinking because of her love of reading. She recalled one book in particular. Titled \"Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters: An African Tale ,\" it was a lavishly illustrated folktale set in Zimbabwe that centered on a father's attempt to marry one of his two daughters to a king. The book portrays the African girls as beautiful and intelligent and the father as noble and wise.\n\nJohnson started reading other African folk tales. Then she read the \" The Diary of Anne Frank.\" The girls in the books looked different than her, but she shared many of their dreams and hopes.\n\n\"I was curious about the world and about people, and finding connection with those people in the books helped break down a lot of the us-versus-them mentality I learned,\" says Johnson, now 35. The stories inspired her to take a stand when she was in the fourth grade.\n\nShe was attending a home-school enrichment program with other students when she noticed how a Black girl was being treated. None of the White students would play with the Black girl in their physical education class. Young Charissa approached the girl, introduced herself, and asked if they could be PE partners.\n\n\"It didn't just make sense to me,\" she says. \"Nobody ever wanted to partner with her. And so we became friends. We would run together, and she became my buddy. It was a lot of fun.\"\n\nDuring many of his sermons, Stroupe made an observation that made some White parishioners squirm in their seats.\n\nHe said he didn't learn racism from unapologetic racists like members of the Ku Klux Klan. Nice White people taught him how to hate.\n\n\"I had been taught racism by my family, my church, and my teachers - by really decent white people in my hometown on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River Delta,\" Stroupe wrote in a 2018 essay in The Atlantic.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges any White racial non-conformist faces is being expelled by their tribe. It's hard to break from family and friends who see you as an oddity or a traitor.\n\nStroupe had to break with his mother, Mary, who viewed the civil rights movement with suspicion. When he was a teenager, he started to ask her about it to sort through his evolving perspective.\n\n\"Don't mess with this, Nibs, and don't fret about it,\" she told him. \"It is not our business.\"\n\nHe didn't take his mother's advice. After high school, he enrolled in a church program that took him to New York City where he forged friendships with Black people for the first time. He became a civil rights activist. He even dated a Black woman. He decided to go into the ministry.\n\nWhen he returned to Arkansas to bring the good news to the nice White people in his church, many rejected him. Church elders told him that going to the North had corrupted him.\n\n\"They said that I had gotten 'Yankified,' \" Stroupe recalls.\n\nBut Stroupe was willing to jeopardize the relationship with his mother and his community for his beliefs in racial justice.\n\nAnd eventually, his mother became a convert and supported his civil rights activism. Stroupe, the author of five books, is currently working on a memoir about his relationship with his mother.\n\n\"I learned from my mother and church that God loved me and God loved everybody,\" he says. \"The question was, who is everybody? Once I could make that connection with Black people being part of everybody, then that was really it.\"\n\nHawn, too, is paying the price for his beliefs.\n\nHis parents have stood behind him. But some people in his staunchly conservative community denounced him on Facebook, and the lengthy dismissal process, which ended with his firing last May, has worn him down at times.\n\nSchool board members said they didn't fire Hawn because he taught students about White privilege. They said he treated the concept as a fact, and didn't offer students opposing points of view.\n\nHawn's firing came the same month that Tennessee legislators passed a law dictating how public school teachers should talk about race in classrooms. The law was passed as heated debates spread nationwide over critical race theory , the idea that systemic racism is part of American history and institutions, and that racism remains an everyday experience for most people of color.\n\nA school official said Hawn's firing had nothing to do with the passage of the law.\n\nThe school board voted in December to uphold Hawn's firing. He's considering appealing the decision.\n\nHawn says he misses teaching and has financial worries now. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help him.\n\n\"What am I going to do for health insurance?\" he says. \"I'm a Type 1 diabetic.\"\n\nBut he still calls himself an \"anti-racist teacher,\" and says there's a need for people like him in small towns.\n\n\"If I didn't teach those lessons, I wouldn't be doing my job,\" he says. \"It's important for teachers to see, in light of these bills and laws, that if you get caught up in all of this (debate over teaching about racism) that there are people out there to support you.\n\n\"And if no one does, I will. At least you'll have one.\"\n\nBut even just one person who refuses to conform can change history. A South African man showed how.\n\nAbraham and Constand Viljoen were identical twin brothers and Afrikaners , members of South African's dominant White ethnic group.\n\nBoth were indoctrinated from birth to defend apartheid, the brutal system that denied Blacks and other people of color equal access to political and economic power. They were taught that Blacks were biologically inferior, and to dread the \"Black danger\" - a scenario in which armed Blacks would pillage and take over South Africa.\n\nBut then their paths diverged. Abraham became a minister, joined the underground resistance to apartheid and became a close ally of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first Black president.  His brother became chief of the South African Defense Force, which crushed Black dissent and, some say, assassinated Black activists. He was apartheid's ultimate enforcer.\n\nAfrikaners called Abraham Viljoen a traitor. But he helped save his country from a civil war in 1993 when he brokered a meeting between Mandela and his brother. Constand Viljoen's disdain for Mandela changed after he met the anti-apartheid legend over tea in Mandela's home. When Mandela was inaugurated a year after their meeting, Constand Viljoen saluted him in the halls of Parliament and would later call him \"the greatest of men.\"\n\nAbraham Viljoen's example could help us today.  The news is filled with stories about White people acting in blatantly racist ways. Racism can seem like apartheid once did: ineradicable.\n\nYet we are also surrounded by people like Abraham Viljoen. They show us that compassion can bloom in the most unexpected places. And while many people are taught to hate, there are others who seem born with the instinct to question those messages.\n\nIt's time we started paying more attention to them as well.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

He will be sentenced on March 7.\n\nHe entered court in a wheelchair.\n\nYarl's mother, Cleo Nagbe', put her arm around her son and asked if he was OK. Yarl nodded.\n\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson said after the court hearing that the outcome \"ensures accountability for the defendant, provides closure to Mr. Yarl, and satisfies the need to achieve a just result in the case.\"\n\nLester's trial had been scheduled to start Tuesday in Kansas City, Missouri. He had previously pleaded not guilty to one felony count each of first-degree assault and armed criminal action.\n\nYarl's family expressed frustration with the deal, saying it does not erase the trauma the boy and the family endured, nor does it address perceived failures in the justice system, including racial bias.\n\n\"While this marks a step toward accountability, true justice requires consequences that reflect the severity of his actions - anything less would be a failure to recognize the harm,\" the family said in a statement. \"This case has never been just about Ralph - it is about every child's right to exist without being seen as a threat.\"\n\nBefore the plea agreement, members of Yarl's family said that they had little trust in the Clay County Prosecuting Attorney's Office because they believe it had not worked aggressively enough for a conviction, said Faith Spoonmore, Yarl's aunt and the family's spokesperson.\n\nAs an example, she said, Thompson did not argue in the charging documents filed against Lester that race was a factor in the shooting.\n\n\"I don't think that the prosecutor's office is on our side,\" Spoonmore said before the deal was announced.\n\nThompson responded Friday, saying, \"We understand their frustration, but throughout this process our office has maintained regular and respectful communication with Mr. Yarl's family. They were consulted during the process.\"\n\nRace was a component in the case, but there was no evidence of racial motivation, Thompson said, adding he explored all aspects of the case.\n\nLester, who was charged with a felony count of first-degree assault and armed criminal action, shot Yarl with a handgun on April 13, 2023, when Yarl rang Lester's doorbell, mistaking it for the house where he was supposed to pick up his siblings.\n\nLester filed multiple shots, grazing Yarl in the head and striking him in the arm. Lester immediately called police, telling them he fired his gun because he was scared.\n\nStill, Spoonmore said, Lester should not have fired at her underage nephew.\n\n\"It's not OK for a child to be shot in the head for knocking on the wrong doorbell,\" she said.\n\nYarl, now 18, is in his first semester of college at Texas A&M. He declined to comment this week but told NBC News last year in his first in-depth interview about how the shooting affected him, that it had been \"a bumpy journey.\"\n\n\"Whenever there's something that goes on that reminds me of what happened ... I just have, like, such a negative wave of emotions, like anger, like disgust,\" he said. \"It's always a mix of good and bad days. And I feel like the good days are when I'm able to be around people that help me build myself up.\"\n\nSpoonmore said the engineering major plays bass clarinet in the school marching band and has made new friends.\n\n\"He likes it,\" his aunt said.\n\nRalph went home twice over the holidays, she said, making punch for Christmas and joining multiple family outings, but his reserved demeanor has not changed.\n\n\"He's still very quiet, doesn't say much,\" his aunt said. \"He's one of those people who doesn't talk.\"\n\nShe said family members did not broach the subject of the then-upcoming trial during his visits.\n\n\"It's not something that we bring up, but you can see it, you can feel it,\" Spoonmore said. \"Ralph has been doing his best, I'm so proud of that kid. He's trying to put his best foot forward.\"\n\nDeon J. Hampton is a national reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

His arraignment is set for Sept. 20.\n\n\"In Clay County, justice happens inside the courtroom,\" Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson told reporters after county Judge Louis Angles sent the case to trial.\n\nLester, who is free on bail, wore a white shirt under a dark sports coat in court Thursday and showed virtually no emotion during testimony.\n\nA prosecutor asked the victim, Ralph Yarl, how he was doing when he testified Thursday.\n\n\"Better than, say, four months ago,\" said Yarl, who wore a long- sleeve blue shirt and black pants.\n\nYarl recalled ringing the doorbell without any response for an extended amount of time.\n\nLester eventually came to the entrance, opened the interior wooden door, showed a gun and said, \"Don't come here ever again,\" Yarl said.\n\nYarl also testified that at that moment, he took his hand off the exterior glass storm door before he was shot in the head. He fell to the ground and was shot again, this time in the arm, he said.\n\nProsecutors asked Yarl whether he \"yanked violently\" or actually opened the glass storm door, and he said no both times.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Yarl said he had touched the man's door - which conflicted with earlier police interviews, in which he said he hadn't.\n\n\"It's important for the judge, when they're making a determination on probable cause, to hear the evidence. Part of the evidence was Ralph's testimony,\" Thompson said. \"Any time someone has to talk about a traumatic experience, it's not easy. So we respect all those who undergo that decision and make that decision to testify.\"\n\nAfter court, defense lawyer Steven Salmon refused to second-guess his client's actions.\n\n\"Once again, I think there's a judgment call. You're talking about an 84-year-old man who startled from sleep, and he just went to the door,\" he told reporters. \"I can't substitute my judgment for his. He's an 84-year-old man, and maybe his judgment is different than mine.\"\n\nThe shooting sparked another national conversation about the use of force, by police and others, against Black people.\n\nSeveral of Yarl's relatives were in court to support him, some wearing T-shirts that read, \"Ringing a doorbell is not a crime.\"\n\nYarl was 16 when he went out to pick up his younger brothers from a friend's house.\n\nHis mom had asked him to go to an address in Kansas City's Nashua neighborhood, a little more than 15 miles north of downtown. But he went to a similarly named \"street\" instead of the right address, which was a \"terrace,\" a short distance away.\n\nYarl said Thursday he didn't have his cellphone that night, having lost it at school several days earlier, the implication being he couldn't have called his mother to confirm the address after he rang the doorbell with no initial response.\n\nFaith Spoonmore, Yarl's aunt, praised him for answering questions so calmly under oath.\n\n\"He did amazing. He did so good,\" she told reporters. \"He did a lot better than I would have done, because I was sitting back there throwing punches in the air, and he was there so well-composed, answering those questions like he should have. And he spoke his truth, so I'm very proud of Ralph.\"\n\nLester, who lives alone, told police he had gone to bed before he heard his doorbell and believed Yarl was trying to break in.\n\nThe court also heard a 911 call in which Lester told a dispatcher that a Black man had come to his door: \"He was at my door trying to get in, and I shot him.\"\n\nBefore Yarl took the stand, three neighbors testified they heard the shots and Yarl banging on their doors, frantically asking for assistance.\n\nTwo of the neighbors testified they told Yarl to sit outside while they called for help. The prosecutor asked the neighbors whether they had thought about shooting Yarl, and they said no.\n\nSelina Guevara reported from Kansas City, Halle Lukasiewicz from Chicago and David K.

Bartlett must also perform 300 hours of community service and take anger management classes and racial sensitivity training. Bartlett could have faced decades in prison, but Miami-Dade County Judge Alberto Milian granted Bartlett a withhold of adjudication, which means Bartlett will avoid a formal conviction.\n\nBartlett had previously claimed he was acting in self-defense during the confrontation, but following a 2021 hearing Milian ruled that Bartlett did not act reasonably in getting out of his SUV and pulling a pistol on the teenage protesters who had stopped traffic near the Brickell Bridge in downtown Miami. Bartlett had testified that he was being held hostage as his SUV was stuck in traffic and that he was goaded into repeatedly using a slur. He acknowledged the slur is a derogatory term for a Black person but denied that it was racist.\n\nAs a condition of his plea agreement, Bartlett apologized in court Tuesday and admitted that his words were hateful.\n\nCellphone video taken by bystanders shows Bartlett carrying a handgun and yelling racial slurs at the teenagers on bicycles blocking traffic in downtown Miami.\n\nThe protest involved potential loss of affordable housing in the impoverished Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. It coincided with a much larger event, \"Wheels Up, Guns Down,\" that was timed to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day and involved mostly young Black men riding motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles in traffic, popping wheelies and riding while standing on the seats.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Lakota elders helped a white man preserve their language. Then he tried to sell it back to them.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nSTANDING ROCK INDIAN RESERVATION, S.D. - Ray Taken Alive had been fighting for this moment for two years: At his urging, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council was about to take the rare and severe step of banishing a nonprofit organization from the tribe's land.\n\nThe Lakota Language Consortium had promised to preserve the tribe's native language and had spent years gathering recordings of elders, including Taken Alive's grandmother, to create a new, standardized Lakota dictionary and textbooks.\n\nBut when Taken Alive, 35, asked for copies, he was shocked to learn that the consortium, run by a white man, had copyrighted the language materials, which were based on generations of Lakota tradition. The traditional knowledge gathered from the tribe was now being sold back to it in the form of textbooks.\n\n\"No matter how it was collected, where it was collected, when it was collected, our language belongs to us. Our stories belong to us. Our songs belong to us,\" Taken Alive, who teaches Lakota to elementary school students, told the tribal council in April.\n\nOn May 3, the tribal council voted nearly unanimously to banish the Lakota Language Consortium - along with its co-founder Wilhelm Meya and its head linguist, Jan Ullrich - from setting foot on the reservation. What the council took into consideration wasn't just the organization's dealings with the Standing Rock Sioux; it turned out at least three other tribes had also raised concerns about Meya, saying he broke agreements over how to use recordings, language materials and historical records, or used them without permission.\n\nMeya denies this. A spokesman shared letters of support for Meya's work from five tribes and tribal schools, though in recent interviews and statements to NBC News, officials with four of those tribes said they had concerns about Meya's methods.\n\nNative Americans have been mined for financial benefit and academic accolades for centuries. Information collected on Native Americans has rarely been taken with their consent or been used to serve their communities, whether through research done on Indigenous remains robbed from gravesites or on blood samples used without permission . Still, there are Lakota people who support what the consortium is doing: They say preserving the endangered language is paramount.\n\nThis work has been lucrative for Meya, who started the Lakota Language Consortium in Indiana in the early 2000s. He's also the CEO of The Language Conservancy, a nonprofit organization he founded soon afterward that works to revitalize other Indigenous languages.\n\nIn tax filings for 2020, Meya reported an annual salary of about $210,000 from his two nonprofit groups, according to tax disclosure documents. That kind of money bothers some in the Native American communities he's worked in; on the Standing Rock reservation, the median income is just over $40,000.\n\nMeya's organizations have received more than $3.5 million in federal grants over the past 15 years for language revitalization projects with tribes across the country, records show. The Department of Health and Human Services alone has paid the Lakota Language Consortium nearly $1 million to create some of the textbooks the organization sells for $40 to $50 apiece.\n\nMeya says his work is a vital tool in preserving the Lakota language, which did not previously have a standardized written form. He estimated that there are fewer than 1,500 fluent Lakota speakers left and that over the last decade and a half, the organization has helped add 50 to 100 more.\n\n\"Just because money is involved in it does not inherently make it an evil thing,\" Meya said in a recent interview with NBC News. Most of the products his organizations make are free, he said, but the cost of printing textbooks has to come from somewhere. \"That tends to be sometimes part of the rhetoric, 'Oh, there's money involved. It must be, you know, part of the overall colonization effort.' Well, you know, that's just not realistic.\"\n\nBut several Indigenous academics, legal experts and tribal leaders say the consortium is asserting control over more than the teaching materials it makes; it's the community-specific information and tribal history that's contained within the books. Some of the words and phrases in the consortium's materials have never been recorded or transcribed before, and charging a marginalized community any fee for them is unethical, the experts said.\n\nTaken Alive and a growing number of tribal citizens believe all the dictionaries, textbooks and recordings should be free and accessible to the Indigenous communities that created the languages the products teach.\n\nThe conflict is part of a bigger dispute over how to preserve Native American languages and oral histories and whether outsiders should be allowed to make money off of this work.\n\nEstimates vary, but there are slightly more than 100 Native American languages still spoken today, less than half of what existed before European colonization began. Whether through the destructive violence of Manifest Destiny or the assimilation efforts of the Indian boarding school era , the U.S. campaign to eliminate Native American languages has been highly effective. Most of those that remain are in danger of extinction. Many tribes, especially smaller ones with fewer resources, rely on non-Native organizations to preserve their languages.\n\nA common trait of Native American cultures is to hold things like land, resources and knowledge communally. That runs into conflict with U.S. copyright laws, which allow companies and nonprofit organizations to commoditize their work product - including pieces of a shared language.\n\nThe Lakota Language Consortium notes on its website that \"no one can copyright a language,\" and the consortium says it shares its materials with those who ask to make copies for educational purposes. But the copyright on the materials still gives the organization control over how the information is used, which is what some tribal leaders find objectionable.\n\nEven if a tribal nation has intellectual property laws protecting its cultural information, if it lacks the legal staff to assert control over that data, legal experts say it can still be vulnerable.\n\nThe debate over how information collected from tribes is handled has caught the attention of tribal citizens across the about half-dozen reservations where Lakota is a first language. The controversy has spilled into tribal politics and social media, igniting a fierce debate over identity, decolonization and tribal sovereignty.\n\nTribes in this situation are typically at a disadvantage, said Jane Anderson, an associate professor of anthropology and a legal scholar at New York University. Not only do tribes rarely share in the profits of language preservation efforts, they often have to pay part of the costs to implement them and have to purchase the end product, she said.\n\n\"There is something deeply unethical and inequitable in relation to that, and I hear it all the time across Indian Country,\" she said.\n\nMakalika Naholowa'a, a Native Hawaiian attorney and the executive director at the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, said when organizations that trade in Indigenous data don't freely share that information with the communities they gather it from, they are akin to miners or loggers, taking a valuable resource and selling it to whoever wants it.\n\n\"Data is the new oil,\" she said.\n\nRay Taken Alive started learning Lakota as a kid by listening to his grandmother Delores Taken Alive, who was a first-language speaker. She grew up in South Dakota, where her family had lived since long before their land was part of the United States. Delores was proud to have been given her Lakota name, Hiŋháŋ Sná Wiŋ, or Rattling Owl Woman, by her great-grandmother, who survived the massacre at Wounded Knee.\n\nAs a child, when Delores was drifting off to sleep, she listened to her parents and grandparents tell stories in Lakota, and that's how she learned the history of her people.\n\nWith the number of Lakota first-language speakers dwindling, Delores was eager to help preserve and transmit the language. Beginning in 2005, she recorded words and stories for Jan Ullrich, the linguist, and reviewed new entries in the Lakota Language Consortium's dictionary. She signed an agreement with the consortium that paid elders up to $50 per hour, in exchange for exclusive rights to publish what they shared.\n\nMeya said he considered Delores a friend and that she contributed important work to the dictionary. \"She's always wanted her stuff out there so much,\" he said. \"That's been her kind of cause.\"\n\nRay Taken Alive began formally learning Lakota in elementary school. He continued with classes in college and eventually used the curriculum his grandmother helped create, gradually piecing together his people's words. Over time, those words did what they've been doing since the beginning: They pieced him together, too, he said. They gave him a way of seeing his place in the world that only his ancestors could provide.\n\nAfter his grandmother died from Covid in 2020 at age 86, Taken Alive said he asked the consortium for her recordings. That's when he learned the organization retained the \"unrestricted permission to copyright\" and publish them, according to the agreement she signed.\n\nWhile the consortium eventually gave Taken Alive copies of his grandmother's tapes, he said that was the moment he was awoken to something bigger: the extent of the consortium's control over decades of information collected from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. His tribe had helped fund the consortium's effort and supported grants for it, according to tribal leaders, so he believed the Lakota people should have access to what came from it.\n\nTaken Alive decided to start testing the limits of the copyrights. Last year he posted some of the consortium's lessons in an online language-learning app. The data belongs to the tribe, he figured, and if the organization's stated purpose is to teach the language, then it should be readily available to Lakota people. But he said soon after posting, he received a copyright infringement notice from the consortium, and the app removed the lessons.\n\n\"So I'm supposed to ask the Lakota Language Consortium if I can use my own Lakota language,\" Taken Alive asked in one of many TikTok posts that would come to define his social media presence.\n\nA representative for the Lakota Language Consortium said in a statement that the group \"has always encouraged teachers to copy and share our Lakota language learning materials with their students. This is clearly different than someone copying the entirety of an author's work and distributing it as their own.\"\n\nMeya told the tribal council in April that the consortium had been working since 2018 to return all the language data it had collected. \"That's been our No. 1 interest for many years, as well as making sure that young people have as much access as possible to these materials,\" he said.\n\nBut the tribal council grew tired of waiting. This spring it hired an attorney to ensure recordings and writings from hundreds of Lakota speakers are returned.\n\nMeya was born in Vienna, grew up in Connecticut and moved to South Dakota to attend the Oglala Lakota College in the mid-1990s. That's when he became interested in Lakota language and history and began learning from tribal elders. But \"it was difficult for anyone to learn the language,\" he said, \"just because there were no materials and nothing very consistent there.\"\n\nMeya continued studying Lakota history in graduate school, and eventually he decided to start creating textbooks and lesson plans. He co-founded the Lakota Language Consortium while studying for his doctorate at Indiana University. Today, the consortium and Meya's other nonprofit organization, The Language Conservancy, work with dozens of tribal nations, including in Australia.\n\nMeya began working with Ullrich, who is now the head linguist at the Lakota Language Consortium, in 2002.\n\nUllrich grew up in the Czech Republic, and in the 1980s he joined a group of white hobbyists who appropriated Indigenous culture by dressing up as Native Americans, living in tipis and smoking peace pipes, which was captured in a 1995 documentary . After spending several years studying Lakota, Ullrich first visited the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1992 . He has spent his summers in the Dakotas working on a new Lakota dictionary and teaching since.\n\n\"In my capacity as a linguist, I've been doing my best to support the efforts,\" he said via email.\n\nMost people who have worked with Ullrich, both Native and non-Native, describe him as a capable teacher who is genuinely interested in revitalizing the language. But others have raised concerns about his past hobbyism and disagree with the way the consortium has standardized Lakota, making it easier to translate into languages like Czech and sell in translated texts, which he has done.\n\nMeya and Ullrich, as well as their supporters in tribal communities, describe Taken Alive's efforts to stop them as an orchestrated disinformation campaign.\n\n\"Our track record speaks for itself,\" Meya said. \"And it's beautiful, and amazing, and fantastic, and miraculous in every way. And, you know, if there's people that want to tear it down for their own personal, you know, agendas or whatever, that's unfortunate.\"\n\nMost of the Lakota Language Consortium's board members are Lakota, and a few of them came to April's tribal council meeting to defend the consortium's work as a vital tool for language preservation.\n\n\"I speak traditional Lakota, and I gave everything I had to this effort,\" said Ben Black Bear, the consortium's vice chairman and a citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. \"I don't care if they give me any copyrights or make money on me. I don't care. The objective is to get the language out there.\"\n\nOver the past two years, as Taken Alive began speaking out about Meya and Ullrich on social media, he connected with citizens and leaders of other tribes who raised similar concerns about the pair's practices.\n\nLast year, after Taken Alive confronted Meya at a conference run by the National Indian Education Association, the association asked The Language Conservancy to stop attending its conferences. Diana Cournoyer, the association's executive director and a citizen of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said she heard from several members of the association who voiced concerns about the conservancy either not sharing revenues with the communities that created the languages or not fully explaining the extent of its control over the material it collects.\n\nMeya said the tribal citizens who worked with his nonprofits were glad to help with language preservation and understood how their words would be used. \"They would seek out to be recorded,\" he said.\n\nThe situation should start a larger conversation about Indigenous data sovereignty , the ability of tribal nations to control their own information, Cournoyer said. \"It's time to have an open dialogue that results in a solution,\" she said.\n\nNaholowa'a, the Native Hawaiian attorney, said Indigenous people's demands to own their language and culture \"are rooted in their human rights.\"\n\nShe said federal law doesn't account for the way tribal nations communally preserve cultural and intellectual property or the often inequitable circumstances in which that information is taken.\n\nMost intellectual property attorneys have no understanding of the cultural implications at play, Naholowa'a said, putting tribes at the disadvantage of having to remain vigilant in protecting their citizens' data. Of the tens of thousands of intellectual property attorneys in the country, she's found only 14 who identify as Indigenous.\n\nAnderson, the New York University legal expert, said that just because the conservancy is operating legally does not mean its work is ethical.\n\n\"You make it free for the communities whose language it is - I mean, that's just basic ethics and responsibility,\" she said.\n\nWhile some tribal governments have been proactive by creating their own intellectual property laws or hiring attorneys to protect their information, many more have learned the limitations of property law the hard way.\n\nThe Pueblo of Acoma have been living on a mesa of golden stucco homes in central New Mexico for over 2,000 years, one of the longest continually inhabited villages on the continent.\n\nWhile the Pueblo's language, Keres, has been in use for thousands of years, like Lakota it was never put into a standardized written form. The Language Conservancy began working with the Pueblo to develop a dictionary and curriculum for teaching Keres in 2017.\n\nBut the Pueblo terminated its contract with the organization in 2019.\n\nAccording to a statement from tribal Gov. Randall Vicente's office, the conservancy's employees then tried to abscond with the data they had collected, as well as language materials developed by the tribe. In the statement, the office said employees of the conservancy loaded the materials into their cars, and tribal police were dispatched to pull them over and make them return the items.\n\n\"Despite these incidents, Acoma still was forced to negotiate with The Language Conservancy for the return of all its property,\" the governor's office said in the statement. It took more than a year for the organization to return everything, the office said.\n\nThe tribe's contract with the conservancy gave the nation rights over any intellectual property created. In 2020, the Pueblo of Acoma and The Language Conservancy signed a settlement saying that the conservancy could no longer teach Keres classes, according to the tribe.\n\nMeya called the criticisms \"inflammatory\" and \"untrue.\" He said his work with the tribe halted  after new tribal leaders abandoned the project. \"The Acoma story is very complex, mostly has to do with the change of leadership at the tribe,\" he said.\n\nFor Standing Rock Sioux Councilman Charles Walker, the moment that sealed the Lakota Language Consortium's banishment was when he learned of the Calico Winter Count.\n\nA lot of the information we have today on tribal nations - their relations with each other, changes in leadership and unique traditions - comes directly from Indigenous people themselves. Many bands of Plains tribes, like the Lakota, kept what are known as winter counts, pictorial histories drawn onto animal hides. Each one is a calendar stretched across the soft underside of a hide, every image capturing the most important event of that year, from first snow to first snow.\n\nGloria Runs Close To Lodge-Goggles said it was a great honor when she was chosen to keep the Calico Winter Count and its translations. Her ancestor Black Shield documented a multitude of events, including when he acted as Lakota Chief Red Cloud's interpreter during a diplomatic visit to Washington, D.C., in 1870.\n\nGoggles stored the audio and written translations at the Oglala Lakota College for safekeeping, only to be accessed by students with the family's permission.\n\nMeya got access to them while attending the college in the 1990s - without Goggles' knowledge, she said - and he soon began writing and lecturing on their contents. Meya said he received them with the permission of the college's archivist.\n\nIn 1998, Meya donated copies of the winter count translations to the University of Washington as source material to receive a grant.\n\nLater that year, Goggles obtained a cease-and-desist order from the Oglala Lakota Tribal Court requiring Meya to return all the materials and copies and to stop publishing or making presentations about the count. But Meya used the information in his 1999 master's thesis at the University of Arizona, in which he described the Calico Winter Count as \"a crucial type of indigenous data set\" and \"highly credible historical sources that can play central roles in the construction of tribal histories.\"\n\n\"It makes me angry, and it makes me sick,\" Goggles said. \"This is my history. This is my family. And nobody invited you to the table and gave you this information. You helped yourself to it.\"\n\nIn response to questions about Goggles' accusations, Meya said he didn't know that the family felt that way and that he would remove the family's items from the University of Washington archive. \"I respect the family in every way I can,\" he said, \"and if there's anything I can do, I will do that.\"\n\nNBC News followed up with additional questions about the cease-and-desist order; a representative for Meya referred questions to an Oglala Lakota College official who did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe ended its contract with the Lakota Language Consortium a few years ago, so banishing the organization and its leaders was in some ways symbolic.\n\nBut the resolution also contained provisions to assert the tribe's data sovereignty by establishing intellectual property rights. It reclaimed copyrights over all language materials created by the consortium and called for their immediate return, to be placed in the care of \"the first-language speakers and knowledge-keepers in our communities.\"\n\nAfter the May tribal council vote, the Lakota Language Consortium released a statement that said, \"It is incredibly upsetting that a resolution, instigated by a single Tribal member with a profound misunderstanding of what we do, has distorted our mission and mischaracterized our work.\"\n\nBut Councilman John Pretty Bear said the opposition to the consortium was far broader than Taken Alive.\n\n\"When you take it to elders who do speak that language on a daily basis and they say that this isn't right, that's who you listen to,\" Pretty Bear said in the May tribal council meeting. \"My elders in my community have seen the destructiveness to the language that these two gentlemen are creating again and the division that they're creating.\"\n\nOnce the tribe has the materials, including recordings and written translations, Taken Alive hopes to help the tribe create its own dictionary - and to dub episodes of \"The Office.\" He said elders are excited to develop their own methods of teaching Lakota. He's also been posting more lessons online.\n\n\"Now we can create whatever we want,\" he said. \"We don't have to ask anybody.\"\n\nIn a 2002 letter Goggles wrote to Lakota teachers who were involved in establishing the Lakota Language Consortium with Meya, she warned of the dangers of letting outsiders control the knowledge Lakota people safeguarded for so long.\n\n\"Language is one of our last true ties to our past, and we should determine how to teach our children the words their ancestors spoke,\" she wrote, before referencing Iktomi, a trickster of Lakota lore.\n\nTaken Alive said his interactions with the consortium also reminded him of a story he learned as a boy about Iktomi.\n\nIktomi was hungry, the story goes, and he saw a group of ducks along the water. Knowing they would fly away if he chased them, Iktomi decided to trick them. He bundled some straw in a cloth and walked over. The ducks knew to be wary of his tricks, but their curiosity got the better of them, and they asked what was in his bag.\n\n\"Just some songs I made,\" Iktomi told them. The ducks were having a dance and asked him to sing one, but Iktomi would only do so if the ducks kept their eyes closed. The song is sacred, he told them, and they weren't supposed to see it. But as the ducks danced, Iktomi killed them, one by one.\n\nThe moral of the story, Taken Alive explained, is that you shouldn't get caught dancing with your eyes closed.\n\n\"They gave us these sweet promises and 'We'll save your language and revitalize your language,' something so sacred to us, that my generation is thirsting for and the generations before us want to help us with,\" he said. \"We got caught dancing with our eyes closed.\"\n\nCORRECTION (June 3, 2022, 4:07 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the timing of when Wilhelm Meya donated copies of the Calico Winter Count translations to the University of Washington as source material to receive a grant. It was before Gloria Runs Close To Lodge-Goggles obtained a cease-and-desist order from the Oglala Lakota Tribal Court requiring Meya to return all the materials and copies of the winter count, not afterward.\n\nGraham Lee Brewer is a national reporter for NBC News.

The trial in the case, which shocked the country and renewed national debates about gun policies and race in America, was scheduled to begin on Oct. 7, 2024.\n\nSome supporters joined Yarl's mother in the courtroom, their T-shirts reading \"Ringing a doorbell is not a crime\" were turned inside out. Family friend Philip Barrolle said they wore the shirts that way Wednesday after being told by the court the shirts were a problem. Supporters have worn them in the past, but an order issued Monday barred \"outbreaks, signs, or displays of any kind.\"\n\n\"It is up to us to have our presence felt,\" Barrolle complained afterward.\n\nThe not guilty plea, entered by Lester's attorney, Steve Salmon, is largely a procedural step, and the hearing lasted just five minutes. Lester also pleaded not guilty soon after he was charged, but this is his first court appearance since a judge found sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial.\n\nSalmon said at the preliminary hearing that Lester was acting in self-defense , terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed for the night.\n\nYarl testified at the hearing that he was sent to pick up his twin siblings but had no phone - he'd lost it at school. The house he intended to go to was just blocks from his own home, but he had the street wrong.\n\nYarl testified that he rang the bell and the wait for someone to answer for what seemed \"longer than normal.\" As the inner door opened, Yarl said he reached out to grab the storm door, assuming his brother's friend's parents were there.\n\nInstead, it was Lester, who told him, \"Don't come here ever again,\" Yarl recalled. He said he was shot in the head, the impact knocking him to the ground, and was then shot in the arm.\n\nThe shot to his head left a bullet embedded in his skull, testified Dr. Jo Ling Goh, a pediatric neurosurgeon who treated Yarl. It did not penetrate his brain, however, and he was able to go back to high school. He is now a senior and is making plans to major in engineering in college.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Neighbors tell a different story.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThe fatal shooting of a Black man in a trailer park is rocking a rural community in Missouri as neighbors who say they witnessed the killing dispute the police narrative of events.\n\nJustin King, a 28-year-old Black and Filipino man, was shot Nov. 3 at 11:45 a.m. in the small town of Bourbon, located about 73 miles southwest of St. Louis.\n\nPolice say he was shot by the owner of a home he was trying to break into, but witnesses and family members say he was shot in \"cold blood\" by a man he called his friend.\n\nKing succumbed to his wounds at the scene. The 42-year-old white neighbor who shot him was taken into custody and later released.\n\nThe Crawford County Sheriff's Department said King was shot \"after forcing entry into a neighboring residence where an altercation took place.\" The homeowner \"feared for his life\" and shot King, the department said in a news release .\n\nThe department said evidence, video surveillance and statements \"preliminarily corroborate the homeowner's account of the events.\"\n\nBut family members of King and five people who live in the trailer park told NBC News they doubt that narrative.\n\nThree neighbors told NBC News the shooter was a man who had expressed a desire to kill someone, has a history of violence and was known to use racial epithets. Several neighbors said King and the shooter were friends.\n\nNimrod Chapel Jr., the president of the Missouri NAACP, who is representing the King family, said Justin King was shot outside the neighbor's home and had not entered it, contrary to the sheriff's account.\n\n\"The only person that says it's a home invasion is the guy that shot my son,\" King's father, John King, told NBC News. \"And all the neighbors are saying, 'No, you shot him in cold blood outside.'\"\n\n\"He had no shirt on, only pajama bottoms. So how was he a threat?\" John King said. \"Justin was shot in cold blood outside in broad daylight.\"\n\nUnder Missouri's \"castle doctrine\" law , individuals are allowed to use deadly force against intruders without the duty to retreat, based on the notion that their home is \"their castle.\"\n\nThe shooter, whose name has not been made public and who is not facing charges, did not reply to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nNeighbors described King as a happy-go-lucky man who always offered a helping hand. He had moved to Bourbon from St. Louis recently to be close to his 9-year-old daughter, Harlee.\n\nLesa Stiller, the manager of the trailer park, said she saw King outside heading toward the neighbor's trailer moments before the shooting. All of a sudden, she heard a \"pop, pop, pop.\"\n\n\"And right at that last pop, I saw Justin slowly stagger backwards real slow with his hands up in the air,\" near the outdoor front steps of the shooter's trailer, Stiller recalled. She noted that she didn't see King enter the trailer itself and that King and the shooter lived across from each other.\n\n\"I heard him say, 'I thought we were friends.' And [the neighbor] said, 'We were!' and he just slowly walked back,\" she said.\n\nAnother neighbor, Katie Bosek, described King as \"a gentle man who helped everybody.\" She said he helped her search for her dogs that went missing the same day as the shooting. Later that day, King and the neighbor who shot him worked together to fix her car, she said.\n\n\"They both got under the hood together. They're just cutting it up laughing as they're doing it,\" she said.\n\nShe claimed she saw King and the neighbor walk off together. She said she heard three gunshots about 15 minutes later and rushed to the window to see King lying on the ground.\n\nTrina Willson, who lives several trailers behind the shooter, said: \"He knew Justin. You would think that if your friend was coming into your house, you'd be like, 'Hey, man, what are you doing?' Why do you automatically resort to pulling out a gun and shooting him? How can this even possibly go down as self-defense?\"\n\nChapel noted that the neighbor and King had cameras at their homes. Police have not released any video footage from the incident to the public or the family but said they have \"viewed all videos at our disposal.\" The Crawford County Sheriff's Department said it intends to share the footage \"upon the final case review by the county prosecutor.\"\n\nKing's death has torn apart the close-knit community in the small town of Bourbon, home to 1,600 residents.\n\n\"It's been crazy here since that. We've never had nothing like that in this little small town since I've been here in 20 years,\" Earl McCoy, another neighbor, said. \"We take care of each other in here. It's been eerily quiet here. It was like a ghost town.\"\n\nThree people who live in the park said the neighbor who shot King had threatened violence before.\n\nStiller said the neighbor was known to show off his gun - including once at a party she threw on Oct. 30.\n\n\"He never went anywhere without that .32 in his belt,\" she said.\n\nBosek recalled that King told her months before the shooting that the neighbor had threatened to shoot him.\n\n\"Justin came over about two months prior to all this happening. He was like, 'You know he threatened to shoot me? Yeah, that dude threatened to shoot me,'\" she said. \"Justin was such a good guy. He would always forgive people and keep going back.\"\n\nMcCoy said the shooter \"had guns all over his house.\"\n\n\"The last time I talked to [the neighbor] was at a party on Halloween when he showed everybody his little pistol,\" McCoy said. \"He said, 'I don't fight no more; I shoot motherf------.'\"\n\nKing's father believes the shooting was an act of \"racially motivated hate\" and said his son was the only Black person in that trailer community.\n\nTwo neighbors also said the shooter was known to use racial slurs.\n\n\"He was always open with the N-word. He never said 'Black man,'\" Stiller said.\n\n\"He would blurt [racial epithets] out. He wouldn't call it to Justin if he was standing around me and Justin because he knows I'd knock his a-- off,\" McCoy said.\n\nThe neighbor who shot King has a criminal record involving violence. He was arrested in June 2017 and charged with second-degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon while intoxicated, both felonies, according to court records.\n\nCourt records do not show if those charges were dismissed. The Crawford County court clerk declined to comment, and the Crawford County prosecutor's office did not respond to NBC News' request for comment on those charges.\n\nFederal law generally prohibits people from possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony, according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence . Further, Missouri also prohibits possession of a firearm by any person convicted of a felony under Missouri law.\n\nJohn King said he was outraged to see sheriff's deputies escorting the shooter back to his trailer the day after his son's death.\n\nThe family, along with local activists, are calling out the sheriff's department and demanding a thorough investigation.\n\n\"I feel, like, betrayed by all the police,\" King's mother, Eva Bruns, said. \"They're not being fair. I don't know if it's because of color or because of the way the killer is.\"\n\n\"In the investigation, nothing has been done,\" she said. \"Twenty-four hours later and he's out of jail. I don't know what kind of justice that is.\"\n\nCrawford County Sheriff Darin Layman said in a statement that all the information shared thus far in the case is \"accurate in relation to our investigation and findings.\"\n\n\"Our office has not uncovered any evidence to support the idea that this was a racially motivated incident,\" he said. \"We have contacted the FBI regarding this investigation and requested their assistance in processing a portion of the evidence collected.\"\n\nThe FBI in Missouri declined to comment on the case.\n\nNow the family is focusing on getting answers on what happened in the build-up to King's death.\n\n\"The family wants to make sure that whoever is responsible for the death of their son is held accountable,\" Chapel, the King family's lawyer, said. \"But right now we just settle for the disclosure of the truth.\"\n\nSo far, no lawsuit has been filed in the case, but Chapel said, \"I wouldn't rule anything out at this point.\"\n\nChapel said the lack of action in King's case is part of a statewide problem when it comes to investigating the deaths of African Americans, pointing to the cases of Tory Sanders and Derontae Martin.\n\nSanders, 28, a Black inmate at a rural jail, died in May 2017 under similar circumstances to George Floyd, after a white law enforcement officer pressed his knee on his neck, according to a wrongful death suit filed by his family. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt declined to file charges in his death.\n\nMartin, 19, was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head on April 25 at the home of a white man who had posted racist memes on social media. Authorities concluded that he died by suicide, but in July, a jury of six people ruled during a coroner's inquest hearing that Martin was killed by violence .\n\n\"That's Jim Crow justice,\" Chapel said. \"This is a statewide issue. In Justin's case, they allege that there's an investigation, but then they produce the results of the investigation before the investigation is complete. What kind of police work is that?\"\n\nMissouri's NAACP chapter issued a travel advisory in 2017 that remains in effect today warning people to travel with caution in the state because \"race, gender and color-based crimes have a long history in Missouri.\"\n\n\"What Missouri needs is to have some federal oversight to ensure that law enforcement is trying to treat people in the way that the Constitution demands, whether you're the alleged perpetrator of a crime or victim of a crime - that you have the same rights regardless of skin color,\" Chapel said.\n\nOn Nov. 16, the Crawford County Sheriff's Department said the investigation into King's death is still open and evidence is being processed and sent off for lab analysis. The department also said an informal case review was conducted with the Crawford County prosecutor's office, and there will be follow-ups with witnesses and evidence collection.\n\nMarlene Lenthang is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He was facing up to seven years in jail after reaching a plea deal and was awaiting sentencing March 7.\n\n\"While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr. Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case,\" Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson said in a statement. \"Our thoughts remain with both families affected by this tragic incident as they continue their healing process.\"\n\nYarl's family members said in a statement that Lester never apologized for what he did and that \"instead, he and his attorney used every legal maneuver possible to delay accountability.\"\n\n\"Now, another Black child harmed by prejudice will never see the man who shot him face the full weight of the justice system,\" his family said, adding, \"Ralph Yarl survived, yet justice was never truly served. He has a lifetime ahead to carry the trauma of that night, while the man responsible escaped sentencing.\"\n\nLester had pleaded guilty to one felony count of second-degree assault.\n\nLast week, after the plea agreement was reached, Yarl's mother, Cleo Nagbe,said she was frustrated that Lester's case had been  delayed for several months.\n\n\"Why did we allow him to live in his house comfortably, do all the things that he desired to do?\" she told NBC News.\n\nThe family also expressed frustration with the deal itself, saying it does not erase the trauma that they and Yarl endured, nor does it address perceived failures in the justice system, including racial bias.\n\n\"While this marks a step toward accountability, true justice requires consequences that reflect the severity of his actions - anything less would be a failure to recognize the harm,\" the family said in a statement. \"This case has never been just about Ralph - it is about every child's right to exist without being seen as a threat.\"\n\nThompson responded that the outcome \"ensures accountability for the defendant, provides closure to Mr. Yarl, and satisfies the need to achieve a just result in the case.\"\n\nLester's trial had been scheduled to start Tuesday in Kansas City, Missouri. He had pleaded not guilty to one felony count each of first-degree assault and armed criminal action.\n\nBefore the plea deal was made, members of Yarl's family said they had little trust in the Clay County Prosecuting Attorney's Office because they believe it had not worked aggressively enough for a conviction, said the family's spokesperson, Faith Spoonmore, Yarl's aunt.\n\nAs an example, she said, Thompson did not argue in the charging documents that race was a factor in the shooting.\n\n\"I don't think that the prosecutor's office is on our side,\" Spoonmore said before the deal was announced.\n\nThompson responded Friday, saying, \"We understand their frustration, but throughout this process our office has maintained regular and respectful communication with Mr. Yarl's family. They were consulted during the process.\"\n\nRace was a component in the case, but there was no evidence of racial motivation, Thompson said, adding he explored all aspects of the case.\n\nLester, who was initially charged with a felony count of first-degree assault and armed criminal action, shot Yarl with a handgun on April 13, 2023, when Yarl rang Lester's doorbell, mistaking it for the house where he was supposed to pick up his siblings.\n\nLester fired multiple shots, grazing Yarl in the head and striking him in the arm. Lester immediately called police, telling them he fired his gun because he was scared.\n\nYarl, 18, who is in his first semester of college at Texas A&M, declined to comment this week, He told NBC News last year in his first in-depth interview about how the shooting affected him that it had been \"a bumpy journey.\"\n\n\"Whenever there's something that goes on that reminds me of what happened ... I just have, like, such a negative wave of emotions, like anger, like disgust,\" he said. \"It's always a mix of good and bad days. And I feel like the good days are when I'm able to be around people that help me build myself up.\"\n\nDeon J.

After walking inside, he followed a Black man who was shopping with his grandson.\n\nProsecutors said Bush shot the man, Maurice Stallard, 69, in the back of the head and then shot him several more times in the torso, killing him. Bush then re-holstered his gun and \"calmly walked out the store,\" according to the press release.\n\nIn the parking lot, Bush walked up to Vickie Lee Jones, 67, and shot her several times in the head and body. Jones, a Black woman, died at the scene.\n\nFederal prosecutors said that Bush did not know the two victims and chose to shoot them because of their race.\n\nSeconds after Jones was killed, a Black man approached Bush and asked what was going on. Without responding, Bush walked toward the man with his gun drawn. The man, who was in lawful possession of a handgun, fired at Bush.\n\nProsecutors said that Bush shot at the man and then walked away. Authorities previously said that the man, identified by local media outlets as Dominiic Rozier, was not struck.\n\n\"Bush had no prior relationship with the third victim and chose to shoot at him because of his race,\" the DOJ said.\n\nRozier told NBC affiliate WAVE in an October 2018 interview that he fired at Bush to protect his wife.\n\n\"I could have died,\" he said. \"She could have died. A lot more people could have died.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, a white man, who was legally armed, also encountered Bush in the store's parking lot. Bush told that man not to shoot him and said that \" whites don't shoot whites ,\" the press release states.\n\n\"Today's guilty plea will ensure that a violent and disturbed man will never get another chance to target and terrorize the Black community,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela S. Karlan said in a statement.\n\n\"It won't bring back two pillars of the Louisville community, whose tragic and senseless deaths we mourn, but we hope it sends the message that the Justice Department will work tirelessly to bring perpetrators of bias-motivated violence to justice.\"\n\nJeffersontown police had previously said that Bush tried to enter the First Baptist Church of Jeffersontown about 15 minutes before the shootings at Kroger. He could not get into the predominately Black church because the doors were locked.\n\nAuthorities said they could not confirm if Bush was armed at the time he tried to get inside the church.\n\nBush faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court on June 24, 2021.\n\nHe is already serving a life sentence in state prison after pleading guilty but mentally ill to local charges of murder, attempted murder, and wanton endangerment . His attorney could not be reached on Friday.\n\nMinyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

We were confused.\"\n\nAfter the man approached the students a second time, Butterfield decided to start recording.\n\n\"In Tallahassee, there's a lot of people with their own racial opinions,\" said Butterfield. \"It doesn't sound like a place where people of color are invited or welcomed.\"\n\nThese are the kind of people that are burning Nike products , we are sick of the discrimination  never thought I'd have a personal experience with racism like this, this man pulled a gun on us because we were walking up to my friends apartment w/o a key pic.twitter.com/TlMFQjoM1N\n\nThe video posted on Butterfield's Twitter account begins with a shirtless white man, who Butterfield and his friends identified as \"Chad,\" confronting the man on behalf of the students. The two have an altercation, with Chad asking the man: \"What's your problem? You're not just man enough to go about your day?\"\n\n\"We literally met Chad that night. We didn't really know Chad like that,\" Butterfield said. \"He was there and heard what was going on, and he stepped up. I commend him for that.\"\n\nInside the building, the man tells the students to find another elevator, declaring to them, \"this is my elevator.\" As the altercation escalates, the man pulls out his gun and keeps it by his side.\n\n\"He made sure that we saw the gun,\" said Butterfield. \"He was holding his arm in a way to emphasize.\"\n\nOne of the students, Fitzroy Rhoden, is heard in the video asking the man: \"Sir, you bring out your gun. What's your purpose for that?\" The man then apologizes and puts the gun in his back pocket.\n\nDespite the weapon being out, Butterfield wasn't concerned that the man would shoot at them, saying he thought it was more of a \"if you make me use it, I'm going to use it\" kind of threat.\n\nThe students began to ask the older man if he is a resident of the building, considering the apartments were predominately rented by college students.\n\n\"My friend asked him, 'Do you even live here, where's your key?'\" said Butterfield. The video then shows the man respond, pulling out keys and a gun.\n\nIn an email shared by Butterfield, Stadium Centre management addressed the situation, stating: \"We are cooperating with the police during their investigation and it has been determined that the person in the elevator is not a resident. Firearms are prohibited on our property and we take this matter very seriously.\"\n\nTallahassee police spokesman, Damon Miller Jr., told NBC News the department is still conducting interviews as part of the investigation.\n\nMany on social media are identifying the man in the video as the general manager of Baymont Inn & Suites Tallahassee Central. On Tuesday, Baymont Tallahassee released a statement on their Instagram account confirming they were aware of the situation and that the general manager has since been fired.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bnj56ounprc\n\nThe man identified in reports did not respond to request for comment from NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nAfter the incident, Butterfield says he felt embarrassed and singled out by the man, but recognizes the altercation as being bigger than a local issue.\n\n\"There are people out here targeting young black males to retaliate in a violent way just so they can retaliate also and use deadly force and be protected by the law due to Stand Your Ground,\" said Butterfield. \"And that's a setup.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "âThe most exciting group of white menâ: Sizing up the Kamala Harris veepstakes\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has to pick a potential vice president of her own âÂ and fast. Democrats plan to confirm her nomination and her running mate at a âvirtual roll callâ on August 7, ahead of their convention.\n\nSo far, the shortlist of most-discussed names has hinged on a specific type of politician, with figures like Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz all drawing significant attention.\n\nâThis is the most exciting group of white men I have ever seen,â Caitlin Legacki, a Democratic strategist and former Biden administration official, said.\n\nThere are other reported names floating around as well, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Plus the more out-of-the-box options: Retired Admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, took himself out of the running on Wednesday. And Democrats keep whispering to us about businessman Mark Cuban, even as heâs shown no public interest in the job.\n\nBut both Republicans and Democrats still think Harris is most likely to go with one of the initial names, almost all of whom have a reputation for staying in the partyâs center on policy and speaking to swing voters outside their base. One Republican strategist said the specific choice might matter less than that a relative moderate would require a âsmall strategy shiftâ on their end to tie Harris to her past left-leaning positions.\n\nHereâs a quick rundown of the major players, their perceived strengths and weaknesses, and why they might end up on the ticket.\n\nIn this article:\n\nJosh Shapiro\n\nWhy he might get it. Shapiro seems to be the one the opposition is most worried about, which seems like a point in his favor. âIf Republicans donât win Pennsylvania, itâs a way tougher slog,â one well-connected Republican said. âGotta basically sweep everywhere else.â Heâs a popular and charismatic 51-year-old governor in arguably the most important swing state who has accused Trump of â shit talking America .â His most famous accomplishment is nonpartisan: Rapidly fixing a section of the I-95 highway after it collapsed . Shapiro also was widely praised in both parties for his unifying words after a shooter targeted a Trump rally in his state. He has touted an â all of the above â energy approach in a state where natural gas is a major industry, which could help rebut early attacks on Harris for once opposing fracking (she walked it back upon joining the Biden ticket). And, like Harris, heâs a former state attorney general.\n\nWhy he might not. Shapiro is strong in part because heâs seen as a pragmatist who isnât afraid to anger the left-leaning interest groups when it suits him. But that means picking him could also anger left-leaning interest groups. Heâs broken with the party to support school vouchers, angering teachers unions, although it didnât make it into the most recent budget . Then thereâs Israel: Like many Democrats, Shapiro has struck a balance between asserting Israelâs right to defend itself, condemning the Netanyahu government, and arguing for a two-state solution. But Shapiro, who is Jewish, has also strongly condemned antisemitism on the left and upset activists opposed to the Gaza operation by comparing some campus protests to the KKK. His administration also settled a sexual harassment claim against a then-senior adviser, a piece of baggage that Harris might not want to carry as she takes aim at Trumpâs alleged sexual indiscretion.\n\nMark Kelly\n\nWhy he might get it. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly has a background that many Democrats are excited about: Heâs a former NASA astronaut who served as a US Navy combat pilot, and heâs been vocal about securing the border, which could help combat one of Republicansâ big attack lines against Harris. Heâs perhaps best known as a forceful advocate for gun safety laws ever since his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was badly wounded in a shooting at a district event. Arizona leaned red before Kelly won a seat in 2020, and heâs widely seen as more moderate than others in his party. David Axelrod, during a discussion with The Cook Political Report publisher Amy Walter this week , described Kelly as âan alpha guyâ â and both noted that this could be a plus against a Republican Party that stocked its recent convention with macho speakers like Hulk Hogan and Dana White to appeal to men.\n\nWhy he might not. Kelly may be more valuable to Democrats in the Senate. If Harris wins with him on the ticket, the Democratic governor would appoint a replacement and trigger a special election in 2026, which could make it harder for the party to secure a majority. Kelly also hasnât signed onto the PRO Act, which would make it easier to organize unions, and thatâs raised red flags for labor groups otherwise eager to back Harris. (Kelly said Wednesday that he would vote for the legislation if it hit the Senate floor, potentially removing this obstacle).\n\nTim Walz\n\nWhy he might get it. Walz is a known figure with major credibility in the party, particularly among House Democrats, given his long tenure in the lower chamber from 2007 to 2019. âHe can take the fight, and we all know him,â Rep. Ann Kuster, chair of the New Democrat Coalition, told Semafor, adding thatâs who âpopped outâ for her in a âtalentedâ field of possible VP picks. Democrats also argue Walzâs past military service, teaching career, and Midwestern background would appeal to swing voters in must-win states. âHe would be a great choice,â Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Thursday. With slim legislative majorities in Minnesota, Walz signed into law an expansion of labor rights, and a measure providing universal free lunches, among other sweeping progressive reforms . Walz has also been a blunt attack-dog in interviews and called Republicans âweirdâ for seeking to curb reproductive rights and implement book bans.\n\nWhy he might not. While Walz is well-liked in Congress, he hasnât attracted as much national media attention in the Biden era as the other governors on this list. He also doesnât hail from a must-win state for Democrats, as MinnesotaÂ last swung Republican for President Richard Nixon in 1972. Things look more competitive this cycle, but if the party is losing in Minnesota, they likely are losing the election already by a wide margin. In addition, Republicans are attacking Harris as an out-of-touch progressive, and itâs possible Harris shies away from someone who has accumulated a liberal governing record in favor of a more overtly moderate figure that balances out the Democratic ticket.\n\nRoy Cooper\n\nWhy he might get it. Gov. Cooper of North Carolina and Harris have known each other for years from their time as attorneys general and at least one operative suggested familiarity could be a factor in Harrisâ choice. Heâs term-limited this year after spending the last seven years as a buffer between the stateâs deep red legislature and its relatively purple electorate. One of his big achievements was getting bipartisan support to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, an issue Democrats would be happy to press Trump on. Strategists also think Cooper could be an asset on the reproductive rights front by telling his story of combatting Republican efforts to restrict abortion âÂ the legislature enacted a 12-week ban he had previously vetoed only after a safe-seat Democrat switched parties.\n\nWhy he might not . Democrats donât want Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who is known for his wildly inflammatory politics even by recent standards, to take over as the acting governor whenever Cooper leaves the state to campaign. Heâs also the oldest name on this list at age 67, and Democrats might be reluctant after their recent experience with Biden to elevate someone who could potentially be a presidential candidate in their 70s later on.\n\nAndy Beshear\n\nWhy he might get it. Heâs the fresh-faced 46-year-old governor of one of the reddest states in the country and won an impressive re-election against a longtime Mitch McConnell protege, Daniel Cameron, in 2023. Democrats were especially impressed with how he did it, too: He ran hard on protecting abortion rights (this ad was one of the most memorable of the cycle) and vetoed a bill that would have restricted access to care for transgender youth. Within the state, he also boosted his popularity in rural counties by managing the response to a major flood . Heâs currently trying to position himself as a counter to JD Vance, who he says has portrayed Appalachians in Kentucky as stereotypically âlazy.â\n\nWhy he might not. There is no universe in which Harris is competing in Kentucky, so Beshear doesnât bring much state-specific utility. Some Democrats also question how well his profile translates outside of Kentucky, where he benefits from a unique political brand as the son of a popular former governor, Steve Beshear.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nWhy he might get it. Heâs an Afghanistan veteran and small-town mayor who already ran a strong presidential campaign and is widely seen as one of the partyâs greatest communicators. Democrats have long been impressed with his ability to carry the White Houseâs message on conservative outlets like Fox News. Recently, he criticized Vance for deriding â childless cat ladies â in 2021, a list on which he included Buttigieg, who has since adopted two children with his husband, Chasten. His portfolio as Transportation Secretary has included infrastructure projects and new rules requiring airlines to reimburse customers for canceled flights, two topics that allies think would play well on the campaign trail. In general, Harris could trust him to defend their administrationâs record with no additional training necessary. Democrats also see him as a potential fundraising juggernaut âÂ some operatives predict heâd raise another $100 million for the campaign easily.\n\nWhy he might not. Indiana, where Buttiegieg served as mayor of South Bend, is a Republican stronghold and not a battleground state. Heâs most popular nationally with the kind of college-educated voters who Democrats have performed especially well with in the Trump era, but some Democrats are skeptical as to whether he helps the party enough elsewhere. His own presidential campaign was hindered by a lack of Black and Latino support, two groups that Democrats are especially worried about retaining support and turnout from this cycle.\n\nThe field\n\nRace and gender is obviously front and center in this discussion and thereâs a (sometimes explicit, sometimes whispered) notion in political conversations that Harris needs a white man to balance the ticket. But not everyone agrees with that assumption: Whitmer has many fans in the party and governs a critical swing state in Michigan, though sheâs said sheâs not interested in the job. Columnist James E. Causey argues Moore âÂ widely seen as a potential 2028 contender if Trump wins â should get the nod , pointing to his management of a bridge collapse in Maryland and pardons for marijuana offenders.\n\nThere are also some other names on the outer edges of the white male governor category. Pritzker has a following, but is in a deep blue state that might make him less helpful in balancing the ticket. And Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, another dark horse name, poked fun at the demographic conversations around the ticket in a recent CNN interview: âLook, if they do the polling and it turns out they need a 49-year-old balding gay Jew from Boulder, Colorado, theyâve got my number.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nHarris has narrowed the gap against Trump, a new New York Time/Siena poll found. Theyâre effectively tied 48-47 among likely voters, with both getting a big bump in their personal popularity from the last few weeks of news.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Why is Jamaal Bowman so angry?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nEarlier this month, Rep. Jamaal Bowman walked outside of the House chamber and barked at reporters with an assignment: Ask Republicans âwhy the hell you wonât do anything to save Americaâs children.â\n\nHe was loud. He was frustrated. And he was in his element.\n\nThe scene ended in a viral confrontation over gun violence between Bowman and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. âCalm down?â he yelled at the Republican member. âChildren are dying!â\n\nIt was only one of several recent confrontational moments that seemed designed to set the internet on fire. There was a robust debate on the steps of the Capitol with Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. over the GOPâs 2024 candidates, which they reprised on CNN on Wednesday night (with clips traveling far and wide online ). Earlier this month in Lower Manhattan, Bowman shouted to reporters that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. âneeds to take her ass back to Washington and do something about gun violenceâ while countering her rally protesting Donald Trumpâs indictment.\n\nBut as Bowman recounted the scene outside of the House chambers with Massie, he focused on someone else.\n\nâThen I saw Hakeem â this is hilarious â like, walk past and kind of just bounce,â he told Semafor, referring to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The implication: The more reserved and cautious Jeffries didnât want anything to do with a high-octane spectacle he might have to comment on.\n\nBowmanâs a former New York City school principal who ran as an outsider in 2020 against the local political machine (Jeffries endorsed his opponent, former House Foreign Affairs chair Eliot Engel) and unseated a longstanding incumbent. He kept a lower profile in his first term, where daily business was disrupted by the pandemic, which claimed the life of his mother, and the House was still reeling from the Capitol riots.\n\nThis year, however, heâs found his niche as an unapologetically brash, openly defiant politician who uses his platform to rally activists. Nor has he been afraid to stand out on policy: He was one of the few members to defend TikTok while it came under fire from just about every corner of politics.\n\nIn doing so, Bowman says heâs reminding Americans âBlack men are not a monolithâ and that thereâs more ways to get out their message than President Obamaâs more placid approach, which Jeffries has followed.\n\nHe illustrated the contrast by comparing hip hop artists: â Hakeem is more like Jay-Z and I guess Iâm more like Busta Rhymes,â he said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nBowmanâs in-your-face persona challenges one of the biggest taboos in politics: The âangry Black manâ stereotype. Black politicians often worry that a wrong move will overshadow their real grievances, even if white leaders donât face the same constraints.\n\nEspecially among Black leaders with ambitions beyond representing a minority-majority district, politicians tend to follow the footsteps of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. over Malcolm X. The comic duo Key and Peele satirized the famously calm and deliberate Barack Obama with an âanger translatorâ who said all the things that a Black president palatable to white voters could never get away with saying. Keegan-Michael Key ended up performing the act live with Obama himself at the 2015 White House Correspondents Associationâs dinner.\n\nBowman, for his part, is not worried about falling prey to the âangry Black manâ stereotype.\n\nâNah, those days are over,â he said. âThose days are finished. One of the reasons why that video went so viral [is] because Americaâs never seen a Black man yelling at a white man like that.â\n\nThe political landscape has evolved in some ways. Black candidates winning in majority-white cities, states, and districts has become more common in recent years, while white Democrats have moved left on racial issues in ways that may make them more receptive to different styles.\n\nBowman says he favors the rabble rousing approach over the more conciliatory one favored by Jeffries because itâs sometimes needed to draw attention to issues that lawmakers would prefer to ignore.\n\nâIâm yelling because 9-year olds were slaughtered by assault rifles,â he told Semafor. âLike, thatâs why Iâm yelling. Iâm not yelling just to be loud.â\n\nBowman entered the education system on the heels of the Columbine High School massacre. And then the mass shooting at Virginia Tech happened several years later, followed by the Sandy Hook Elementary High School shooting. The year before he ran for office, 34 students within the K-12 system in his district died â17 of them by suicide.\n\nâOne of the murders happened right up the street at New Rochelle High School from the Bronx and no one was talking about it,â he said. âNo elected official, no elected leader was sounding the alarm on children dying. And so thatâs why I ran, because Iâm like, yo, the children dying are the result of something like housing, foster care system, trauma, addiction, criminal justice, but all that connects to policy and we got policymakers silent. So when Iâm yelling, itâs about that.â\n\nAl Sharpton, who last year was the subject of a documentary called âLoudmouth,â told Semafor heâs always defended a more confrontational approach as a complement to politicians with a broader base of support.\n\nIt was part of a long-running argument he had with the late David Dinkins, who was elected the first Black mayor of New York City in 1989 and served during a period of heightened racial tension.\n\nSharpton recalled that Dinkins would often say to him, âAl, you donât have to be that vibrant.â\n\nâI said, âYes, I do. Because you donât understand: The more I put down heat, the more it drives them to you to make a compromise,ââ Sharpton said.\n\nDavid Axelrod, who helped plan Obamaâs political path from Chicago to the White House, honed his craft working to elect Harold Washington, the cityâs first Black mayor . Heâs known for his work helping minority candidates sell their message to voters who may not be used to seeing nonwhite politicians on the ballot.\n\nâIâve worked with Black mayors all over the country, Iâve worked with Deval Patrick when he ran for governor of Massachusetts,â Axelrod said. âObviously, thatâs over the span of three decades so things change and evolve.â\n\nAxelrod saw Bowmanâs hallway outburst against Massie as an educator ârighteously indignant about what was happening to our kids.â But he also warned that approach could diminish the message.\n\nâThe sentiment that he was expressing is one that a lot of people share, but does that get lost? Does the form overtake the content?â Axelrod said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Principals\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. is angry about gun violence and regularly going viral online telling Republicans exactly how he feels about it. Kadia Goba visited his Bronx district to hear more about his confrontational approach and talk about the complicated politics of Black politicians expressing outrage.\n\nWeâre all on Biden campaign announcement watch this week, as rumors swirl the president could announce he wants a second term as soon as tomorrow. In the meantime, the Republicans have the field to themselves and spent the weekend courting evangelical voters in Iowa at a time when the party is still trying to figure out its position on abortion with Roe v. Wade gone. David Weigel and Shelby Talcott have the latest.\n\nPlus, Morgan Chalfant gets One Good Text from Global Situation Room president Brett Bruen on the evacuation of U.S. embassy personnel from Sudan, which is sliding towards civil war.\n\nWas this email forwarded to you? Sign up here!\n\nâ White House: The president is expected to soon officially launch his reelection campaign and plans to name one of his senior White House advisers, Julie Chavez Rodriguez , to manage the operation, according to CBS News. Today, Biden will meet with three Tennessee state lawmakers who faced expulsion votes for leading a gun control demonstration on the House floor.\n\nâ Senate: Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will bring up his resolution condemning former President Trumpâs call to defund the Justice Department and FBI as soon as Tuesday, according to his office.\n\nâ House: McCarthy said the House still plans to vote on the GOP debt ceiling plan this week and expressed optimism it will pass despite a number of holdouts. âWe do have a very small majority,â McCarthy said on Fox News. âBut I cannot imagine someone in our conference that would want to go along with Bidenâs reckless spending.â Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrapped up a visit to Ghana, his first congressional delegation as the House Democratic leader.\n\nThe U.S. military evacuated all American embassy personnel from Sudan and the State Department suspended operations at the embassy in Khartoum over the weekend amid ongoing violence in the country. Over 100 Special Operations forces assisted the mission, officials said. Other countries like France and Germany have subsequently evacuated their personnel. There arenât currently plans for a coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens from Sudan, but Under Secretary of State for Management John Bass said over the weekend the U.S. is in âclose touchâ with Americans in the country to help them assess the security situation.\n\nThe abortion drug mifepristone will stay on the market while legal challenges to its FDA approval play out, thanks to the Supreme Courtâs order on Friday staying lower courts court rulings that would have cut off or limited access to the pills . In the meantime, the issue is dividing the Republican Party. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is considering a presidential run, told CBS News he would like to see the pill âoff the market to protect the unborn.â Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who identifies herself as pro-life, told ABC News the Supreme Court made the â right decision .â She also urged Republicans to âfind some middle groundâ and avoid âextremities.â\n\nNever Back Down, the super PAC boosting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, briefed Shelby Talcott on their plan to re-introduce him to primary voters with a new ad campaign highlighting his âblue collar rootsâ and military service. âHis name I.D. is really high â heâs right there with Trump,â Erin Perrine, communications director at Never Back Down, said. âBut what we have found is that people donât really know his story.â The group is also bringing on former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt as its chair, who is a longtime DeSantis confidant. The two were roommates at Navy officer training and DeSantis stumped for Laxalt in his 2022 Senate run.\n\nSpeaking of DeSantis : He might be struggling in the primary polls lately, but at least heâs big in Japan . The likely 2024 hopeful headed to Tokyo for the first stop on a multi-country foreign trip, where he talked with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for roughly 40 minutes , discussing issues like China and North Korea.\n\nSeventy percent of Americans say that Biden should not run for president in 2024, while 60% say the same of former President Trump , according to a new NBC News poll . Despite those misgivings, the 2024 race still looks likelier than ever to be a rematch between the current president and the former president: Trump has a significant lead in the same NBC poll, while Biden faces only token primary opposition .\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nPunchbowl News: McCarthy was worried about Americans for Tax Reform potentially opposing a plan to repeal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits as part of their debt ceiling bill and phoned the groupâs president, Grover Norquist. Punchbowl got a statement from the anti-tax group supporting the repeal of the tax credits.\n\nPlaybook: Politico has a guide to getting into the best White House Correspondentsâ Association dinner parties (Steve even makes a cameo).\n\nThe Early 202: Biden still faces a challenge with young voters , but his favorability rating among the key group is higher than it is for congressional Republicans.\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nEarlier this month, Rep. Jamaal Bowman walked outside of the House chamber and barked at reporters with an assignment: Ask Republicans âwhy the hell you wonât do anything to save Americaâs children.â\n\nHe was loud. He was frustrated. And he was in his element.\n\nThe scene ended in a viral confrontation over gun violence between Bowman and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. âCalm down?â he yelled at the Republican member. âChildren are dying!â\n\nIt was only one of several recent confrontational moments that seemed designed to set the internet on fire. There was a robust debate on the steps of the Capitol with Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. over the GOPâs 2024 candidates, which they reprised on CNN . Earlier this month in Lower Manhattan, Bowman shouted to reporters that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. âneeds to take her ass back to Washington and do something about gun violenceâ next to her rally protesting Donald Trumpâs indictment.\n\nBut as Bowman recounted the scene outside of the House chambers with Massie, he focused on someone else.\n\nâThen I saw Hakeem â this is hilarious â like, walk past and kind of just bounce,â he told Semafor, referring to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe implication: The more reserved and cautious Jeffries didnât want anything to do with a high-octane spectacle he might have to comment on.\n\nBowmanâs a former New York City school principal who ran and won as an outsider in 2020 against the local political machine (Jeffries endorsed his opponent, the longtime House Foreign Affairs chair Eliot Engel). He kept a lower profile in his first term, where daily business was disrupted by the pandemic, which also claimed his mother, and the House was still reeling from the Capitol riots.\n\nThis year, however, heâs found his niche as an unapologetically brash politician who uses his platform to rally activists with conflict. In doing so, Bowman says heâs reminding Americans âBlack men are not a monolithâ and that thereâs more ways to get out their message than President Obamaâs more placid approach, which Jeffries has followed.\n\nHe illustrated the contrast by comparing hip hop artists: â Hakeem is more like Jay-Z and I guess Iâm more like Busta Rhymes,â he said.\n\nKADIAâS VIEW\n\nBowmanâs in-your-face persona challenges one of the biggest taboos in politics: The âangry Black manâ stereotype. Black politicians often worry that a wrong move will overshadow their real grievances, even if white leaders donât face the same constraints.\n\nEspecially among Black leaders with ambitions beyond representing a minority-majority district, politicians tend to follow the footsteps of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. over Malcolm X. The comic duo Key and Peele satirized the famously calm and deliberate Barack Obama with an âanger translatorâ who said all the things that a Black president palatable to white voters could never get away with saying. Keegan-Michael Key ended up performing the act live with Obama himself at the 2015 White House Correspondents Associationâs dinner.\n\nBowman, for his part, is not worried about falling prey to the âangry Black manâ stereotype.\n\nâNah, those days are over,â he said. âThose days are finished. One of the reasons why that video went so viral [is] because Americaâs never seen a Black man yelling at a white man like that.â\n\nBowman says he favors the rabble rousing approach over the more conciliatory one favored by Jeffries because itâs sometimes needed to draw attention to issues that lawmakers would prefer to ignore.\n\nâIâm yelling because 9-year olds were slaughtered by assault rifles,â he told Semafor. âLike, thatâs why Iâm yelling. Iâm not yelling just to be loud.â\n\nBowman entered the education system on the heels of the Columbine High School massacre. Many similar shootings followed. The year before he ran for office, 34 students within the K-12 system in his district died â17 of them by suicide.\n\nâOne of the murders happened right up the street at New Rochelle High School from the Bronx and no one was talking about it,â he said. âNo elected official, no elected leader was sounding the alarm on children dying.â\n\nTHE VIEW FROM AL SHARPTON\n\nAl Sharpton, who last year was the subject of a documentary called âLoudmouth,â told Semafor heâs always defended a more confrontational approach as a complement to politicians with a broader base of support. It was part of a long-running argument he had with the late David Dinkins, who was elected the first Black mayor of New York City in 1989.\n\nSharpton recalled that Dinkins would often say to him, âAl, you donât have to be that vibrant.â\n\nâI said, âYes, I do. Because you donât understand: The more I put down heat, the more it drives them to you to make a compromise,ââ Sharpton said.\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nDavid Axelrod, who helped plan Obamaâs political path from Chicago to the White House, is known for his work helping minority candidates sell their message to a broader electorate.\n\nWhile Axelrod saw Bowmanâs hallway outburst against Massie as an educator ârighteously indignant about what was happening to our kids,â he also warned that approach could diminish the message.\n\nâThe sentiment that he was expressing is one that a lot of people share, but does that get lost? Does the form overtake the content?â Axelrod said.\n\nCLIVE, Iowa â Mike Pence broke with Donald Trump on abortion rights, endorsing federal limits on the practice after his former running mateâs campaign said it would leave the issue to the states. But there was not much GOP-on-GOP conflict here on Saturday, when Pence and seven other White House-curious Republicans spoke to a thousand social conservatives, fed by Chick-fil-a.\n\nâReturning the question of life to the states and the American people did not mean that itâs a states-only issue,â Pence told reporters in a gaggle after a âfireside chatâ with a Republican womenâs group, before heading to the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalitionâs spring meeting.\n\nAll in all, what was left unsaid was perhaps more notable than what was: While some candidates dipped their toe into the abortion debate, the topic overall was not close to being a main subject at an event focused in part on faith.\n\nThe gathering was less cattle call, more open mic night. Pence, who like Trump highlighted his administrationâs appointment of conservative justices during his remarks to the group, shared the large evening stage with Republicans unfamiliar to most primary voters â from Trump-critical ex-Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to Michigan businessman Perry Johnson to conservative pundit Larry Elder in his first campaign appearance as a candidate.\n\nâEvery single one of them had a moment,â Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann told Semafor. âEither an answer to a question, or their presentation, struck a nerve.â\n\nThe 2024 hopefuls spent most of their time introducing themselves to the crowd, and many sought to explain why their own life stories proved the greatness of America. Noticeably absent from the event was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was busy speaking to Republicans in Utah, and Nikki Haley, who was off the campaign trail that day. Donald Trump appeared, Oz-like, via a recorded video, calling the end of Roe v. Wade âa landmark victory for protecting innocent life.â\n\nTrump also lauded his anti-abortion wins as president, describing himself as âthe most pro-life president in American history.â He didnât directly address his campaignâs recent stance, but his speech focused more on the issue than some other candidates. More broadly, the former president also offered more concrete policy plans, talking about overhauling the FBI, cutting federal funding for schools pushing Critical Race Theory, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Tim Scott (who raised eyebrows by making a series of confusing statements on abortion during his first week exploring a candidacy) took the stage and focused on his now-common pitch to the American people: that his success in life âdisproves the lies of the radical left.â\n\nAnd Vivek Ramaswamy, a 2024 candidate working to introduce himself to voters and build up his name recognition, revved up the crowd with his pro-America messaging and red-meat policy pitches that includes shutting down the Department of Education. On the ever-touchy topic of abortion, he told ABC News that evening that he is âunapologetically pro-life.â One of the few candidates to more directly address the rocky subject, Ramaswamy has previously said he believes the issue should be left up to the states.\n\nâDavid Weigel and Shelby Talcott\n\nBrett Bruen is the president of the Global Situation Room, a public affairs firm. He is a former U.S. diplomat and served as Director of Global Engagement at the White House under President Obama.\n\nStories that are being largely ignored by either left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, according to data from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWHAT THE LEFT ISNâT READING: New York City Mayor Eric Adams blamed the migrant crisis for hampering the cityâs post-pandemic recovery. âThe city is being destroyed,â he said during a panel discussion in Washington.\n\nWHAT THE RIGHT ISNâT READING: New data shows a 10% drop in OB/GYN residency applicants since 2022 in states that have put in place abortion bans.\n\nFridayâs newsletter misidentified David Trottâs title.

      "text": "DOGE protesters to Democrats: âDo something!â\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHundreds of protesters crowded below the Department of Laborâs steps on Wednesday, summoned by Democrats, the AFL-CIO and alerts theyâd seen online. âItâs on Constitution,â said a volunteer in a purple ACLU vest, redirecting a man who was carrying his âTHIS IS A COUPâ sign in the wrong direction.\n\nBy 3:30 p.m., the sidewalk below the stairs was full. From there, the speakers â from Congress, from labor, from the agencies being hollowed out â were barely audible.\n\nâThey donât want anyone whoâs not a white man to have a fair chance to succeed in this world,â said Emily Martin, the chief program officer at the Womenâs Law Center.\n\nâWhatâs the plan?â shouted one protester through a green knit balaclava.\n\nâThis is a government, right now by the billionaires, for the billionaires, and we will not allow it to stand!â declared Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nâDo your job!â shouted another protester, 20 feet from Markeyâs megaphone. âGo back to work!â\n\nDirect actions against the new Trump administration, in Washington and Democratic-voting state capitals , were smaller than the first protests against his first term. They impeded the work of DOGE only once: A âkickoff meetingâ between Elon Musk and DOL employees at the Frances Perkins Building was moved from in-person to virtual.\n\nâObviously, the speed is surprising,â AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler told Semafor. âThe blatant disregard for the norms that theyâre trampling on, things that could potentially be illegal â itâs sort of like, ask for forgiveness instead of permission.â\n\nThe rally broke up at 4:30 p.m., with no sign of Musk. Timothy Snyderâs book âOn Tyranny,â published weeks into the first Trump administration, was left behind on the platform where organizers had placed their amplifiers.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe speed and range of DOGE actions, and the gusher of leaks from affected federal workers, have fueled a multi-level resistance â and angst about whether any of it will work.\n\nThere is little Democrats can do to slow down Republican legislation on the Hill, and less they can do to exercise oversight if the GOP doesnât agree with them. They learned that lesson again on Wednesday, when members of the House Oversight Committee bungled a surprise vote to subpoena Musk over the details of his effort to restructure government agencies with semi-anonymous employees. (The vote was not alerted on a group text used by committee Democrats, and not all of them made it back in time.)\n\nAt the moment, congressional Democrats are playing a supplementary role in an anti-Trump resistence. They are reacting to the reporting on DOGEâs work and showing up at protests; they are cheering on lawsuits filed by attorneys general and the constellation of liberal groups that plotted out a second Trump resistance after the election.\n\nOn Monday, when Democrats gathered outside USAIDâs headquarters in solidarity with suspended workers, they were cheered on by a partially-masked crowd as they marched into the building, then were told to leave. By Wednesday, at rallies outside the Capitol and the DOL, the cheers were mixed with interruptions and boos â especially when they mentioned the lawsuits, even though several have already halted some early Trump orders.\n\nâThe Democrats are just letting Donald Trump completely control what everyoneâs talking about,â said Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff for New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who launched a challenge to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week. He did not talk to Ocasio-Cortez before announcing his campaign, he said, and Ocasio-Cortez is not taking a position in the race.\n\nâTheyâre just on their back foot playing defense,â Chakrabarti argued. âInstead, look at what the Republicans did with something like Hunter Bidenâs laptop or Hillary Clintonâs emails â both complete non-issues that they turned into issues. The Democrats have the advantage of having real stuff to talk about â a billionaire, Elon Musk, going in and leaking the information of every CIA employee in an email to the White House, canceling Head Start programs around the country, collecting peopleâs social security numbers without their consent.â\n\nTo be fair, Democrats have been running around screaming about the potential risk to CIA operations from DOGE employeesâs access to, and use of, classified information. And every out-of-power party irritates its activist base when it canât dramatically impede the work of a new administration. Republicans were initially slow to embrace the Tea Party movement organized by libertarian groups and conservative activists in 2009; Democrats were furious that key senators, and even party leaders, provided key support for the early Bush agenda in 2001.\n\nThe two basic problems for the congressional opposition are that the real power to slow Musk down resides in the courts, and that the atomized media environment makes it hard for even a news junkie to follow what theyâre doing. At one point at Wednesdayâs Labor rally, a union organizer pointed across the block to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, informing protesters that all their complaints were being filed there. But this didnât mollify protesters, a mix of federal employees and local liberals who supported the cause, from demanding that the Democrats walk in the other direction, to the Capitol, and doâ¦ something.\n\nMuskâs emergence as a high-powered Trump Inc. CEO is popular with Republicans. Theyâre very comfortable defending the work of young programmers (young, like the Founding Fathers) and an âunelectedâ billionaire disrupter (theyâve been saying âunelected bureaucratâ before these protesters were born) over the output of senior federal employees. And theyâre having fun with the sound and images of Social Security-aged Democrats doing Mario Savio impressions outside brutalist federal buildings.\n\nWhat Democrats canât say â and probably shouldnât, because it sounds ghoulish â is that the public might not care about this unless something terrible happens, something that wouldnât if the workers were inside the buildings, and not holding signs and bullhorns outside.\n\nIn his Substack, Ken Klippenstein compared the Democratsâ legal fight against DOGE to the investigations of Russian influence in the 2016 election â i.e., a political dead end.\n\nâInstead of making a plainspoken case to the public about how DOGE could negatively affect their daily lives, Democratic leaders conducted astroturfed âdemonstrationsâ in front of USAID, Treasury and other government shrines,â he wrote. âThey adopted the conspiratorial tone of the MAGA opposition to the Democrats that they have been so contemptuous of in the past.â\n\nThe Trump White House and House GOP leadership has dusted off an old playbook, highlighting the most intense rhetoric from the protests and suggesting that Democrats want a violent insurrection.\n\nâCongresswoman LaMonica McIver says, âWe are at war,ââ White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said from the Brady Room on Wednesday. âIlhan Omar says, âWe might actually see somebody get killed.â And Chris Van Hollen says, âWe have to fight this in the Congress. We have to fight this in the streets.â So what now? And may I just point out, if you heard that type of violent, enticing rhetoric from our side of the aisle, from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, I think there would be a lot more outrage in this room today.â\n\nOmar did not suggest that someone would be killed in anti-DOGE protests. In an MSNBC interview, she worried that âan American who works for the American governmentâ could be killed abroad because a USAID app used in emergencies was shut down.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "The rightâs new viral video fixation\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Feb. 24, an account with a quarter of a million followers posted two videos of a Black man harassing Asian passersby in New York. Armour Cards, a Twitter user with fewer than 700 followers, responded with an undated video of the same man insulting a white man on a subway train, babbling about his âemaciated, attenuated, tenuous body.â\n\nArmour Cards, who spoke with Semafor but chose to remain anonymous, was surprised by what happened next. The video had been recorded in 2019, âon the 1 train between 42nd and 50th St,â but was re-posted by thousands of users as evidence of anti-white harassment in todayâs New York, and of racist ideology run amok âÂ garnering hundreds of thousands of views along the way.\n\nâCongratulations Robin DiAngelo and Ibram X. Kendi,â tweeted the managing editor of the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee while sharing the footage.\n\nArmour Cards, a self-described âDeSantis conservativeâ who has a baseball signed by the Florida governor, was unsure what the authors of âWhite Fragilityâ and âHow to Be An Anti-Racistâ had to do with a disturbed man ranting on the subway, a year before the George Floyd protests made them household names.\n\nBut the broader arc of the video was unsurprising if youâve been on Twitter lately. Contextless video clips of fights, anti-white harassment, and general urban decay appear to be flooding conservative corners of social media, where theyâre shared with commentary blaming liberal prosecutors for an unchecked crime wave and progressives for racial division.\n\nOn Twitter, short footage can grab millions of views, sometimes helped along by accounts that have been restored under Elon Muskâs ownership after being banned under the previous regime for violating hate and harassment rules. Anti-hate groups are worried that the new social media environment is giving extremists a wedge into the mainstream political conversation, including with viral videos. The version of the subway video shared by the Babylon Bee editor, for example, came from an account almost exclusively devoted to curating similar clips alongside openly white supremacist commentary.\n\nAt least one prominent conservative user who has been harshly critical of the leftâs take on crime and race is unnerved by what he sees as a steady stream of vaguely sourced rage-bait.\n\nâVideos like this have been making it to everybodyâs timeline,â said Ian Miles Cheong , a Malaysia-based journalist who covers culture and technology, referring to one recent viral clip as âgarbage from four years ago.â\n\nCheong is a popular figure on the right for his own online commentary skewering left-wing activists, which includes sharing viral footage of violence and provocations. But he says heâs personally urged Musk, who sometimes interacts with him on Twitter, to identify inflammatory videos, limit their reach, and add more context via the siteâs âCommunity Notesâ feature.\n\nâI think itâs something that they really need to cut down on,â he said. âI donât want to watch fights every time that I log on to Twitter.â\n\nMusk, who relishes weighing in on hot topics among the siteâs âanti-wokeâ users, has so far been an active consumer. âEven though this clip is from 2005, it is still a super messed up thing to say,â he replied on Twitter this week, after a far-right commentator shared an old C-SPAN clip of a Black bookstore ownerâs call for the âexterminationâ of white people. The embedded tweet that caught Muskâs eye, which called the rant evidence of a âcoordinated plotâ by the left, did not include the date.\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn the 21st century, viral footage is political currency for both the left and right. Videos of brutal arrests or protester crackdowns have fueled reform campaigns in liberal cities; videos of shoplifting sprees and obnoxious protestors have fueled conservative calls for a crackdown on crime and a rejection of activist demands.\n\nAnd if you want a story of panic about a context-free video going wildly wrong, remember what happened when the progressive Twitter-sphere got furious at a video of a Native American activist chanting at a teenager with a MAGA hat.\n\nBut thereâs something especially familiar about the recent imagery on the right, which has popped up in different formats for many decades.\n\nAfter President Obamaâs election, brawls featuring Black teenagers were cited by some right-leaning media as signs of ârace warâ and civilizational collapse. âIn Obamaâs America, the white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering,â the late Rush Limbaugh famously declared while discussing a then-viral clip of a fight on a school bus that had been featured on Drudge Report.\n\nThat kind of race-baiting language has been returning again around the current wave of videos, pictures, and anecdotes now crashing through social media. Watching them take off in real time, each viral incident is a nexus where large extremist accounts try to win over more mainstream conservatives in replies and quote tweets.\n\nTake a clip that went viral this week showcasing a weekend brawl between teenagers at the Stonestown Galleria, a mall not far from San Francisco State University.\n\nStew Peters, a far right commentator, garnered over 2 million views with a tweet promoting the footage as part of a âwar on Whitesâ that parents should respond to by âpackinâ HEAT!â\n\nBy the end of the evening, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah had shared Petersâ video to his own followers while endorsing âattempted murderâ charges for violent teens, who he called criminals âwithout civilizationâ who proved âwhy we canât turn our backs on the Second Amendment.â\n\nMany conservatives see videos of individual incidents as a counter to progressive denial about anti-social behavior and unsafe public spaces after the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea that cities are devolving into war zones is potent on the right; a popular reaction to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggâs expected indictment of Donald Trump was that the Democrat was distracted by anti-GOP politics as he let crime rage across his city.\n\nThis type of footage has also long been standard fare on local news. Videos, like the San Francisco brawl get media attention , and promises of help, from city leaders â who are often Democrats .\n\nBut the trend comes as farther out fringes of the right, including some figures with major followings, are using their reach to call for open prejudice toward Black Americans. These two streams are now constantly linking up on social media. It would be wrong to pretend not to see whatâs going on.\n\nTwitter does not have an active press department , but has rebutted accusations that hate speech is becoming more common on the site, citing an independent study they commissioned.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Technology\n\nHi, and welcome back to Semafor Tech.\n\nEarlier this week, my Semafor colleague Alan Haburchak noticed that the AI image generation tool Adobe Firefly was making the same kind of mistakes that caused such an uproar when Googleâs Gemini model made them.\n\nIn case you missed it, Google was accused by conservatives of âwokenessâ after its image generator made historically inaccurate images, replacing white people with people of color. In some situations, it refused to generate images of white people. The company removed the tool and apologized .\n\nOther image generator tools from companies like Meta have made similar errors. What I thought was interesting about Firefly is that Adobe has been almost overly cautious, using only stock or licensed images to train its models. But I think it supports the idea that these mistakes are more tech problems than culture problems.\n\nRead below for more on this topic.\n\nâ MOVE FAST : Moving on . China is learning to live with U.S. efforts to restrict access to advanced chips. In one of the latest examples, an AI assistant for neurosurgeons will be tested at seven hospitals there, deciphering data from MRIs, ultrasounds and other tests. Later, it could be more involved in the treatment process, like warning surgeons of risky procedures.\n\nâ BREAK THINGS : Just getting started. Todayâs passage of a U.S. House bill to force a sale of TikTok or ban it is just one battle in whatâs likely to be a long fight. The plan faces higher hurdles in the Senate. And if it becomes law, TikTok can turn to the courts, where it has successfully challenged similar moves.\n\nThe U.K.âs Advanced Research and Invention Agency launched its first funded program today, a $54 million push to develop AI at 1/1000th of the current cost by bringing down compute hardware expenses. The money, doled out over four years, will go to researchers and engineers, and also to chemists and biologists to explore how nature efficiently processes information and how that can be applied to AI development.\n\nThe agency notes that for decades, people have benefited by having increasing computing power at lower cost but that no longer applies in the AI age. âOur current mechanisms for training AI systems utilise a narrow set of algorithms and hardware building blocks, which require significant capital to develop and manufacture,â it said. âThe combination of this significance and scarcity has far-reaching economic, geopolitical and societal implications.â\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nFirefly, Adobeâs AI image creation tool, repeats some of the same controversial mistakes that Googleâs Gemini made in inaccurate racial and ethnic depictions, illustrating the challenges tech companies face across the industry.\n\nGoogle shut down its Gemini image creation tool last month after critics pointed out that it was creating historically inaccurate images, depicting Americaâs Founding Fathers as Black, for instance, and refusing to depict white people. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees the company â got it wrong .â\n\nThe tests done by Semafor on Firefly replicated many of the same things that tripped up Gemini. The two services rely on similar techniques for creating images from written text, but they are trained on very different datasets. Adobe uses only stock images or images that it licenses.\n\nAdobe and Google also have different cultures. Adobe, a more traditionally structured company, has never been a hotbed of employee activism like Google. The common denominator is the core technology for image generation, and companies can attempt to corral it, but there is no guaranteed way to do it.\n\nI asked Firefly to create images using similar prompts that got Gemini in trouble. It created Black soldiers fighting for Nazi Germany in World War II. In scenes depicting the Founding Fathers and the constitutional convention in 1787, Black men and women were inserted into roles. When I asked it to create a comic book character of an old white man, it drew one, but also gave me three others of a Black man, a Black woman and a white woman. And yes, it even drew me a picture of Black Vikings, just like Gemini.\n\nThe source of this kind of result is an attempt by the modelâs designers to ensure that certain groups of people avoid racist stereotypes â that doctors not all be white men, for instance, or that criminals not fall into racial stereotypes. But the projection of those efforts into historical contexts has infuriated some on the right who see it as the AI trying to rewrite history along the lines of todayâs politics.\n\nThe Adobe results show how this issue is not exclusive to one company or one type of model. And Adobe has, more than most big tech companies, tried to do everything by the book. It trained its algorithm on stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content so that its customers could use its tool without worries about copyright infringement.\n\nAdobe didnât respond to a request for comment.\n\nReed's view on why this is a problem inherent in the AI architecture. â\n\nReed's view on why this is a problem inherent in the AI architecture. â\n\nSen.

See all speakers, sessions & RSVP here .\n\nI just got back from a few days at SXSW. Well-adjusted people go there to listen to music, watch movies, and eat some good barbecue. I spent most of my time there talking with people about AI.\n\nOn Monday, I interviewed Shane Legg, co-founder and chief AGI scientist at Google DeepMind. That ventureâs other two co-founders, Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, have bigger public profiles, but Legg stands out in another way.\n\nIn 2010 when DeepMind was founded, the people who studied existential risk in AI usually werenât the scientists actually building the technology. Legg was an exception. He was one of the few AI researchers willing to question the safety of the entire endeavor.\n\nNow, visions of AGI are beginning to materialize and people like Legg believe itâs about to drastically change our world.\n\nOn the road to general intelligence, DeepMindâs greatest accomplishments have been in narrow areas. In a proof of concept demonstration, it defeated the world champion of the board game Go . It revolutionized biotech with its protein fold breakthrough . It used AI to get us closer to nuclear fusion and it upended the science of weather prediction .\n\nSo my question to Legg at the event: If building âgeneralâ intelligence is potentially dangerous, why not just keep building these narrow applications, which have already led to so many world-changing results?\n\nOne response to that is obvious: Somebodyâs going to build it, so it might as well be us. But Legg said something else that I thought was interesting. As AI models get bigger, researchers are noticing a principle of crossover skills. The act of learning one language, for instance, allows an AI model to pick up entirely different languages more quickly. You might call it a kind of artificial wisdom.\n\nOne vision of how AGI might play out, Legg said, is that weâll have super-intelligence models that, when tasked with a narrow problem, will create software tools to solve it. Thatâs what humans do it today.\n\nWhat Legg said was bouncing around in my head on Tuesday, when Google DeepMind briefed reporters on a new research project called Sima, an AI agent that learned the fundamentals of playing video games and can now play new games itâs never seen before, without any additional training.\n\nSome of the big breakthroughs in AI came from playing chess, Go, and video games. But those AI models were designed to win a particular game â not actually understand them. Sima doesnât know how to win video games, but there may be power in its ability to generally understand them. Winning could come later.\n\nLegg told me he came to believe in 2001 that we would have a 50/50 chance of reaching AGI by 2028. He says that number is still about right. If thatâs true, and all these recent breakthroughs are the final leaps toward truly intelligent machines, we are in for a massive disruption in our way of life.\n\nâThis is a deep, deep change,â Legg said. âTo be honest, itâs hard to wrap my head around.â\n\nBillionaire Frank McCourt, with the help of journalist Michael Casey, is out with a new book on what social media has wrought on society. In Our Biggest Fight , McCourt argues that users have essentially become serfs of big tech companies like Meta, Google owner Alphabet and Apple, which have created a digital feudalist system. His answer: Decentralized Social Networking Protocol, which helps users take back control over their digital identities and data. McCourt says such a move would be good for our well being and for our democracy. Whether itâs actually a solution and even realistic, itâs a provocative concept as we grapple with how AI will change our lives.\n\nCognition, a new AI startup that came out of stealth Tuesday , is the talk of the automated coding world. Weâve written extensively in this newsletter about AI code generation, which was the first commercial use case of generative AI. The leader in that space is Microsoft-owned GitHub, which offers the coding assistant âCopilotâ that helps coders complete tedious work.\n\nCognition takes the concept a step further with its AI coding tool called Devin, which can build an entire coding project from scratch, essentially allowing anyone to be a software developer. Thatâs something most experts in the field were saying was many years away.\n\nSo how was Cognition, which says it will launch a product soon, able to beat the big players? According to my X feed, theyâre simply geniuses. A video is circulating around the internet of co-founder Scott Wu as a kid absolutely slaying a math contest. The fact that itâs taken less than 24 hours for one of Cognitionâs founders to become a tech folk hero says something about the AI startup era.\n\nSign up for Semafor technology"

Pretoria has been scrambling to appoint a new US ambassador since Ebrahim Rasool was booted out of Washington last week after criticizing US President Donald Trump during a webinar.\n\nColleagues described Nel as an uncontroversial figure: âHe wonât speak out of line. He is a smart guy and his messaging will be disciplined,â said an ANC official. Nel is of Afrikaans heritage, though people familiar with the matter said that is not why he is being proposed: The US cut funding to South Africa over a land law it said discriminates against white farmers and offered asylum to Afrikaners. Nel was part of South Africaâs liberation struggle and has been a deputy minister since 2009.\n\nRead on for more about the ambassador frontrunner. â\n\nRead on for more about the ambassador frontrunner. â\n\nBritainâs development finance body is working with Londonâs financial district to ramp up funding for sustainable energy projects in Africa as the impact of Washingtonâs withdrawal from global climate commitments intensifies.\n\nLeslie Maasdorp, who was appointed British International Investmentâs CEO late last year, said the UK sought to play a â bigger global leadership role â on climate finance by mobilizing capital from institutional investors, pension funds, and insurance companies.\n\nMaasdorp said BII â which directed around 60% of its Â£1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) in investments in 2023 to projects in Africa â had begun âengagingâ with the City of London after receiving Â£100 million from the UK government in September to attract private capital. He said BII also played a key role by de-risking climate projects across Africa. âThereâs clearly a gap between what people perceive as the risk and what the real risks are,â he said.\n\nRead on for why the UK is investing in Africa. â\n\nRead on for why the UK is investing in Africa. â\n\nThe presidents of DR Congo and Rwanda met in Qatar for their first direct talks since the Kigali-backed M23 rebels accelerated their offensive in eastern DR Congo. All parties called for an â immediate and unconditional ceasefire â at the meeting on Tuesday, committing to further discussions âto establish solid foundations for lasting peace.â Kigaliâs participation is notable: Rwanda has denied backing the M23, and had earlier insisted on direct dialogue between Kinshasa and the rebels. It was unclear if M23 would heed the call for a truce. The group pulled out of a separate planned meeting with DR Congo leaders in Angola on Tuesday over sanctions imposed by the European Union on some senior M23 members.\n\nThe talks also cast a spotlight on Qatar, which has worked as a mediator in several conflicts in recent months, most notably between Israel and Hamas. Doha shares close ties with Rwanda: Qatar Airways has been closing in on a long-discussed deal to take a 49% stake in Rwandaâs national airline and a 60% stake in a new international airport outside Kigali.\n\nSouth African bank Absa poached a leading executive at giant rival Standard Bank to be its new CEO, ending months of speculation over who would take the top job. The move also raises questions about succession planning at Standard Bank, which is Africaâs largest bank by assets.\n\nAnalysts described the hire of Kenny Fihla, Standard Bankâs deputy CEO, as a win for Absa, whose shares rose 3.5% after the announcement. Absa â South Africaâs third-largest bank by assets â had lost market share under the leadership of its last CEO, an appointment that prompted South Africaâs most powerful investor, Public Investment Corp, to criticize Absa for choosing a white man as its CEO in a corporate environment with few Black leaders.\n\nâThe board will need to back Kenny fully to make difficult cultural and strategic changes at Absa that are necessary,â one analyst told News24. In an editorial, Business Day put it more bluntly, asking if Fihla â could break Absaâs leadership curse. â Sim Tshabalala has been Standard Bankâs CEO since 2013 and maintained its position as Africaâs largest lender by assets. Fihla was widely seen as being groomed to succeed Tshabalala, who is now 57, and his departure has created uncertainty over a succession plan.\n\nThe cost of a proposed airport in Ethiopia to be built by Ethiopian Airlines and the African Development Bank . Known as Bishoftu , the new airport is expected to be Africaâs largest, surpassing South Africaâs O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. A location previously occupied by farmers outside of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa has been secured, Bloomberg reported. Ethiopian Airlines is Africaâs largest carrier by number of passengers carried. The new airport is projected to triple the countryâs annual passenger capacity from 17 million now to more than 60 million by 2040.\n\nSeveral African nations could soon run out of HIV drugs following Washingtonâs freeze on foreign aid, although a US court ordered the decision reversed. The White House has sought to shutter USAID as part of efforts to cut government spending: Its funding program for HIV drugs is credited with saving 26 million lives, and its potential closure threatens to â undo 20 years of progress ,â the World Health Organization chief said. Six African countries â Burkina Faso, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Nigeria, and South Sudan â are among the eight expected to run out of the medicines. A US judge said the move âlikely violatesâ the constitution , although the administration said it would appeal, decrying ârogue judges.â\n\nThis item first appeared in Flagship, Semaforâs daily global affairs newsletter.

      "text": "Adobe Firefly repeats the same AI blunders as Google Gemini\n\nSign up for Semafor Technology: Whatâs next in the new era of tech. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nFirefly, Adobeâs AI image creation tool, repeats some of the same controversial mistakes that Googleâs Gemini made in inaccurate racial and ethnic depictions, illustrating the challenges tech companies face across the industry.\n\nGoogle shut down its Gemini image creation tool last month after critics pointed out that it was creating historically inaccurate images, depicting Americaâs Founding Fathers as Black, for instance, and refusing to depict white people. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees the company â got it wrong .â\n\nThe tests done by Semafor on Firefly replicated many of the same things that tripped up Gemini. The two services rely on similar techniques for creating images from written text, but they are trained on very different datasets. Adobe uses only stock images or images that it licenses.\n\nAdobe and Google also have different cultures. Adobe, a more traditionally structured company, has never been a hotbed of employee activism like Google. The common denominator is the core technology for image generation, and companies can attempt to corral it, but there is no guaranteed way to do it.\n\nI asked Firefly to create images using similar prompts that got Gemini in trouble. It created Black soldiers fighting for Nazi Germany in World War II. In scenes depicting the Founding Fathers and the constitutional convention in 1787, Black men and women were inserted into roles. When I asked it to create a comic book character of an old white man, it drew one, but also gave me three others of a Black man, a Black woman and a white woman. And yes, it even drew me a picture of Black Vikings, just like Gemini.\n\nThe source of this kind of result is an attempt by the modelâs designers to ensure that certain groups of people avoid racist stereotypes âÂ that doctors not all be white men, for instance, or that criminals not fall into racial stereotypes. But the projection of those efforts into historical contexts has infuriated some on the right who see it as the AI trying to rewrite history along the lines of todayâs politics.\n\nThe Adobe results show how this issue is not exclusive to one company or one type of model. And Adobe has, more than most big tech companies, tried to do everything by the book. It trained its algorithm on stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content so that its customers could use its tool without worries about copyright infringement.\n\n* This story has been updated to include a statement from Adobe.\n\nIn this article:\n\nâAdobe Firefly is built to help people ideate, create and build upon their natural creativity,â the company said in a statement. âIt isnât meant for generating photorealistic depictions of real or historical events. Adobeâs commitment to responsible innovation includes training our AI models on diverse datasets to ensure weâre producing commercially safe results that donât perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This includes extensively testing outputs for risk and to ensure they match the reality of the world we live in. Given the nature of Gen AI and the amount of data it gets trained on, it isnât always going to be correct, and we recognize that these Firefly images are inadvertently off base. We build feedback mechanisms in all of our Gen AI products, so we can see any issues and fix them through retraining or adjusting filters. Our focus is always improving our models to give creators a set of options to bring their visions to life.â\n\nSo-called foundation models are extremely powerful tools, but companies do not release them without putting in place a series of guardrails to keep them from veering off course.\n\nWithout these guardrails, the models would gladly help users build chemical weapons, write malicious software code or venture off into nonsensical tangents.\n\nOne technique for keeping them in line is called reinforcement learning with human feedback, where the models can be steered into proper behavior patterns by rewarding them when they act in the desired way.\n\nBut that technique only goes so far. Companies also add elaborate prompts that are normally invisible to the customers prompting chatbots and image generators. Known as system prompts, they contain a series of instructions, including asking the LLM to create a range of ethnicities when generating images of people.\n\nEven then, user prompts can be transformed in the background before they even reach the LLM theyâre using. By the time anyone asks a chatbot or image generator to do something, itâs many steps removed from the raw AI model doing most of the work.\n\nThe Google Gemini scandal has perturbed conservatives and led to calls for the resignation of Pichai, Alphabetâs CEO. The narrative from this point of view is that Pichai has allowed the company to infuse its AI tools with âwokeâ politics. This is also the view of some Google employees.\n\nIn this newsletter, Iâve shared my somewhat contrarian view on this. I think it shows a technical shortcoming in the way large language models work. And thatâs not unique to Google; itâs inherent in the architecture that powers generative AI.\n\nEarlier this week, my Semafor colleague Alan Haburchak pointed out that he was seeing similar results in Adobe Firefly, the image generation service that launched about a year ago.\n\nAdobe lacks Googleâs high profile and hasnât become a political target, but he wasnât the first person to point out the problem. I found Adobe customers complaining about this issue last May. âIâm creating a comic and one of the characters happens to be an elderly white man,â one customer wrote . âBut Firefly insists on giving me a âdiverseâ mix of images, one black, one hispanic, one asian, one white.â\n\nâWhoever is throttling your system is part of the woke religion,â another customer wrote.\n\nPartly because the internet was created and first popularized in the U.S., white people are overrepresented in the datasets used to train the algorithm. And itâs difficult for todaysâ large language models to grasp that their designers want diverse representation in some situations, but historical accuracy in others.\n\nThis problem will get closer to being solved when AI models become more capable and can better understand the nuances and meaning of language.\n\nBen Thompson argues that Googleâs mishaps â like refusing to promote meat â are not really mishaps at all, but the result of an extreme left-wing point of view infused into the technology by a company whose culture has run amok.\n\nâThe biggest question of all, though, is Google,â Thompson said. âAgain, this is a company that should dominate AI, thanks to their research and their infrastructure. The biggest obstacle, though, above and beyond business model, is clearly culture. To that end, the nicest thing you can say about Googleâs management is to assume that they, like me and everyone else, just want to build products and not be yelled at; that, though, is not leadership.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor technology"

Aardman, based in Bristol, England, which made its name with the legendary Wallace and Gromit series, remains one of the last practitioners of old-school stop-motion animation, rather than CGI. A 24-frame second of film takes an animator an entire day: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit took 15 months to animate. Dawn of the Nugget has not reunited the entire original cast . Mel Gibson, the voice of the purportedly heroic Rocky, has been replaced, while Julia Sawalha, original voice of the main character Ginger, said she was dropped because her voice now sounded too old .\n\nLebanonâs basketball team will go to the FIBA World Cup this month, bringing rare positive news to a country in crisis, reported Al Jazeera. The Lebanese team beat the Philippines with a dramatic late three-pointer last August before defeating India in a playoff. Last year they also made the final of Asia Cup and lifted the Arab Championship. The countryâs newfound competitiveness at the sport brings â ââmuch-needed joy, solidarity and hope â as Lebanon grapples with a financial collapse and the aftermath of the devastating Beirut port explosion. âThanks to this game,â one fan said, âwe can experience pride in something called Lebanon rather than in parties, sects or politics.â\n\nThe iceberg lettuce is enjoying a revival. Icebergs were popular throughout the 20th century because they could survive long train journeys: They did not perish for weeks. âA newspaper article from 1928 glowingly describes trains nearly a mile long racing to distribute lettuce,â reported Atlas Obscura. But by the turn of the 21st, the iceberg had become âhopelessly passÃ©,â replaced by â turrets of microgreens and edible flowers .â Thatâs changed again: The iceberg may have next to zero nutritional value, but itâs crunchy and tasty in a wedge salad lathered in ranch and bacon. âTen years ago, everybody started eating kale,â says one chef, âand then they probably realized kale is kind of, whatever, itâs fine, but whatâs more fun to eat?â\n\nA South Korean company is making Lockheed Martin-branded clothes. Mashable reported that consumers can buy â streetwear-style jeans and oversized tees â bearing the logo and, in some cases, products of the âdefense contractor accused of aiding war criminals.â Apparently the licensing and use of random-seeming Western companiesâ logos is a common practise in Korean clothing design: âJeep, National Geographic, and even defunct airline Pan Am have been reimagined as streetwear brands,â rather like âAmericans get tattoos of Chinese symbols even though they donât speak Mandarin.â The F-35 T-shirt is, it should be admitted, pretty cool.\n\nSeminal events, like the partition of India and Pakistan, have impacts that are everyday as well as historical: That is a message of New Delhiâs recently opened Partition Museum. The site opened in May after first being established in the northern city of Amritsar. Inside the Delhi branch are an array of household objects carried across what was then a newly created border, as well as wedding photographs, letters, and notebooks, âscattered in glass cases amid newspaper cutting and documentary photos of violence and migration,â Indiaâs Outlook magazine wrote. âPerhaps to help the visitors connect the dots between the personal and the political .â\n\nEach weekend, weâll tell you what a great independent bookstore suggests you read.\n\nMexico Cityâs El PÃ©ndulo bookshop recommends Mohsin Hamidâs latest novel, The Last White Man . The book is a âstory about love, loss and rediscoveryâ told from the perspective of a white man whose life suddenly changes when he wakes up dark-skinned. Buy The Last White Man from El PÃ©ndulo or from your local bookshop .\n\nWine consumption in China in 2022 fell by more than half from its peak in 2017 to just 8.8 million hectolitres, according to the International Organisation of Vine. The figure â the lowest since 1997 â has brought down global wine consumption and made China just the eighth-biggest wine market. Sales began dropping since 2018 but accelerated after the COVID-19 pandemic, during which China imposed some of some of the worldâs harshest lockdowns. âGrowing grapes is like doing business in China. You need to be thick-skinned, â the owner of a vineyard in the country said.\n\nThe number of bananas consumed each year. The banana is the worldâs most popular fresh fruit: The average American eats about 27 lbs of them annually , reported Emily Monosson in LitHub. There are around 1,000 different cultivated varieties of banana, including plantains and lady fingers, but the big, bright-yellow ones Westerners see in supermarkets â the Cavendish â make up half of global sales. They only reached world dominance in the 1960s, when crops of the previous most popular cultivar, the Gros Michel, were devastated by a fungus to which the Cavendish was resistant. Now, a new fungal strain threatens the Cavendish.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship"

People feel confident theyâre going to win the election. Republicans do. Any internal divisions in the party have basically been purged. So itâs this MAGA celebration with a little thread of belief that Donald Trump was spared, essentially, by God from this horrible assassination attempt. So people are even being nice to journalists, is the outcome of that.\n\nNayeema: Yeah. Well, he is, as we played in a song that Max Tawney gave us, the chosen one.\n\nBen: People believed that before a bit, and then you donât have to be that religious to believe that when a bullet gets that close to someone.\n\nNayeema: And then, of course, the third media cycle, President Biden has contracted Covid. The walls seem to be closing in. Iâm sure thatâs making people, I donât know. Are they praying for him or are they laughing about that?\n\nBen: Theyâre laughing. I was sitting in the Grand Hotel here where all the campaign staff stay, or the senior ones, when it flashed on Fox News, which is all of the screens, that Biden had Covid, and it was, I feel like the reaction was sort of incredulous/sympathetic laughter. It was just, are you kidding? But, again, it feels biblical.\n\nNayeema: The walls seemed to be really closing in around him with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, pressing him to get out, and then Semafor had this big scoop the other day where Jeffrey Katzenberg is telling Biden that the money is running dry.\n\nBen: This three weeks, I think, took an election that journalists were spending a lot of time complaining was boring and predictable into the most the kind of politics that would make a laughable West Wing script that nobody would believe. Beginning with rising pressure, which is a year too late, following that terrible debate President Biden had, on Biden to leave the race, which he, at first, seemed to be resisting and is getting harder and harder to resist, which then flowed into the assassination attempt, Trumpâs miraculous survival, and the Republican arrival in Milwaukee for the MAGA coronation.\n\nNayeema: You talk about it being some West Wing script, but it also, it has this real man energy to everything thatâs going on right now. Last week we talked about gender being a key undercurrent of this election, and I think thatâs whatâs crystallized in the last few weeks is that Donald Trump has really, genuinely, deeply cemented his place in the manosphere, whether thatâs with UFC, black boxing, the church, the Silicon Valley tech bros, the crypto crowd, and itâs probably best captured in what has emerged in the last three weeks as this quintessentially manly image of the former president fist pumped in the air, blood on his ear in cheek, American flag in the background, and mouth open to say, âFight, fight, fight,â which is just moments after literally dodging a bullet. Did that picture inspire manliness for you, Ben? Did you feel like more or less of a man looking at that image?\n\nBen: I think Iâm going to dodge that question, but incredible image. Yeah, I think in some sense, the media story is it is these deep connections between this new both online media of figures, by the way, like Joe Rogan who was a martial arts fighter.\n\nNayeema: Which is actually the best training for interviewing, I think.\n\nBen: Yeah, I guess it worked out. You just get hit in the head a lot and then it improves your skills. And Trumpâs connection to the UFC. Remember right after his conviction in New York, he went to a UFC fight.\n\nAnnouncer: Being ushered in by UFC CEO, Dana White, Donald Trump is in the building, and the former presidentâs getting a standing ovation from the assembled masses.\n\nBen: So much of this convention is aimed at young men and you really feel it here. I bet you feel it on the other side of the TV, too.\n\nNayeema: I do. Well, I donât know if I feel it, but I donât think Iâm the intended audience.\n\nBen: Sure theyâll be glad to have you.\n\nNayeema: Letâs take a quick break to meditate on the manliness of Donald Trump and unpack it when weâre back.\n\n[Music]\n\nNayeema: In a moment. Weâre going to dive into the manosphere, but letâs talk about the big news this weekend, which was the assassination. You and I traded texts that night, Ben. It was past midnight for me. I was in Italy, and then of course I texted you, my podcast partner, Ben. Where were you?\n\nBen: I was at home scrambling.\n\nNayeema: You texted me back that image and I was like, thatâs the shot on a film set. You see the image and youâre like, oh, we got the shot, we can wrap. Iconic, scary, shocking.\n\nBen: I think a lot of people in Trumpâs orbit actually found it maybe shocking, but not surprising. I\n\nNayeema: Think that when these kind of breaking news moments happen, thereâs just wall to wall media environment and I think thereâs a sense that theyâre like, oh, everybodyâs just creating clickbait. But then there seemed to be this shyness of the media to come in here, a little bit of self-censorship, and then also if you say the wrong thing, you will be pounced on.\n\nBen: Arenât you afraid to say the wrong thing, and shouldnât you be? Do you not feel that?\n\nNayeema: As we tape this?\n\nBen: Sure. Somebody tried to assassinate the former president. Donât you think itâs worth being a little? I donât know.\n\nNayeema: Are you worried, Ben, about saying the wrong thing?\n\nBen: No, heâll be pounced on, on Twitter, who cares? But honestly, at this point, I think you have to sort of restrain the impulse to analysis and focus on trying to tell people what happened, which is certainly what we were doing at Semafor, and why it happened and how meaningful political actors were responding, which was sometimes very responsibly, sometimes in totally lunatic ways. Got a piece of guidance on how to cover this from the top aid to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder, and then this aid, Dmitri Melhornâs advice was to really seriously consider the possibility that it was a Putin style staged attack. People had some very strange and revealing reactions.\n\nNayeema: Revealing of their own biases or what they wanted to see, it was like a Rorschach test of the assassination. I guess there was also this fear of saying the wrong thing, which led to some media muting of shows like Morning Joe on Monday morning and John Stewartâs daily show.\n\nBen: The most cautious elements of kind of the big corporate media I think were particularly concerned. NBC Universal told the people at Morning Joe that they had some other feed they wanted to air and kept them off the air on Monday morning. I think Max learned basically because they were afraid they might say something inflammatory or insufficiently sympathetic to the former president.\n\nNayeema: Yes, being insensitive.\n\nBen: And Joe Scarboroughâs just furious about that when he realized that heâd been tricked off the air at this huge news moment.\n\nNayeema: We have a clip of that. Letâs play that clip.\n\nJoe Scarborough: Next time weâre told thereâs going to be a newsfeed replacing us, we will be in our chairs.\n\nMika Brzezinski: Weâll be sitting here.\n\nJoe Scarborough: And the newsfeed will be us or they can get somebody else.\n\nMika Brzezinski: Weâll still be sitting here.\n\nJoe Scarborough: To host the show.\n\nBen: Oh, wow. Yeah,\n\nNayeema: Jominka not very happy.\n\nBen: It was a huge vote of no confidence from their bosses and them to say, weâre not confident in you not to say something insane on television, which actually, it seemed unfair in my opinion.\n\nNayeema: You were your panelists, presumably.\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nNayeema: There has been a much more long-running battle between Donald Trump and the media. Both sides would say that the other has put a target on their backs. Is that insensitive? You seem like itâs insensitive to say.\n\nBen: Weâll let that pass, but thanks for checking.\n\nNayeema: The media would say that Donald Trump has put a target on their back. Donald Trump would say the media put a target on his back. I think thereâs been this long-running fight, and in this environment, thereâs this chilling effect.\n\nBen: Yeah, itâs a very dark, scary moment, and I think people in the media reacted with a caution that was both just appropriate. We donât know whatâs going on, itâs a genuine crisis, the take, economy can pause for a minute, but also I think a real physical fear. If you saw in the minutes after the shooting, people turned around in that press pen or turned around at that rally in Butler, Pennsylvania and screaming at the journalists, âYou did this.â\n\nNayeema: This is a highly charged environment. People in the crowd are injured, hit, theyâre rushing to get out. There is actually a shot taken by an attendee, Corey Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter, another military veteran is also severely injured in this. This is a very charged moment. I imagine people are really fearful, but the fact that they turned to the media that were there and blame them, thatâs very revealing, right?\n\nBen: Yeah, it makes me really sad, honestly, because theyâre yelling, I bet youâre, either basically blaming the media and then also saying, I think sincerely, âAre you happy, now?â I think you can legitimately argue, is the media too hard on Donald Trump? Whatever. Thatâs a different conversation, but it is worth pausing to say, I do not think that anybody in the media was rooting for Donald Trump to get shot.\n\nNayeema: No.\n\nBen: And there was a thread of the folks who really support Trump. It really deeply believed that the media is out to get him. There was this thing that made me saddest was this Facebook post by one of his relatives saying-\n\nNayeema: The daughter, Allison.\n\nBen: Yes. She said that the media will not tell you that he died a real life superhero. Theyâre not going to tell you how quickly he threw my mom and I to the ground. Theyâre not going to tell you that he shielded my body from the bullet that came at us. She obviously had just the most utterly horrible experience, but also, of course the media is going to tell you that. Iâm sure the media was all over her trying to get her to come on television and tell exactly that story and the idea that she thinks that American journalists are going to cover that up really makes me sad. And sheâs been told things about the media that arenât true.\n\nNayeema: Well, yeah, that one really broke my heart. That is just an unimaginable loss. Heâs certainly a hero in that story, and I think the media definitely does want to tell and has told that story, and yet, it shows this distrust of the media, this bifurcation. And Ohioâs junior senator, and now Trumpâs VP also chimed in, JD Vance, didnât blame the media, but blamed Biden tweeting immediately that today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trumpâs attempted assassination.\n\nBen: And again, thatâs strictly speaking not true. We think the shooter seems to have Googled Biden, Googled Trump, seems to have been a different kind of lunatic, but that sentiment, very, very clear across the Republican party.\n\nNayeema: And yet, one corner of the media like Twitter X, a lot of people thought when Elon Musk took over Twitter that it was going to fade into some backdrop. A lot of journalists left the platform out of concerns of how heâs running it and lack of content moderation, et cetera, and yet, in moments like this, Twitter really takes off.\n\nBen: Itâs still the live conversation, although also, a disaster area. Staged was immediately trending, the word, the notion that it was staged. Some poor Italian soccer journalists got named as the shooter and millions of impressions of blue check marks, not a particularly functioning place, but very important.\n\nNayeema: The AI feature, Grok, was pushing out a Twitter moment headline suggesting that Kamala Harris was shot because the AI was feeding into what is happening and pushing it forward. And Elon Musk, Silicon Valley rushing to make their endorsements of Trump very clear reaching into their pocketbooks after this moment, Linda Yaccarino jumping up to say, âImagine a world without X after a weekend like this past weekend. Letâs stick together in the days ahead and stick to X always.â Really a big moment for Twitter, for misinformation, for conspiracy, but I think itâs really important to say this was happening on both sides of the equation.\n\nBen: And I think, as you say, itâs funny. I think theyâve trained people to not believe anything there successfully, because there were these nonsense lies everywhere. But I think consumers have now learned to not trust anything, which is its own obvious problem.\n\nNayeema: But then also, this hugely valuable user generated content that comes out in these moments, as well, which is a new part of news.\n\nBen: Did you find the user generated content valuable? I thought what was so valuable was just the facts emerging mostly from professional reporters like the BBCâs Gary OâDonoghue interviewing somebody on the scene, and that was all living on Twitter. But actually, I think the stuff I found myself consuming, actually, was more journalism.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, I think it is the journalism, but itâs analysis that content comes from somewhere. I think that Bell and Kat, these platforms that make sense of all the social noise thatâs out there, the New York Times Visual Investigations Team, Malachy Browne, they just did a visual analysis coming from all these different videos that have been posted online, and I think that there is useful information coming out of the noise. It just takes some interpretation, right?\n\nBen: Yeah. Our job is to filter it, in a way, thatâs right.\n\nNayeema: Exactly. So it plays a part. But a lightning round before we move on. One, Iâm sad I didnât join you in Milwaukee, Ben, what is the vibe?\n\nBen: Yeah, the vibe just could not be more different from what the media expected. Networks literally brought big security teams, and actually, Kadia and I got a little roughed up by the detail of one of the NBC talent security rushing her from point A to point B, lest she be bothered by Republicans. But in fact, the Republicans are in such a good mood. I havenât been at a political convention, so free of conflict, so free of tension. The Parties entirely belongs to Donald Trump,\n\nNayeema: But theyâre also very chanting. JD Vance, JD Vance.\n\nCrowd: JD, JD, JD.\n\nNayeema: JD Vance has been announced, heâs a, I think, a really smart add to the ticket. Someone who fits into two worlds that Donald Trump talks to but never really fit into, which is the base that comes from this Appalachian heritage and this Midwestern background, but also the elite. He went to Yale, and Donald Trump has never really fit into either of those worlds in the right way, and JD Vance does that. Howâs the reaction been to him?\n\nBen: Yeah, pretty rapturous, very well received, very. I think theyâre going to struggle to take his most extreme statements around social policy and things like that, and tar him as an extremist, which theyâre certainly going to try to do, but I donât think thatâs necessarily how people are going to experience him.\n\nNayeema: And the ticket is not just the men on this ticket, but also the women. Last time we talked about the trends from girl bossing, to stay at home girlfriends, and the Trump-Vance ticket is also a Melania-Usha ticket, as well, which I think, by the way, is a very, very compelling ticket. You have Melania Trump, who is a model, comes from this certain background, you have Usha Vance who, in some ways, is like Michelle Obama, a high-flying lawyer who stepped down from her post to support her husband in this moment, but an equal partner. The Daily Beast had this piece that Usha Vance is about to transform into a Trumpian trad wife. I donât think thatâs true. I think that she might transform into a bit of a Michelle Obama.\n\nBen: I think a very relatable figure, I think to people like you and me, which is to say you can just see how much they hate elements of this and feel a bit trapped by it. Thereâs that old joke about the Secret Service caught somebody trying to climb over the White House, the security fence in the other direction.\n\nNayeema: Obama told a joke at the White House Correspondents Dinner. He said\n\nBarack Obama: That someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give Secret Service credit. They found Michelle, brought her back. Sheâs safe. Sheâs safe back at home now.\n\nBen: Yeah, I knew she had enough of that, which any normal person in that situation would have to be, I thought, pretty quite relatable.\n\nNayeema: Yes, and on that note, letâs take a quick break. I will stop talking about the women and weâre going to talk about the men, how Trump has taken over the manosphere. Weâre going to hear from Semafor reporter, Kadia Goba, who has been early on the story, deep in this world, and also hear from voices like Mike Tyson, Evan Elder, Lawrence Taylor, and other sports ball people.\n\nAll right. We discussed the assassination attempt, but we didnât discuss how it reverberated through the manosphere. Hereâs one clip from USC fighter, Evan Elder, who said this right after winning his fight at the ball arena in Denver.\n\nEvan Elder: Hey, I heard they just tried to whack my boy, Trump. Iâm glad that manâs okay. Long live Trump. Letâs go baby. Trump 2024.\n\nAnnouncer: Denver. Letâs hear for Evan Elder.\n\nNayeema: What a scene. Ben, do you watch the UFC?\n\nBen: No. I just watch what I think of as normal sports, but now they got all these newfangled sports.\n\nNayeema: But you do watch speeches from UFC CEO, Dana White, at the RNC. Heâs got that prime pre-Trump slot.\n\nBen: Yeah. The whole, and the aesthetics here are drawn from professional fighting, professional wrestling the first night, you have Donald Trump gets the second night walking down a long corridor with the camera receding behind him like a fighter entering the ring, and the last night of the convention is, right, itâs going to be really like the central aesthetics and the figures are from fighting. Itâs fascinating. Are you a UFC fan?\n\nNayeema: Ben, it will surprise you that I am not. Iâm not, but it was so controversial, I learned, and some of the research was episode that Senator John McCain, in 1996, billed it as human cockfighting, and then it led to the organization being shunned and regulated and censored, almost out of existence, until it was resuscitated by, do you know who?\n\nBen: I believe Ari Emmanuel?\n\nNayeema: No. Ari Emmanuel and Endeavor did, of course, acquire UFC, but actually before that, they could not get event programming, and it was Donald Trump, in 2001, that gave them an arena, the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.\n\nBen: Gosh, is that right? That, I genuinely didnât know that.\n\nNayeema: But they gained ground, in some way, partly thanks to Donald Trump, but also to reality TV, which that was not involving Donald Trump directly, but of course it was like a parallel universe to him where, in the 2000s, you all of a sudden had UFC fighters on these reality television shows during that boom period of The Apprentice, et cetera. So theyâre coming up together.\n\nBen: Did you feel like, at the time, you knew about this stuff or did you miss it? No, I\n\nNayeema: No, I was watching Americaâs Next Top Model, and I had this thing where I was too good for reality TV, except for the fashion ones.\n\nBen: A lot of stuff that you and I probably didnât watch, these turned out to be the central cultural forces in the United States and whatever we were paying attention to.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, it was also a bit of a counterculture. And so in that way, I think a lot of people were surprised when the first place that Donald Trump shows up after his conviction is at a UFC match, and thatâs where he launches his TikTok channel, et cetera. It seemed it was a newish news story, but actually, the shape of that relationship is really interesting because thinking about it, itâs this manly men being men thing that was too aggressive, too out there, and it got pushed underground for a little bit, and there was this backlash where it just actually found a huge amount of force, found huge audiences, and it rises back up again from the ashes with Donald Trump, who, of course, has his own thing going on. Heâs got his locker room chat. I think that they share an appeal to this broader backlash culture, this pendulum shift that people think has gone too far. And I just think thereâs something very similar in the kind of trajectories of these two worlds that struck me.\n\nBen: Yeah, itâs amazing you mentioned John McCain, of course, who was Trumpâs great nemesis and represented the last of the old traditions of the Republican Party, but he hated the UFC, and now you have this huge cultural force that I think people missed in the way that parts of the media really missed Trumpâs appeal in the first place. Youâre exactly right, itâs part of that same shift. Yeah, I wonder if weâre going to be, if weâre just all going to give us a few years, and itâs already a great media business, obviously, a huge business, but maybe what do you think? You think weâll be going to UFC fights in a year or two? Itâs just going to be so centrally part of the culture of Trumpâs America if he wins?\n\nNayeema: I donât know. I think it already is part, so centrally part of our culture. I donât know if weâll start going to them, but I think it represents the comeback, the comeback of men, right?\n\nBen: Yeah. You, obviously, have been following this one for a while. What turned you on to this story? When did you become obsessed with this story?\n\nNayeema: Itâs funny. I think I became obsessed with this story, not as a journalist, but as a woman in the dating world. Part of my reporting comes from this where I do think.\n\nBen: But you had to bring your whole self to work, as they say.\n\nNayeema: Bring your whole self to work. I started hearing it five or six years ago where women would start saying things like, âOh, donât you think men will find you intimidating?â And I think that it just gave me a sense that, oh, wow, we are in a different world where the conversations that were playing out in the political and media environments, conversations about Me Too, et cetera, weâre hitting home in peopleâs lives in a real way. All of a sudden you had men saying, âWell, how can I hit on a woman? How can I ask a girl out or kiss a girl?â And I think that they felt boundaried and caged, and I think women also were finding like, oh, how am I going to find a man thatâs strong enough for me? Thatâs where I became fascinated by this story. I donât know, Ben, if you think thatâs bizarre.\n\nBen: No, no. I guess these currents, then, always are the real things that are driving media and politics.\n\nNayeema: Yeah.\n\nBen: And I guess, I donât know, did you immediately see that in Donald Trump?\n\nNayeema: I didnât immediately see it, but I think early on in Me Too, it was around the time of Aziz Ansari, when Babe ran that story on Aziz Ansari. Do you remember that?\n\nBen: Thatâs a real deep cut, babe.net.\n\nNayeema: Babe.net. They ran that piece on Aziz Ansari, and there was this huge spectrum of Me too stories from Harvey Weinstein obviously being the one that is most clear cut, and obviously there was a release of womenâs fury when Donald Trump got elected. You saw it with the pussy hats and the Womenâs March, and then you saw it in the Me Too movement. And then when it came to that babe.net story of Aziz Ansari, where heâd gone on this date, it created a conversation in the culture where I think people were like, is this Me Too? Whatâs Me Too? And it created a sense that the world had moved too far.\n\nBen: Yeah, it was a sense, in a way, that the media had gone too far. That babe.net was doing a story on, what I think a lot of people saw as, a really awful date rather than as a crime.\n\nNayeema: Yeah.\n\nBen: And it felt that the media had transgressed into beyond our space, I think.\n\nNayeema: Exactly.\n\nBen: That is part of what thereâs a backlash to.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, it pushed people into the periphery. It made these conversations unacceptable in the mainstream, and so you see things like pick up the way you saw UFC pick up, and I think thereâs some kind of parallel thing to this. And then, of course, Dana White is the person that ends up buying the UFC. He ends up getting venues with Trump, making this deal with Ari Emmanuel, and UFC becomes much bigger than Endeavor.\n\nBen: But so I think you start to see these currents run together in 2016, these cultural currents, these political currents, these huge new media venture in the form of UFC, whose CEO in 2016, Dana White, endorses Donald Trump, and who winds up introducing him at the 2024 Republican National Convention. It really is this incredible convergence of all these different things that weâve been talking about.\n\nNayeema: And the convention, itself, just seems like, not just because youâre there, Ben, though, Iâm sure it helps, it just seems like the manliest place on earth. They even played the Manâs World on stage the other day.\n\nJames Brown: This is a manâs world.\n\nBen: Yeah, that was my second favorite. The best is a video theyâve been playing over and over, a super cut of a Donald Trump dancing to YMCA.\n\nNayeema: Is that manly? Is that strength doing the YMCA?\n\nBen: Yeah. Itâs a really interesting here because theyâre both trying to project this very specific idea of masculinity, but also trying to expand what youâre allowed to be like as a Republican, which thereâs a lot of basically secular culture, and itâs culture thatâs not about traditional values thatâs bleeding in, sometimes bothering some Republicans, actually.\n\nNayeema: But it is interesting because last week, we released a podcast about gender. We talked about the fight between traditional and modern gender roles for men and women as being the big story behind the 2024 election. We actually got some feedback that our episode was too heteronormative. Did you see that, Ben?\n\nBen: No, I totally missed that. But Iâm glad that thereâs still left wing media criticism out there.\n\nNayeema: But we talked about gender being the backbone of this election, and the next day, Axios obviously listening to our piece. Iâm kidding. But they ran a story calling this the Boys versus Girls Election. And in polls, Donald Trump is up, by some accounts, at 27% with men, and his lead in these six swing states is owed largely to men. And itâs not just white men, itâs also Hispanic men, black men, and there, Semafor reporter, Kadia Goba did a fascinating story.\n\nBen: Yeah, sheâs here with me in Milwaukee and letâs bring on to talk about it.\n\n[Music]\n\nNayeema: Hi Kadia, thanks for being here.\n\nKadia Goba: Hi. Thanks for having me.\n\nBen: Kadia, itâs been so long.\n\nNayeema: Kadia, I love this piece. As you know, I slacked you right after. I was jealous it wasnât in audio. And so now, finally, it is, youâre here. Explain when you learned that men, and particularly black men, were hot for Donald Trump.\n\nKadia: So itâs been a thing since the 80s or 90s, I just feel like people forgot that. And I guess setting out to do the piece, Iâve always had in the back of my head, youâre sadly mistaken if you think that he is not appealing to those people who featured him in his rap songs many years ago. I just thought it was something that never really was talked about during his last four years as presidency, and just wanted to explore that. But it never changed from the eighties. Heâs always been a figure in that community.\n\nBen: Yeah, I think this started, right, with you saying, âI think I can get an interview with Trump.â And in a way, for me, the beginning of this story was you saying, âI think I have a pitch to the Trump campaign to talk to him.â And it ended with you saying, âWell, the interview was interesting, but not that newsy, but oh my God, this was the most insane reporting experience.â And I wonder if you could just walk through that a little bit.\n\nKadia: So it started with this other story I had done about black outreach. I was just trying to get a story about black outreach. So from then, the campaign was like, anything you need, weâll help you out or whatever. And I came back to Ben, and Ben was like, âWell, you should probably ask him for an interview.â And I was like, âYou know what? I think I could, and I think we should probably make this pitch about me understanding Donald Trump, working at Dooney and Bourke back in the day, in early nineties.â\n\nNayeema: Explain what Dooney and Bourke is.\n\nKadia: Dooney and Bourke is a handbag store, and I used to work in their retail shop. They had one of Madison Avenue and the other one was on the second floor of Trump Tower 57. It still exists, to be honest, but it was a high-end handbag store. A lot of tourists would come in specifically for Trump Tower, but also come into the store. This is a long time ago. We used to smoke cigarettes in the back of the store at that point. But you would always see Donald Trump, that was never a big deal. You would also see him in clubs. If you were cute enough to get into those fancy clubs with rappers, you would see him in there. It was not a big deal.\n\nNayeema: Which, Kadia, you were cute enough to get into those fancy clubs with rappers.\n\nKadia: Well, yes.\n\nNayeema: Obviously, I presume. Well, so you had this really interesting vantage point to Donald Trump, not as a reporter, but as someone in the orbit, a fly on the wall or a Nora Ephron wallflower at the orgy, kind of. Is that right?\n\nKadia: Yeah, and to your point, I just never understood why people never looked at how rappers or people from New York never talk shit about him, or they just was like, oh, wow. Even Russell Simmons, I remember clearly him saying, âThatâs my man. I canât believe heâs President or heâs running for president.â But yeah, thatâs Donald, heâs cool. So I feel like people forgot about that Donald Trump.\n\nNayeema: I donât think they just forgot about it, I think there was this characterization of Trump in the tabloid culture and his attacks on the Central Park Five as him being intensely racist and understood as that, when, in fact, youâre saying he was part of the fabric of the community.\n\nKadia: Very much part of the fabric of the community. And on that, he talks about his op-ed during the Central Park Five time, and he talks about, well, everyone thought they were guilty, at that point, and he was, it appears he was just going with the, not defending him or whatever, but it was a different time. That really didnât become a thing until they were found not guilty. And then he was President, or at least running for President at the time. And then it was, oh, look at you, you racist. Whyâd you do that?\n\nNayeema: So bring it back to this moment when Ben says you came to him and were like, âOh, I think I get an interview.â You thought this was a bit of a good news story for Trump that no one was telling, his resonance in this community.\n\nKadia: Well certainly pay attention if you think that this group of people, Donald Trump appealed to a big group of people who voted for him, who thought they were underserved and not looked after or ignored, right? Guess what? A lot of people in the black community feel the same way. And because he has had this reputation, I wanted to dispel this myth that black people wouldnât be attractive to him, as stories or polling had showed that he was gaining black support, especially among black men, which brings me to my story because I interview a bunch of black men.\n\nBen: So tell the story. Basically, you set out to get an interview with Donald Trump.\n\nKadia: Yeah.\n\nBen: How does that work? Is that a normal process of trying to get an interview?\n\nKadia: No, not at all. I always felt like they were going to give it to me. I know people were probably skeptical about that, but I go out and Iâm like, so let me talk to Trump about his black outreach. And the campaign said, âWell, yeah, maybe weâll think about it. Well, why donât you just, first of all, you should probably talk to some people that he knew or he knows from that era.â And they were all New York celebrities. The first person I talked to was Darryl Strawberry, who was a iconic Met player. So that was the first person I talked to, which Trump and Darryl Strawberry, who puts those two together? But I set out to put those two together. These are some people who werenât very political, but had this appreciation for Donald Trump and wanted to talk about it.\n\nNayeema: And so youâre doing, youâre getting all these Trump surrogates in sports world, and this kinship emerges with these black athletes who feel like Donald Trump represents them in some way. And I think Mike Tyson summed it up to you best in your written reporting. We actually have an audio clip of your conversation with him.\n\nMike Tyson: If I ever saw Donald Trump and didnât know he was white, I would think that he was black the way they were treating him in the papers and in the press.\n\nNayeema: I would think he were black the way they were treating him. Is that a common thread? Does this community become strange bedfellows with Donald Trump because they have common cause of a fight against institutions like the press or the criminal justice system?\n\nKadia: Yeah, so as Iâm interviewing these people, Iâm also going to black conservative events and talking to just everyday workers or small business owners who are actually echoing the sentiment. So I didnât feel like they were so far off.\n\nNow about the criminal background thing. So to be clear, I have never heard a black man say, oh, I identify with him because heâs a criminal.\n\nNayeema: No, because heâs unfairly prosecuted by the criminal justice system.\n\nKadia: Because he says heâs unfairly prosecuted by the criminal justice system.\n\nNayeema: Youâre right.\n\nKadia: And yes, many black men feel like they have also been shafted by the criminal justice system, whether they couldnât afford a proper attorney or they just felt unfairly treated. So yeah, thereâs a lot of identity there. It does not resonate well when the white man running for president says that, but when you hear it from other black men, I imagine itâs probably more believable.\n\nBen: Also, you spoke to my childhood hero, a former New York Giants linebacker, Lawrence Taylor, number 56, and he said this.\n\nLawrence Taylor: Just he going to speak his mind that he doesnât care how it comes out. Heâs not derogatory, but I mean, he is, I like him. Heâs a manâs man. Yeah.\n\nBen: So what is he talking about? This manâs man line really stuck with me. What does that mean?\n\nKadia: Yeah, so I think in the black community or in the Hispanic community, people call him machismo or just showing strength, and that is something that resonates in the black community, whether youâre Lawrence Taylor and you make a lot of money or youâre just a young dude in the hood, if you have nothing, at the very least, you have strength. You can protect your family. It is something that is, I often hear a lot, and when I talk to a lot of people on the ground, black men on the ground, their sentiment was that the Democratic Party has really bolstered black women because Democrats famously say that black women saved the elections or voted Joe Biden, and they feel that they have been sidelined by that. And I remember one man telling me they already donât have respect for us, now weâre losing our women. So this is a common thread in this particular community, which is my community, I guess.\n\nNayeema: Your reporting journey in this piece culminates with you getting this interview with Donald Trump that you thought you could get, and you did get, and you asked him about his appeal with black men. And from what I read in the piece, he replies saying, âThey see what Iâve done and they see strength. They want strength, okay?â I wish I had his voice saying that because it probably sounds very different to mine, but talk about what he meant there. They see strength. They want strength because strength, that, itself, has this masculine quality and sales marketing to it, right?\n\nKadia: Yeah. Itâs that bravado, I keep saying, that appeals to the black community, that is something I think people from that generation feel like it has been either demonized or maybe watered down. When we talk about equal rights, I canât believe Iâm saying this, but yes, this is something that men, especially from that era, and are feeling and also teaching other younger men that this is probably not how it used to be and things should change.\n\nBen: Just to take this back to the media story that weâre thinking about and the media spectacle that you and I are here, in Milwaukee, witnessing. You came out of all this reporting out of this flood of 1980s athletes calling you, and Iâm curious here, as you see that Trump sell himself and sell himself through the media, do you see these threads? Do you see this case heâs making about gender, about masculinity?\n\nKadia: Well, sure, right. We see that when he talks about gender in sports and how a trans woman is not a woman, but also, since the shooting, a lot of whatâs resonating on the stage right now is talking about him being this, our bold President Trump, and he has a new mantra of fight, fight, fight. That is something some might see as a bit aggressive, canât wait until all this backlash happens in five years from now. But thereâs a lot of that. Thereâs a lot of hyper-masculinity, I think, coming forward. Itâll be interesting when I go back to the hill how this actually reshapes a lot of lawmakers and how they interact with us. But yeah, I do feel like I see it in front and center now.\n\nBen: You, in a way, weâre set out to write up a political story about his appeal and flickering in the polls to broaden his base among black voters. Here, weâve been talking about how there are UFC fighters all over the place, thereâs a lot of really broad shoulder guys showing up on that stage, and Iâm curious if you see, is that part of the same push? Are these different elements of his campaign?\n\nKadia: I do think so. Didnât we just hear that Hulk Hogan is introducing him or something. Thatâs insane, right?\n\nBen: Yeah. What is that about?\n\nKadia: Masculinity. You know what I mean? Playing into that, if you think about Danes telling me, which JD Vance could get lunch bucket Democrats, what is a lunch bucket Democrats, the guy that goes to the steel mill? It is romanticizing this bravado, and I think itâs going to continue and just going to be very interesting.\n\nBen: Got all the heroes of my youth here, Hulk Hogan, Lawrence Taylor. I have to revisit my whole political orientation.\n\nNayeema: Youâre in the right place there, in Milwaukee.\n\nKadia: Look at one of his spokespeople, like Steven Chung. Heâs a former UFC fighter, right?\n\nBen: Itâs an incredible career path.\n\nKadia: Yeah.\n\nBen: He thought you had a weird career, Kadia.\n\nKadia: Exactly.\n\nNayeema: Probably prepares you, like working at Dooney and Bourke prepares you for reporting on Trump. I think UFC probably prepares you for dealing with the press for him. Do you think heâs also appealing, that strength is also appealing to women? Because Ben and I were discussing last weekâs episode, the nostalgia, the aesthetic fantasy of this trad wife movement. Some people looking for more traditional gender roles, the challenge of finding men that are strong and protective. And the Cut recently had some polling that showed that Trump had about 21%, about a fifth of the vote from black women aged 18 to 34. Is that something that surprises you or?\n\nKadia: I donât know. So on my reporting this out, like I said, I was going to a bunch of conservative events, I wonât forget, a young woman stood up and said that she felt like she had diminished her man so much that she had to do some real introspective looks inside to regroup, and she stood up in front. It was at a cigar bar, and she stood up and made this testimony. So yeah, I guess this is part of that. It would be some really good reporting to actually hash that out, but I havenât. That stood out to me and matched the story I was doing for that day. But yeah, I would imagine thatâs probably, I donât know, how do you square that with equal pay and equal rights? I donât know how that happens.\n\nNayeema: Abortion.\n\nKadia: And abortion, agency over your own body, I donât know how that squares. I donât know if the country is ready to be that split. Itâs interesting, though. Itâs worth the threat of reporting, right?\n\nNayeema: Sounds like Kadiaâs next assignment.\n\nBen: Yeah. I think you tapped such a deep vein here. Really, really interesting. And I think itâs honestly, itâs so interesting to think about it. The other amazing status that Trump leads particularly far among divorced men, which makes complete sense. But can you just close this out here just with a reality check, Trumpâs going to get destroyed among black voters, isnât it?\n\nKadia: Yeah. So to be clear, the Democratic Party still has, polling is saying 80 something now, because the assumption is that heâs going to gain a bit of black voters. I do not see that. You know what? I am not going to make a call here.\n\nBen: But no predictions.\n\nKadia: No, no predictions. It would be interesting if that happened, but I would say black people, men and women, are going to overwhelmingly vote Democratic.\n\nBen: A marginal shift can change the election. But just to keep this all in context, it does feel like, I donât know, youâve just tapped into whatâs, I think, a really deep, long-term trend in America, whether or not it plays out in November. So anyway, thank you so much for this arduous reporting project of talking to every sports figure that I was obsessed with in the 80s. Weâre not going to discuss whether I asked you to get anybodyâs autograph, which would be profoundly unethical.\n\nNayeema: Oh God, Ben, LTâs? Was it LTâs?\n\nBen: No comment.\n\nNayeema: Well, thank you so much, Kadia for being here.\n\nBen: Thanks, Kadia.\n\nNayeema: Sheâs just great.\n\nBen: Yeah, I know, sheâs incredible journalist, and that was just one of the great insane reporting projects, just took every possible turn. Although, I donât think we came in thinking it was particularly a story about men, and it really became that. But really, through the comments of these guys who have known Trump for a long time, and I think the reason this was so relevant conversation is just look at the choices the Republican Partyâs making in how to present Trump and the crucial night of the convention that is really surrounded by these ultra masculine figures from the 80s, particularly, as Kadia noted, Hulk Hogan. Amazing.\n\nNayeema: Hulk Hogan. Well, it is a real moment in the manosphere for Donald Trump. And one thing thatâs been shocking to me in this election is how in recent weeks, months, itâs just been people who were closeted, Trump supporters, have been very comfortable coming out in places like Silicon Valley, especially as heâs moved on crypto. And Iâm curious if youâll see that in minority communities, as well, especially after this assassination attempt, more comfort coming out of the closet for Trump.\n\nBen: Yeah, people like to be with a winner and he looks like a winner right now. Thatâs probably the biggest factor of all.\n\nNayeema: Itâs because heâs manly you think he looks like a winner, Ben.\n\nBen: Because heâs winning.\n\nNayeema: All right, letâs take a quick break and we will be back with Blind Spots with Max Tani.\n\n[Music]\n\nNayeema: We are back and itâs raining men. Max Tani is here. Max, youâre in Milwaukee, which Ben has described as the happiest place on earth. Your take, are you happy?\n\nMax Tani: Itâs definitely got a calmer energy than I was expecting. I think in part because thereâs just so much positive political news out there for Trump, which is a weird thing to say a week when someone tried to assassinate him. But I think that the general mood here, on the ground, is giddy. Thereâs a lot less of the people singling out the media and saying, oh, these people are dishonest. Usually when you walk around these types of things, people will look at your badge and theyâll see that youâre press or whatever, something like that, and maybe some people make a little comment about one thing or another, but I havenât gotten that a single time, which is really strange, and itâs different than even when I was at a Trump rally in February and other recent instances. People here just feel like theyâre going to win. They have nothing to be angry about, from the mediaâs perspective.\n\nBen: Do you think weâre going to love them back if they, maybe, we know now that they love us?\n\nMax: Isnât JD Vanceâs whole thing built on the idea that the liberal media after Trump was just trying to figure out the Trump voter and to understand them and mythologizing them? I think weâve already done that, to a certain degree.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, there you go. There was a lot of backlash on that the first time around, but I think we are in a happy place. You become happier. Letâs see if it trickles into your reporting, Max, and you get deeply embedded with the religious right.\n\nBen: And it is true that JD Vance, right, is a media creation, in a lot of ways. The publishing industry and then Cable TV really just love that guy.\n\nNayeema: But Blind Spots this week, Max, I was actually like, should we even do Blind Spots this week? Because, itâs so, it seems like everybodyâs consuming all the news this week. The left and the right, there is a convergence in the story. The stories are so big, not the valence, but the stories are so big that you could be watching any channel and youâre talking about the same things.\n\nMax: That is a good point. People are paying a lot of attention to the news this week. You see that in the ratings for certain cable channels, you see that in the fact that people are just, generally, in your life, probably are just talking more about the news. So in some ways, yes, itâs an appropriate week not to do Blind Spots, but in other ways, weeks when there are big stories that dominate the headlines and that everybodyâs paying attention to, it means that there is a lot of other stuff thatâs still going on, but just people arenât necessarily paying that much attention.\n\nNayeema: So what are some of the stories weâre not seeing? What is the Blind Spot on the right, for example?\n\nMax: Yeah, the Blind Spot on the right this week is, strangely, Kim Gilfoyleâs, RNC speech. Now, let me say why that is. So, while other cable networks, like CNN, carried most of Gilfoyleâs Wednesday address on the RNC floor, Mediaite noted that Fox News actually cut away from the speech. Instead, opting to interview a dog in the audience.\n\nNayeema: They interviewed a dog?\n\nMax: So basically, as soon as Kim Gilfoyle, who is Donald Trump Jrâs fiance and a former Fox News anchor, as soon as she was introduced on stage, the network cut to a man on the street interview, and someone interviewed some delegates, and someone interviewed some delegates, and the man on the street interviewed some delegateâs dog. And instead of cutting back after that interview to the speech, they cut instead to an interview that Sean Hannity was doing with Eric Trump, which was interesting. And it was a pretty unsubtle snub of Gilfoyle who, for those who donât remember, was a host on Fox and was fired from Fox for inappropriate behavior.\n\nBen: Oh my God, thatâs right. I had forgotten.\n\nMax: Yeah, thatâs an old Fox scandal. It got a pretty interesting and fun dynamic thatâs playing out here, at the RNC this year, which is that youâve got all of these former Fox News personalities whoâve been fired, but continue to be important in the conservative media world and have some sway in Trump world, who are just wandering around and theyâre bumping into some of their former bosses. Tucker Carlson, who was fired from Fox more recently, was seen walking past Rupert Murdoch, and it was awkward for them. And so itâs one of these really interesting situations where itâs a little bit uncomfortable.\n\nNayeema: Itâs like a weird family reunion.\n\nMax: Yes, exactly.\n\nNayeema: Or there has been major divorces and scandal, et cetera.\n\nBen: The Republican Party is in this open and forgiving mood and trying to bring in the apostate. Itâs like Nikki Haley, but Fox, it sounds like, not so much.\n\nMax: Folks at Fox, some of them have long memories of old, theyâre not so great at letting go of grudges, for better and for worse. And also, once you leave the Fox family, I think itâs difficult to come back in. And one of the other interesting dynamics, and the last point I feel like Iâll make about this is, this is the best week of the year for Fox people. Every Fox personality, no matter how minor, is just completely mobbed. Everywhere you walk around here, theyâre all walking around with security and theyâre just like total rock stars. It would be like if Taylor Swift or I donât know, someone maybe moderately less famous was walking down the street to huge mobs.\n\nNayeema: And you guys donât need security there, Ben or Max, not one of youâ¦\n\nBen :No. Thatâs what itâs like for us in Sun Valley.\n\nNayeema: Is it?\n\nBen: Iâve never been to Sun Valley.\n\nNayeema: Oh, yeah. I like Sun Valley.\n\nMax: I will say I do. I have been stopped a few times, but itâs mostly by news PR people who are upset with me about one various thing or another, a story, usually.\n\nNayeema: They know how to hold a grudge. The other Blind Spot in the story, by the way, just for a second, is that Kimberly Gilfoyle, former, you said sheâs an ex Fox news host, current Donald Trump, Jr. girlfriend, also ex of Gavin Newsom.\n\nMax: Of course.\n\nBen: If we can get that guy onto the ticket, thatâll be a great storyline.\n\nNayeema: Iâm just saying, part of the trend of women moving to the right, I would say Kimberly Gilfoyle, right there. So tell us about the other Blind Spot, Max. What else are people not seeing?\n\nMax: Yeah, many people on the left this week likely were not watching the Charlie Kirk show on YouTube, and they can be forgiven for not doing so. In that case, they may have missed an interview that Turning Points USA founder, Charlie Kirk, did with Vivek Ramaswamy. Can we say heâs a friend of the pod or are we not supposed to say that?\n\nBen: Oh, for sure, for sure.\n\nMax: Yeah. Friend of the pod, Vivek Ramaswamy. And during that interview, the quote was, after the assassination attempt on Trump, âIf you are a man and you donât vote for Donald Trump, you are not a man.â And I think it gets at what you guys were talking about earlier, which is Donald Trumpâs deep appeal to men and the ways in which itâs dominating the entire RNC, down to the smallest YouTube media conservative media host.\n\nBen: Itâs so interesting because itâs the understory, right? Itâs not what political journalists spend their days writing about, even if it is what Nayeemaâs spends her days obsessing about, but-\n\nNayeema: It is. Iâve been early to this story, Iâm telling you.\n\nBen: Yeah, but donât you think that deep gender story so present here?\n\nNayeema: I think itâs not shocking at all to anyone whoâs in the dating world because you just see how the shifting gender roles have changed. And you see all these, a lot of people talk about this, but a lot of men who feel like they canât find partners, a lot of incel community. This has been a decades long story, and Donald Trump has just smartly tapped into it, I think, and they have found theyâre a fearless leader here.\n\nMax: The one thing that I think is also really interesting, too, from a media perspective is the way in which, and this is something I was wrong about. A few years ago when TP USA became something that was on the rise and Charlie Kirk had some money to start the organization, it was aimed at millennial conservatives and particular millennial conservative men. I laughed it off a little bit. I thought young people are always going to be much more liberal and theyâll follow the trend and become more conservative as they grow up. But I think Charlie Kirk and some of these people have actually proved us wrong in the sense that not only do you see in the polls that younger men are more receptive to the right, but also, itâs been a not unsuccessful media venture, and theyâve been able to build these media companies aimed at, essentially, young bros obsessed with the idea of masculinity.\n\nBen: Yeah, thereâs a whole space that runs from Ben Shapiro to Charlie Kirk to that Mogwarts Academy GQ wrote about recently for young men.\n\nNayeema: I feel itâs actually in the podcasting world. I, at the gym, will always ask dudes the podcast theyâre listening to when.\n\nBen: So in a way, this has been good for your dating life?\n\nNayeema: Usually someone talks to me and theyâre like, âOh, you do a podcast?â And Iâll ask them what podcast they listen to, and I tend to really not know many of the podcasts that theyâre listening to, and then check them out. And fascinating. Yesterday I was talking to somebody who was telling me about a podcast where they had just had a very similar conversation to ours about a woman had come on talking about the desire to go back to traditional gender roles.\n\nMax: I think the other interesting thing here is the etiquette around talking to people at the gym, and whether or not itâs youâre interrupting someoneâs workout. To me, I find it to be one of the most socially confusing places in the world because I like to have a completely solo experience, but sometimes I run into people, Iâm chatting, am I interrupting their workouts? Itâs interesting you feel, Nayeema, though, that?\n\nNayeema: I have a no approach. I would not talk to somebody at the gym unless I wanted to know how much longer theyâre going to be on a machine. But I will say that men do hit on women on the gym, at the gym. That does still happen.\n\nMax: Yes.\n\nNayeema: Maybe thereâs something about the masculinity of that environment where men will feel comfortable chatting to you in that environment.\n\nBen: And theyâre probably listening to podcasts just that are helping them game it out.\n\nNayeema: To like, bro, come on. Come on, girl, bro, itâs time to chat to that girl.\n\nMax: Well, youâre feeling pumped up. I donât know. Youâre feeling good about yourself, maybe. Maybe just added five pounds on the weight rack. I listened to mixed signals at the gym, actually. One of the last episodes I listened to it.\n\nNayeema: Thatâs clutch.\n\nBen: Our producers are losing it.\n\nNayeema: Iâm going to say weâre going to wrap right there, and got to hit the gym. Got to get hit on. Got to go, guys.\n\nThanks for listening to Mixed Signals from Semafor Media .

I benefited from the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at Ohio State University.\n\nI have lived a privileged life - growing up as the child of two college-educated parents in a wealthy, Cincinnati suburb. I worked hard in high school, taking all honors classes, achieving my Eagle Scout and getting a perfect score on the ACT. I attended The Ohio State University without a full-ride scholarship. The common misconception is that diversity, equity and inclusion programs took away opportunities from people like me.\n\nI am writing today to share that this is so far from the truth. Over my time at OSU, I had the pleasure to work, learn and interact with hundreds of distinguished students from a variety of backgrounds - many much different from my own. I learned about the experience of being judged when you enter a business because of your appearance. I learned about generational trauma.

It's time to eliminate it. | Your Turn\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion - better known as DEI - has been part of our national lexicon for decades. But in recent years DEI has dominated our political dialogue. No one has made that more clear than President Donald Trump, who has issued several executive orders that expressly roll back DEI initiatives within the federal government.\n\nThat move follows a trend we've seen in the public sector, where major American companies like Meta and Walmart have shifted their own policies amid an ongoing - and quite heated - political conversation.\n\nIt seems everyone has something to say on DEI these days ( our USA TODAY columnists certainly do ), but we wanted to hear directly from you.\n\nWe received hundreds of responses from across the country and all sides of the political spectrum, and we're sharing a collection of those with you below.

It isn't nearly enough, but in the absence of systems that actually prioritize finding the best possible candidates, simply pushing for a variety of candidates improves the average quality.\n\nI absolutely believe DEI has improved results across the board in all fields, though I'm not aware of specific examples that have been DEI-driven.\n\nI strongly oppose elimination of DEI initiatives in government and private companies. Until the government or those companies show any consideration for hiring quality candidates, the absolute bare minimum they can do is hire a variety of candidates.\n\nOnce DEI has become so ingrained that it doesn't need to be required, then - ideally - we can move to simply giving everyone the opportunities they deserve. But for the decades, if not centuries, left before we reach that point, DEI is a necessary stopgap.\n\n- David Ludwig, Covington, Washington\n\nDEI means that checking a list is more important than getting the right person in the position.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives force employers to make decisions not based on the betterment of their company but because of what some other people, not the process, see as needed.\n\nThis has affected my life because as a Caucasian man, I feel less sure when applying for a position because I know that I don't check any of the boxes companies are looking for. Also, I have seen coworkers fired because they have disagreed with a DEI hire.\n\nI support the elimination of DEI because we want the best qualified people in the right positions, no matter their race or gender. This should help raise the standards once again of the workplace and the quality of those companies.\n\nNothing should replace DEI. The less government interference, the better.\n\n- Edward McIntire, Monon, Indiana\n\nI will not be spending any of my hard-earned money at any place that does not have DEI practices in place. I worked for 51 years and I watched all my white counterparts advance and make more money than I did doing the same job. It was all right in those days because you could count on one hand the people who looked like me at the company.\n\nIn today's world, I don't even get the amount of Social Security payments I should be getting because of the small amount of earnings I made in those 51 years.\n\nIf I don't see someone who looks like me in an establishment, I will not spend my money there. That goes for retail, food services and any government entity. These folks want to divide us and make us feel like we don't exist in America. How do you explain to your great-grandchildren that they are seen as less than little white \"Betty\" or \"Bobby\" because they don't measure up due to the color of their skin?\n\nDivision is what you get today. And it will get worse. And then what will all the folks of white privilege say the cause is?\n\nYes, I will be selective where my money will be spent. All you hear is \"Make America Great Again.\" Well folks, America is great. It's just the narrow-minded folks who make it hard to stomach.\n\n- Stephany Walton, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nDEI makes a difference in that it singles out one group of people as \"the bad guys\" and the ones by whom all the problems in the world are caused. It does not seek to lift everyone up. Rather, it seeks to disenfranchise one group of people so that they have more advantages and feel better about themselves.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives had a negative effect on me. I believe I lost a position and was rejected for multiple other positions because I could not present the \"correct\" answer when asked about DEI during job interviews.\n\nI fully support removal of government and company DEI initiatives changes. True DEI happens best when it is organic and not forced. These are places of business, not social experiment and values factories. I worked at a place that had a DEI program, and it took the focus away from customer service and taking care of people.\n\nPeople will be who they are; let the forces of nature and society make those changes and let people make their own choices.\n\n- Scott Piepenburg, Williamsport, Pennsylvania\n\nDEI is America going the extra mile to live up to the American dream. It is an attempt to bring about equal outcomes for all segments of American society.\n\nAmerica has prospered for as long as it has because our diversity is our strength. Tapping the talents of all segments of our society strengthens and reinforces the matrix that is America. World War II examples include Navajo Code Talkers , second-generation Japanese American soldiers in Italy and the Tuskegee Airmen .\n\nThe anti-DEI campaign by President Donald Trump could well mark the final stage of the South's victory in the Civil War. That war was fought to keep African American slaves in their place. When their military efforts failed, the South resorted to other means: Black codes, the Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow laws, lynching, segregation, voter suppression, etc.\n\nI've got to give the South credit; they've never stopped fighting. And now with the help of northern racists such as Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk, they are on the verge of complete victory. Black Americans and other disadvantaged groups \" poisoning the blood of our country ,\" as Trump says, will finally be marginalized forever.\n\nThe anti-DEI campaign is racism pure and simple. Trump & Co. talk about a meritocracy while they cynically put charlatans such as Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in positions of immense power and importance. The anti-DEI campaign is all about marginalizing and persecuting minorities and trans people while cementing the power of Trump and his oligarchy of rich white men.\n\nI happen to be a white male, age 73. I had a 40-year career as a Defense Department civilian and I was, and remain, a supporter of DEI.\n\n- Thomas Gorman, Beavercreek, Ohio\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives mean that people will get hired for jobs even if they are not the most qualified. This policy has made it less safe to do many things in America because of cases where the most qualified person was not hired so a DEI quota could be met. It uses my tax dollars for implementing a bad policy.\n\nDEI has no business being involved in the hiring process for any company or government position. At its core, DEI is simply a form of racism or an unfair and inappropriate bias for one person over another to be selected.\n\nAn unfair and sometimes dangerous policy doesn't necessarily need to be replaced with anything. It simply needs to be canceled, so that the best, most qualified human can be selected for the position, without consideration of anything other than qualifications, skills, knowledge and ability to perform the task or job.\n\n- Terry Swant, Rockford, Iowa\n\nAs a 69-year-old retired attorney, I remember when it was known that white men were the preferred hires and that women and minorities were always let off first no matter what their background was. I remember in law firms where I was the only woman who was not a legal secretary. I remember over and over again when the partners were all white males except for one token white female, who was often interchanged with other white females.\n\nI remember in high school when women got no money for interschool sports because it was before Title IX. I remember never seeing a lawyer who was a woman or a person of color before I started law school in 1977. I remember when we studied the reasonable-man standard in law school before it was finally changed to the reasonable-person standard in the late 1970s. I guess before that there were no reasonable women in the law.\n\nDEI is only attempting to get non-white, non-male people a chance at the table when we had not gotten the chance before. Most people don't remember all this stuff, but it is quite vivid in my memory.\n\nI always knew they would much rather hire a straight, white male than me. I remembered getting paid significantly less than straight white males who had less experience than I did and knowing I just had to accept it.\n\nThere are good reasons for DEI measures: The wrongs have not been righted. Straight white men still have way more power - financially, legally, etc. - than their percentage in the U.S. population would indicate. And now we are going to go backward!\n\n- Susan Nicholson, Danville, California"

      "text": "NAACP: Replacing Black councilman with white man 'a step backward'\n\nThe Cincinnati NAACP issued a scathing rebuke of Cincinnati City Councilwoman Meeka Owens' decision to replace a Black gay man with a white, straight man on Cincinnati City Council.\n\nAnd that rebuke came on the heels of criticism by former Councilman Chris Seelbach, council's first openly gay member, that the selection of attorney Evan Nolan meant council has no representation from the LGBTQ community either.\n\nFormer Councilman Reggie Harris, who left for a job in the Biden administration , is Black and gay.\n\nThe decision by Owens , who is Black, flipped the nine-member council from a majority of Black members to a majority of white members. And now no member, for the first time since 2011, is a member of the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"The Cincinnati NAACP is deeply disappointed and profoundly disheartened by Councilwoman Meeka Owens' decision on the appointment to the vacant Cincinnati City Council seat,\" the Cincinnati NAACP wrote in a press release Tuesday morning. \"Her choice sends a harmful message - that the importance of Black representation, particularly Black male representation, can be easily disregarded.\"\n\n\"At a time when our nation is grappling with the legacies of institutional and systemic racism and striving for equity and inclusion, this decision is a step backward,\" the release went on to say. \"It dismisses racial equity and erases the contributions and presence of Black men in spaces where they are already underrepresented.\"\n\n\"What makes this even more concerning is that it comes from someone who, as a Black woman, has directly benefited from the very racial equity framework she now chooses to ignore. If she believes she hasn't benefited from these efforts, she is out of touch with the very processes that enabled her to walk through doors opened by the sacrifices of many others. By neglecting the principles of racial equity, Councilwoman Owens has reinforced the damaging notion that Black voices, experiences, and leadership are replaceable.\"\n\nCouncil now has five white members and four Black members. Of the four Black members, only one is male.\n\nOwens, after being contacted by The Enquirer, issued her own statement. She did not respond to the criticism.\n\nIn an emailed statement she said: \"My focus is getting the next member of council onboarded so that we can continue to focus on the important issues at hand. Division is the opposite of progress. When I'm not in city hall I'm focusing on electing Kamala Harris to be the first black woman as president, Sherrod Brown and other democrats.  We have serious work to do.\"\n\nHarris picked Owens to choose his replacement, a process laid out by the Cincinnati City Charter. Owens relied on a panel of community leaders to help interview the candidates, but in the end made the choice herself, she said.\n\nSix candidates made the s hortlist to replace Harris, Owens told the Enquirer. Three of them are Black; one is member of the LGBTQ community.\n\nOwens said earlier she purposely avoided \"identity politics\" when making the selection.\n\nNolan, 42, of Oakley, is an attorney. He comes to the job having previously worked in the Cincinnati Law Department and serving on the Oakley Community Council. Owens told the Enquirer she has a close relationship with Nolan and his ability to be ready on day one was important to her.\n\nNolan is set to be sworn in Thursday afternoon. Owens announced Nolan's appointment Friday morning at a press conference. He will finish Harris' term, which runs through the end of 2025.\n\nThe three other Black members of council, Vice Mayor Jan-Michele Lemon Kearney and council members Scotty Johnson and Victoria Parks did not attend the press conference.\n\nParks told The Enquirer Owens did not consult with her colleagues and wishes she had.\n\n\"I reached out to her several times and she came up with her own process,\" Parks said. \"It was her decision. She did what she thought was right.\""

      "text": "'We must break free': Ijeoma Oluo's 'Mediocre' book confronts white male power head on\n\n\"White male mediocrity seems to impact every aspect of our lives, and yet it only seems to be people who aren't white men who recognize the imbalance.\"\n\nThe words from author Ijeoma Oluo in her new book, \"Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America,\" out now, succinctly sum up the problems with a society that values white maleness above all others.\n\nThe book's title hearkens back to a plea by writer Sarah Hagi in 2015: \"Lord, give me the confidence of a mediocre white man.\"\n\nOluo isn't insinuating all white men are mediocre: \"What I'm saying is that white male mediocrity is a baseline, the dominant narrative, and that everything in our society is centered around preserving white male power regardless of while male skill or talent.\"\n\nSlavery and backlash to the Great Migration; the takeover of indigenous lands and genocide of Native Americans; modern-day politics across the political spectrum; higher education's racist roots and continuing struggle to deal with racism; and her own experiences with internet trolls, including the endangerment of her son , are just some of the examples the author of USA TODAY best-seller \"So You Want to Talk About Race\" (2018) invokes in the well-researched, yet highly personal, tome that shines a spotlight on modern-day racism and white supremacy.\n\nHere are some of the important points we took away from Oluo's new book:\n\nThough Oluo finds President Donald Trump's racist rhetoric abhorrent and problematic, she doesn't spare his political opponents. She takes President-elect Joe Biden to task for his flip-flopping stance on busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s, along with calling out Bernie Sanders' angry white male supporters, aka the Bernie Bros .\n\nBefore them, there were self-described liberal white men who infiltrated and co-opted social justice issues for their own means, including feminist activists Floyd Dell and Max Eastman.\n\nAnd since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, four progressive women of color dubbed \"The Squad,\" were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, they've faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike. \"In 2017, four confident, talented, unapologetic young women of color were elected to U.S. Congress, and everyone freaked the (expletive) out,\" she writes. They've \"been called everything from racists to terrorist sympathizers for daring to believe that their communities were worth representing and worth fighting for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, historically racist systems in higher education persist, and women and people of color continue to try to catch up to the head start white men were given through land-grant university funding and the GI bill that paid to send many of them to college following WWII. And when students of color seek equal treatment and opportunities, as they did when the University of Missouri football team united together in protest in 2015 , they are often villainized or penalized.\n\nThe same goes for professional athletes, including Colin Kaepernick , the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who the NFL blackballed after he knelt during the national anthem to raise awareness about police brutality and racial inequality. Primarily white team owners and managers \"preferred having less effective rosters over having to deal with the backlash of allowing Black protest,\" she writes.\n\nSystems based on promoting white male mediocrity are bad for white men, too, Oluo writes. The social construct of white aggression and dominance locks them into \"cycles of fear and violence - where the only success they are allowed comes at the expense of others, and the only feelings they are allowed to express are triumph or rage.\"\n\nBut Oluo is hopeful that though there are many historical inequities and current factors at play, there is a way to break the cycle.\n\n\"The path we are on right now is the same one that has brought us only death and despair for hundreds of years,\" Oluo writes. \"We must break free. We must start making better and more informed choices - with our votes, our wallets, our media, our societal expectations. \""

      "text": "Joe Biden: Racism is a 'white man's problem' that is institutional in the U.S.\n\nWASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden called out lawmakers and others Tuesday for not taking President Donald Trump to task over his rhetoric , saying institutional racism in the country is \"overwhelmingly a white man's problem visited on people of color.\"\n\n\"What presidents say matter ... They can make markets rise and fall. They can send people to war,'' Biden told a small group of reporters at a briefing Tuesday in Washington, D.C. \"They can, in fact, also appeal to the worst damn instincts of human nature.\"\n\nRace and racism have been major issues in the 2020 presidential campaign, particularly among the Democratic candidates. Criticizing Trump over his comments on race has been a central part of Biden's campaign, with the former vice president often referring to this presidential race as \"a battle for the soul\" of the country.\n\nAnd Biden has faced his own criticisms. Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who are both running for president, each had pointed exchanges with Biden during previous Democratic debates regarding his comments about working with segregationists in the Senate and previous comments on public school busing.\n\nStill, Biden has maintained frontrunner status in most national and early-state polling, and has benefitted from strong support among black voters .\n\nBlack voters are expected to be a key voting bloc in the 2020 presidential race, and Democratic candidates have been aggressively courting them, particularly in the early-voting state of South Carolina. Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus have endorsed Biden . Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, serves as co-chair of Biden's national campaign .\n\n\"I think people know me or at least they think they know me,'' Biden said Tuesday, adding \"warts and all.\"\n\nBiden said his campaign will focus its get-out-the-vote efforts on voters in black and Latino communities. That effort will include visits to states in the South and stops on the campuses of historically black colleges and universities .\n\nDuring the more than hour-long interview that focused on a range of issues, including criminal justice, voting rights and race, Biden said \"white folks are the reason why there's institutional racism.\"\n\nHe said there's always been racism in America, and white supremacists have long been here.\n\n\"They still exist,'' he said, noting he doesn't know what percentage among the white population. \"But it's real, it's there.\"\n\nBiden also stressed that \"silence is complicity\" when is comes to challenging Trump over his comments.\n\n\"The only way ... you deal with it is you attack it, you expose it, you embarrass ... You call them out,\" he said. \"Most of all, you call them out to our children.\"\n\nTrump's campaign defended the president's work.\n\n\"President Trump's policies have produced results for all Americans, regardless of region, race, or gender,'' Erin Perrine, a spokesperson for Trump's campaign, said in a statement. \"As a failing candidate continues his meteoric fall, Biden is grasping at paper straws to try and stay relevant. He can't attack President Trump on his policies so instead he goes to the oldest and saddest plays in the book. They didn't work for him in 1988 or 2008 and won't work now.\"\n\nTrump has also argued his rhetoric \"brings people together.\"\n\n\"I think we have toned it down,'' Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this month. \"We've been getting hit left and right from everybody.\"\n\nIf nominated, Biden said he would consider a woman or a candidate of color as his pick for vice president. But he said first that person must be someone he could \"completely thoroughly trust.\"\n\nBiden also said his campaign will ramp up get-out-the-vote efforts in the South and other places across the country.\n\nHe pledged if he's elected president he will beef up the Justice Department to enforce voting rights laws and block state efforts to suppress voter turnout, a key issue for voters of color.\n\nJohn Fritze contributed to this report."

Eric Swalwell declared in a tweet Tuesday as the 2020 presidential candidate tried to address the identity debate that has emerged within the Democratic Party .\n\nIn the tweet, the Democratic presidential contender from California pledged to select a female running mate and \"pass the mic\" in instances where he feels he \"can't speak to someone else's experience.\"\n\n\"I don't think anyone's identity should hold them back, but I think the next president should see all races, all identities,\" he said in a clip from an interview with MSNBC's \"All In\" that he included with his tweet. \"And I would put forward policies that would make sure that inherent bias that exists, or discrimination that exists, in communities would be eliminated.\"\n\nHe vowed to \"make sure that everyone, everywhere has opportunities.\"\n\nIn the MSNBC interview, which aired Monday , Swalwell was addressing a question from host Joy Reid, who said there was a \"lot of consternation among women\" who look at the field of 2020 candidates - which includes a number of women and minorities - and see \"the white guys are all polling up at the top.\"\n\nThe RealClearPolitics average of polls on the 2020 Democratic race currently shows former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders holding the top two spots, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Why does the field need yet another - to be blunt - another white guy?\" Reid asked.\n\nShe voiced a concern that has been expressed by a number of pundits who have questioned whether Democratic voters - who have not selected a white male presidential nominee for15 years - would be energized by a candidate who is not a woman or a minority.\n\nBut a recent poll from Monmouth University indicates those concerns may be unfounded. Eighty-seven percent of voters polled said that the race of the nominee does not matter; 77% said the same about gender.\n\n\"This is the most diverse field of presidential candidates in history, but that doesn't seem to be a major consideration for Democratic voters at this early stage of the campaign,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"It's probably a large reason why a couple of old white guys are leading the pack right now.\"\n\nIn the interview, Swalwell also said he is \"tough enough\" to defeat President Donald Trump if he secures the Democratic nomination.\n\nSwalwell said he would take on Trump \"without having to get into the mud\" on \"every single issue he wants to\" by acknowledging that Trump was right about people needing higher wages and lower health care costs. But he said he'll show that Trump has \"utterly failed\" to deliver on those things.\n\nSwalwell said that he could succeed where the president didn't without accepting Trump's arguments on issues like immigration or his warnings of encroaching socialism.\n\n\"I'm not going to take that bait and I think I can punch right back when I need to,\" he said.\n\nSwalwell also pledged to include Republicans in his Cabinet, but joked, \"We may have to send a search party out to find Republicans who will put country over party.\"\n\nContributing: Aamer Madhani and Deborah Barfield Berry"

At least three men, including the one filming, can be heard yelling at the man to put the gun down and stop. They also tell Gooch to get into her car to leave. She tells them to call the police.\n\nResponding Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officers arrested Mark Douglas White, 59, on preliminary charges of intimidation with a deadly weapon, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness, strangulation and battery in connection with the case. He remained jailed Wednesday afternoon and has his first court appearance Friday. Jail records indicate he lives in North Carolina.\n\nThe video that preceded the arrest Tuesday in Indianapolis was widely viewed on social media and ignited conversations about race in Indianapolis. As of 2 p.m. Wednesday, the Facebook video had racked up over 400 likes, 1,000 comments and 2,300 shares.\n\nGooch told police she was at a disabled gas pump when White pulled up behind her in his pickup and trailer and honked multiple times. She moved her car, got out of the vehicle and the two began arguing.\n\n\"I was sitting at the pump that wasn't even working and he pulled up telling me to move all aggressive,\" Gooch told IndyStar. \"I asked him what his problem was and he started calling me all types of n-words and threatening me ... Basically, I was at the pump too long for him.\"\n\nWhite told police Gooch pulled a gun on him, something she denies and was not seen by witnesses or police reviewing bystander footage during their investigation, according to a probable cause affidavit filed in White's arrest.\n\nGooch said she did have a firearm in her right pants pocket and when she was approached pulled it out and kept the handgun pointed down at her side. During the fight, Gooch put her firearm inside her vehicle.\n\n\"I didn't want to have to shoot him 'cause, I mean, look at him. He's an old man,\" Gooch said.\n\nOfficers arrived and were waved down by a witness who said a man and woman were arguing near the gas pumps. Officers found White and Gooch yelling at each other before telling them to both show their hands.\n\nThe officers saw White with a Smith and Wesson handgun in his right hand. He was told to drop the gun by officers and complied by placing it in the bed of his pickup before being handcuffed. Gooch told police she also had a gun, but that it was inside her car.\n\nShe also was handcuffed, and officers found a black handgun in a holster in the driver's seat of her car.\n\nWhite told officers Gooch exited her vehicle, approached him with a gun, and pointed a gun at him, a detail he later retracted, police noted. White also told police he then walked Gooch back to her car at gunpoint and threatened to \"blow her head off,\" according to court documents.\n\nDuring the incident, Gooch was struck several times, and officers observed marks on her neck and a scratch on the back of her head likely caused by the Smith and Wesson, according to the affidavit.\n\nMany on social media were criticizing Gooch for not just driving away from the gas station.\n\n\"I felt like if he wanted to shoot me, he would have just shot me,\" Gooch told IndyStar.\n\nIf things escalated to violence, Gooch said, she wanted to have witnesses, which might not be possible if she drove away and was followed.\n\n\"I have too much to live for and I'm not going to shoot somebody for calling me the n-word,\" Gooch said. \"I had witnesses and I wanted the police to come. He went to jail and that was what was supposed to happen. I'm just happy we're both still here.\"\n\nThe motivation behind White's actions wasn't clearly defined in the court records, but Gooch, along with many who have seen the video, fear racism is at its root.\n\n\"I (could) hear the hate in his voice,\" Gooch said.\n\nJosh Riddick with the Indiana Black Church Coalition said he hadn't seen the video, but between the recent erasure of government diversity, equity and inclusion roles, the pardoning of Capitol riot participants and the controversial salute by Elon Musk during President Donald Trump's second inauguration ceremony, bigotry is becoming more boldly normalized.\n\n\"There's a deep history of racism in Indiana with housing the KKK and that history isn't that distant,\" Riddick told IndyStar. \"Those people are still here and when you have legislators and leaders both national and local using some of the language that they do it influences people willing to cause everyday physical harm to minority groups.\"\n\nRiddick says that's compounded by the fact Indiana doesn't have strong hate crime laws.\n\nIndiana does have a law resulting from Senate Bill 198 , which was signed into law in 2019 by Governor Eric Holcomb. It allows judges to consider stricter sentences for someone who harms or intimidates a person based on a characteristic such as race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, national origin or disability.\n\n\"When certain ideology and rhetoric is enforced by this administration, it trickles down to the states and even further to the everyday person,\" Riddick said. \"It's certain narratives rooted in hate, and bigots then feel like they need to do this or act this way or take it upon themselves to address minorities like this in the name of the majority.\"\n\nDays before President Donald Trump's inauguration an Indianapolis man was arrested for threatening to shoot and kill \"illegals\" on Jan. 20. According to court documents, Preston Pickett, 58, posted to his TikTok that on the day of the inauguration, \"I will be famous for killing the most illegals in one day.. We the people will kill all you monkeys.\"\n\nJade Jackson is a Public Safety Reporter for the Indianapolis Star.

      "text": "Is it time to begin profiling white males?\n\nWhite men scare me. There, I said it.\n\nBased on my conversations with Latino and African-American friends, I think many of them feel the same way. If they're walking down a dark street at night and see three white men in their 20s walking toward them, they're thinking hate crime.\n\nAfter all, pick up a history book and look at what white males did to black slaves, American Indians, Chinese immigrants and Mexicans in the occupied Southwest. They're the original bad hombres.\n\nAnd so, after the Las Vegas massacre - where a 64-year-old white man named Stephen Paddock carried 23 guns into a hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and opened fire on an outdoor concert crowd, killing at least 59 people and wounding more than 520 others - it's fair to ask: \"Is it time for authorities to start profiling white males who purchase unusually large amounts of high-powered weapons and ammunition?\"\n\nYes, it is. And why not? There is plenty of evidence that law enforcement officers routinely profile African-Americans, Latinos and Muslim Americans. It's become part of police work.\n\nIn 1999, the New Jersey State Police admitted to pulling over African-American motorists more often than white drivers. In 2010, Arizona lawmakers codified ethnic profiling by requiring local police to determine the legal status of those suspected of being in the country illegally (read: Latinos).\n\nSo how did white men get to be so special that - in an era when so many mass shootings are linked to gunmen who fit that profile - it is still considered outrageous to say that this demographic merits extra scrutiny? Talk about white male privilege.\n\nGiven the carnage in Las Vegas, a lot of folks on both the right and the left are instinctively talking about guns. That's a circular, highly charged argument that goes nowhere.\n\nWhat we should be talking about is race. Not the race of the victims, but the race of the shooter.\n\nAuthorities insist that Paddock, who was reportedly wealthy, liked to gamble and had no known political or religious affiliations, fits none of the established profiles.\n\nBut actually, Paddock does fit one. He's a white male, and most serial killers and mass murderers are white males.\n\nFor the sake of public relations, and because - in the era of \"If you see something, say something\" - law enforcement doesn't want the public discounting anyone who might look suspicious just because of skin color, the FBI claims it's a myth to suggest \"serial killers are all white males.\" The agency insists serial killers span all racial groups.\n\nSure. But note that I said \"most,\" not \"all.\" The majority of mass murderers are white men. The fact that we might be able to find the occasional serial killer who is a woman of color does not significantly change the pie chart.\n\nBesides, the FBI would be more convincing if it practiced what it preached.\n\nIn 2002, federal agents were frantically searching for the so-called Beltway Sniper, who killed 10 people and wounded three more in the Washington metropolitan area. Authorities got off to a slow start because, according to the profile, serial killers are usually white men. Retired FBI profilers went on broadcast media and said, as one put it at the time, \"this is something white males do.\"\n\nThe shooters, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, were African-American.\n\nLike many Latinos, when I hear about a tragedy like the one in Las Vegas, I hold my breath and hope the culprit wasn't one of ours. My African-American and Muslim American friends do the same. I've even heard a religious conservative call into a radio show and say he does it, too. It's human nature.\n\nStill, I have to wonder if white men go through that exercise. I don't think so. That must be yet another ancillary benefit to being a white male.\n\nWell, the free pass has expired. It's time for law enforcement authorities to keep track of white men who stockpile guns.\n\nTo the profiled, I say: \"Put up with it. After all, President Trump called my Mexican immigrant grandfather - who came to the United States legally a hundred years ago - a criminal and a rapist, and I survived. I can help get you through this.\"\n\nAnd to those who think this whole concept is loony, and that - when it comes to who commits crimes - we can't make sweeping generalizations about whole groups of people based on prejudice, I say: \"Exactly. Now you're getting the idea.\"\n\nRuben Navarrette's email address is ruben@rubennavarrette.com."

      "text": "White man to stand trial for shooting Black teen who rang wrong door\n\nAn 86-year-old white man accused of shooting a Black teenager who mistakenly rang the wrong home's doorbell in Kansas City is set to face a jury trial.\n\nA Missouri judge ruled Tuesday that Andrew Lester is fit for trial for the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl, then 16. In an affidavit in September, Lester's attorney Steve Salmon requested a mental health examination following what he described as a \"marked reduction in Defendant's mental acuity.\" Salmon said Lester couldn't assist in his own defense in the criminal case.\n\nLester faces two felony counts of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. The judge's ruling Tuesday allowed the case to continue after a mental examination had been filed in court.\n\nIn a statement to the local television station FOX4 , Yarl's family said they were \"grateful that the trial against Andrew Lester is moving forward.\n\n\"This case represents more than just accountability - it's a step toward justice for the trauma Ralph and our family have endured simply because he rang the doorbell at the wrong home,\" the statement said. \"We remain committed to seeking fairness and ensuring that no other family has to face such pain due to the color of their skin.\"\n\nLester's attorney didn't respond to phone or email requests from USA TODAY.\n\nOn April 13, 2023, Yarl, a high school junior, went to pick up his younger twin brothers from their friend's house. He mistakenly rang the wrong doorbell.\n\nYarl told police he pressed the doorbell and waited outside the front door. The person inside took a long time to respond but opened the door holding a firearm. Yarl said he didn't pull on the door, and it was his first time coming to the home. No words were exchanged between the two.\n\nLester shot through the glass door, hitting Yarl in the forehead and right arm, according to police records. Yarl said he was immediately shot in the head, fell to the ground, and was shot again, in the arm, while on the ground. He soon got up and ran to nearby homes pleading for help.\n\nOfficers found Yarl in the street near Lester's home just before 10 p.m. Yarl had serious injuries but was in stable condition.\n\nPolice found Lester at his home, where the front storm glass door was shattered and blood on the front porch, driveway and street. Police found a revolver in his living room with two shell casings in the cylinder with live rounds remaining in the chamber.\n\nLester told police he had just laid down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring. He picked up his gun before responding to answer the door. He told police he saw a Black male, approximately 6 feet tall, pulling on the exterior door, which was locked. He said he thought someone was attempting to break into the home and shot twice within a few seconds.\n\nLester said he called 911. He saw Yarl's car in the driveway but saw no one else. He hadn't seen Yarl before. He told police he was \"scared to death\" because of Yarl's size and his own age, then 84.\n\nThe police statement said, \"Lester was visibly upset and repeatedly expressed concern for the victim.\"\n\nPolice booked Lester for charges of aggravated assault. But after consulting with local prosecutors, police released Lester just a few hours later, the detective's statement said.\n\nThe shooting renewed debate over self-defense laws in the U.S., especially as Lester's attorney has appeared to indicate he would argue Lester acted in self-defense, citing Missouri's \"stand your ground\" law .\n\nHigh-profile civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Lee Merritt, retained by Yarl's family, had criticized the police handling of the case. Lester was arrested again, after surrendering, on April 18, and released on a $200,000 bond.\n\nThere was an outcry to charge the case as a hate crime, but prosecutors never filed such charges.\n\nYarl's family had also filed a lawsuit against Lester and his homeowner's association over the shooting, though court records show the family voluntarily dismissed the case in October.\n\nYarl, now 18, \"suffered and sustained permanent injuries,\" the family's lawsuit had said. He also experienced disability and loss of normal activities and also had to spend large amounts of money for medical attention and suffered other losses and damages.\n\nThrough a GoFundMe , his family raised over $3.4 million to help with his medical bills and therapy, including for a traumatic brain injury. The GoFundMe, created by a woman identified as his aunt, said his goal was to study chemical engineering at Texas A&M University. His family described him as an accomplished musician who could play multiple instruments.\n\nOn Memorial Day in 2023 , a month after being shot in the head and arm, Yarl walked at a brain injury awareness event in Kansas City.\n\nN'Dea Yancey-Bragg and Thao Nguyen contributed to this report."

      "text": "White Man Calls Woman 'Fat Black B-' in Viral TikTok... Then Messes Around and Finds Out\n\nManage your account\n\nKarma was working overtime in the case of two white Alabama men after their racially insensitive interaction with three Black people went viral. Just a clip of the full altercation was caught on video and shared to TikTok, but after it began making rounds online, at least one man involved is facing consequences.\n\nWhat started as a debate over a parking spot quickly turned racially motivated and down right violent. Now, one of the men- later identified as Brent Jones- has reportedly lost his job after his bosses caught wind of the unbelievable exchange.\n\nAccording to one of the women involved, @livysotoxicccc on TikTok , she and her two friends- all Black- were sitting in their car when one of them accidentally spilled a drink on himself. Liv later took to TikTok to give her account on exactly what went down next.\n\n\"The parking spot next to us was empty, so we open his door. He swiping the ice out the car,\" she said. \"He mad as hell- he just talking to us.\" That's when a Mustang pulled up and began waiting for the man to close his door so they could take the empty parking spot. \"My friend closed the door just a little bit, and then the other boy- he got out the car,\" she continued.\n\nThe white man first approached the trio respectfully, @livysotoxicccc said before adding, \"We just came from church. Nobody finna touch these white people.\" The unnamed friend- who was still dealing with the spilled drink- was irritated over the mess, but according to @livysotoxicccc, the white men thought he was being aggressive towards them.\n\ntiktok-7482903913109228830\n\n\"The other man- the taller one- he got out [the Mustang]\" and began yelling at the three Black people, according to @livysotoxicccc. Eventually the argument between the two groups escalated when the Black man went to the trunk to presumably get a towel. \"'Pull the gun out the car!'\" @livysotoxicccc claims one of the white men began yelling at her friend. She insisted they didn't even have a gun, given that one of them was on probation at the time.\n\nAccording to her, one of the white men pushed her friend, prompting him to grab a \"black pole with a sharp end on it\" to defend himself. At that point, one of the white guys allegedly pulled out a pocket knife. \"It's like he was waiting to start something with somebody, and we ain't the ones,\" she continued.\n\nEventually, the two men began walking away, at the same time one of the friends began filming them. In the video, Jones, the taller white man wearing a white short, called one of the women a \"fat, Black, b***h.\" The another man wearing a green Champion shirt, Spencer Wooster, was seen on camera throwing up the middle finger at the trio. That's when @livysotoxicccc said she called the police and decided to press charges against the two white men. But that's not where the story ends...\n\ntiktok-7482804347554843935\n\nSince it was uploaded, the video has collected almost 560,000 views online. The altercation even caught the attention of Bill Penney Toyota, the company where Jones reportedly works, who released a statement. \"At Bill Penney Motor Co., we hold ourselves and our team members to the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and respect,\" the company said. \"After careful consideration, we want to clarify that Brent Jones is no longer an employee of our company.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Wooster has faced any consequences since the altercation.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram ."

      "text": "I Confronted A White Man In My Gym. What I Realized In That Moment Left Me Shaken.\n\nManage your account\n\n\"I'm drinking a $7 Brooklyn iced tea,\" the author writes.\n\nI recently looked around the YMCA in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, where I've worked out for over 10 years. I counted the number of Black people there, including me. Four. And 23 white folks.\n\nThese numbers used to be reversed. There'd be Black faces everywhere. Older folks with traces of a Southern accent greeted me: \"Good morning. How you feeling?\" The weight room boomed with Black voices - sports statistics and political opinion piled on top of each other.\n\nThese days, it's often quiet except for dropped weights and the hum of earbud music. It's a different place, but it's not about these changes as much as it is my reaction to them.\n\nI started questioning the relationship during the pandemic. One day I was on the StairMaster, doing my thing, when a Black gym employee approached a white guy on the treadmill in front of me and told him to pull his mask back up. He gave her a quick glance, slowly tugged the fabric, then returned his focus to running.\n\nThere was something about the look I saw him give her: entitlement. Dismissal. Invisibility. It triggered an overwhelming urge in me to wipe the smugness off his face.\n\nJust let that mask fall down again.\n\nIt wasn't even about him or the mask, I now realize, but about all the Black people who've disappeared.\n\nBed-Stuy in 2023 is a lot more expensive and a lot whiter than it used to be. Over the last 20 years, the Black population in the neighborhood dropped from 74.9% to 40.9%, and the white population went from 2.4% to 32.7%. It makes me wonder, where do people go when they're pushed out of neighborhoods they've lived in for generations? Where was Miss Beverly, the retired schoolteacher? Where were the Caribbean ladies who talked to themselves while looking at fruit in the grocery store?\n\nThoughts of these people being pushed out had simmered and percolated into deep resentments with no easy or obvious way to address or direct them. Instead, I got mad at people whose presence reflected the absence of those Black bodies.\n\nI was mad a lot.\n\nWhy are you asking if they have oat milk in a bodega, you dumbass, I caught myself thinking.\n\nDo you think I'm gonna move out of the way cause you're oblivious to the space you're taking up on the sidewalk (in the world)? Nah, bruh.\n\nI liked the anger. It provided access to what felt like a superpower, which began with a small flush in my chest and quickly spread to heat up the rest of my body. It was like doing drugs when you're an addict: You know how it's going to end, but you also know one hit will bring what feels like the strength to vanquish your fears for a little bit. That's what I was feeling in the gym.\n\nI looked at the man the gym employee had confronted just minutes ago. I saw the mask slide past his lower lip.\n\n\"Hey! Didn't she tell you to put your fucking mask on?\" I was somehow off the StairMaster, standing next to the man, and speaking at a volume I never used.\n\nThe author at the YMCA in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, New York.\n\nI expected, wanted, and needed an apology - for so much. Instead, I got a version of the glance he'd given the employee. I wasn't about to let it end like that, but then I saw past him to the mirror behind the treadmills. I looked crazy.\n\nHow did I become this person? I asked myself . Yeah, he's probably an asshole, but gyms are full of assholes. So what?\n\nThe difference is he was an asshole and a gentrifier, and I needed to separate myself from him and what he told me about myself.\n\nThey were at the gym, the markets and the cafes. I saw them because I was in those same spaces, sometimes one of the few Black people there. There was no Miss Beverly sitting across from me inside here, and it could feel like crossing a racial picket line to order a latte.\n\nI remember when an older Black woman joined me on the street as I was reading the outdoor menu of a new restaurant. \"Nice,\" she said. \"Too bad it's not for us people, right?\"\n\nI laughed along with her, trying to hide my embarrassment that I was excited to try the food. I felt like a sellout: a Black guy from a mostly white Massachusetts town still trying to straddle two lines of his identity.\n\nThere have always been light-skinned Blacks who passed for white, leaving parts of themselves behind for a lottery ticket promising a chance to breathe with ease. I was a lower-middle-class mocha-hued kid who couldn't pass, but I taught myself to code-switch and adapt to the rules of the class who ruled. I felt like I'd won that jackpot when eyes widened as people tried to reconcile my vocabulary with my Blackness ― and then my temples would throb. My need to win them over doused me in shame.\n\nWhy did I need their approval? Because though I'm an adult who writes and creates art about Blackness and bias, and though I've talked in front of hundreds of people about the subject, I'm also the child who slapped himself over and over in the mirror because of his big lips, and his wide nose he'd learned was ugly.\n\nAfter the treadmill interaction, I thought about another gym incident, also regarding a mask, a few months before. I was in the weight room when I heard, \"Hey, bro, can you put your mask over your nose?\"\n\nThe Black guy on the butterfly machine looked over at the white guy talking to him. \"Nah. I'm good,\" he said.\n\n\"Huh? You do know there's a pandemic, right?\" the white guy asked.\n\nNo response. The Black guy went back to pulling those bands and breathing heavily.\n\nNow you know what it's like to be ignored, I had thought at the time.\n\nIt escalated into an adrenaline-fueled argument, and a Black staffer was asked to intervene.\n\n\"Could you tell him to put his mask on? It's the fucking rule in the gym,\" the white guy said.\n\nI knew the conflict going on in the staff member's head: How can I side against another Black person in this space? They averted their eyes and walked away.\n\nI had barely talked to the other Black guy in all the years I'd seen him around, but now we looked at each other and slowly nodded.\n\nThe author walking in Bed-Stuy.\n\nWhy did I act like that then and now had a completely opposite reaction? It made no sense, except it did: The anger was also a deflection from all the ways I still prioritize whiteness.\n\nMy old therapist called it my \"New Yorker syndrome.\" I'd be on the subway, conscious of how my Blackness was being sized up as people entered the train and, upon seeing me, chose to sit elsewhere.\n\nI'd have the urge to reach in my bag for something to read - to convey my intelligence and relatability. I love to read The New Yorker, but in those moments, I'm using it as a shield to protect myself from the empty seat next to me, which serves as a reminder that my mere existence is a problem.\n\nIt's ingrained in us to prioritize the white gaze. When someone is arrested for a particularly bad crime, pretty much every Black person I know, regardless of their background, has the same response: \"Please don't let them be Black.\" But what many of us are also thinking is, \"Why are you making the rest of us look bad?\"\n\nIt's respectability politics, sure, but there's no way not to absorb the institutional, educational and political conditioning that's beaten into us - sometimes literally - from childhood. \"White is right\" is the default. Everybody else is a satellite orbiting a white sun, and displeasing or challenging white authority carries consequences.\n\nWhen my brother was in high school, a table of white students in the lunchroom called his table of Black friends \"niggers,\" which didn't go over well. Police were called after the fight, but only the Black students were spoken to. Because my brother was \"a good kid\" and the captain of the football team, there wasn't a mark on his record. He was told that people call the police \"pigs\" and they brush it off, so he should learn to ignore \"nigger.\"\n\n\"The difference,\" my brother told them, \"is you can take off your uniform, but I can't take off my color.\"\n\nMany Black people have been saved from punishment and consequences because they're \"one of the good ones.\" And many more have suffered because of their poverty, how they spoke, their education (or lack thereof), or how different their lives were from the accepted ways of existing.\n\nRespectability is a uniform I remove at night, alone in my bedroom. Only then do I realize how tight it is. I both exhale and stiffen, knowing I shouldn't get too comfortable, because I'll probably put it on again tomorrow.\n\nIt shows up in many parts of my life. Choosing the white guy over the Black one on Grindr, and telling myself his race had nothing to do with it. Making assumptions about another Black person based on how they speak. Taking out that issue of The New Yorker.\n\nI feel the warmth of anger following those moments, and it's looking for a place to land far away from me.\n\nWhy did he come back to check his lock when I walked into the locker room?\n\nYou do know I'm in between sets, right? How dare you come over here and change my weights like you don't see me.\n\nMicroaggressions are real, and my gym, the neighborhood, and the world are full of racial prejudices and assumptions encountered on a daily basis. It's about how I respond, both to them and to myself - no, my selves. There's the me who knows that nothing I do will change some people's perception of me. But there's also the me who desperately wants to win them over, even though many times I don't even know who \"they\" are.\n\nThe author with his neighbors, Sharon Drumgo (left) and Beverly Tyree. \"They've lived in Bed-Stuy their entire lives,\" he writes.\n\nRecently I was talking about all of this with my current therapist, who is Black, queer, and amazing. \"Have you ever considered replacing 'buts' with 'ands'?\" he asked. \"You're the only one telling yourself you have to fit into rigid categories of behavior and thoughts.\"\n\nSomething clicked when he said that. Yes, I push back against gentrification and displacement, and I eat in the ramen restaurant whose arrival means higher rents are coming. I'm a person who's never been in a physical fight, and sometimes my anger can be so overwhelming it feels volcanic. I'd love more than anything to date another Black man , and I'm scared of it at the same time, knowing they see all parts of me, including the parts I want to hide .\n\nNobody is completely binary. There are contradictions that can't be dismissed with a but . There's fear in knowing this: If I accept that about myself, then it's probably true of other people, and it's hard to let go of stereotypes.\n\nIn my work, I ask people to take a magnifying glass and look more closely at the ways we see each other, and the conditioning behind it. I realize I have to do the same - and it's uncomfortable as fuck.\n\nI'm rooting for everybody Black in a country that taught me winners rarely look like us. Embracing my Blackness means accepting that since enslavement, respectability could mean the difference between a body humbled and a body extinguished. It's part of my history, and the history of this country.\n\nI have more questions than answers. I do not know what the future of Bed-Stuy or of the people who live there - or no longer live there - will be. I don't know what my own future will be, or how I will show up or be understood in any given place on any given day. But I want to keep trying to make sense of it, and of myself. And the times when I root for myself exactly as I am today, without comparing myself to others, are beautiful.\n\nI have a fourth grade class photo on my bedroom wall. That's when my self-hatred was at its worst. I look at that boy with his big grin before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning. I tell him: \"I'm doing my best today to save us from doing more harm to ourselves.\" By \"us\" I mean me, but also my people.\n\nAt times, I still find myself questioning whose side I'm on. The answer is that I am, and always will be, on the side of the boy in the mirror, who internalized some hard truths about how he is seen on the outside - on the streets, in the world, and in the gym - and is trying to find peace on the inside as he makes his way in the world.\n\nDelano Burrowes is a Brooklyn-based writer and visual/performance artist who creates work about the double consciousness of identities.

(AP) - An 86-year-old Missouri man has died just days after pleading guilty to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl , a Black honor student who rang the white man's doorbell by mistake, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\n\nAndrew Lester of Kansas City was charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and is now a freshman at Texas A&M. Before his trial was scheduled to begin, he pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge of second-degree assault, which carries up to seven years behind bars. He was scheduled to be sentenced on March 7.\n\nCher Congour, a spokeswoman for the Clay County prosecutor's office, said Lester's attorney informed them of his death.\n\n\"We have learned of the passing of Andrew Lester and extend our sincere condolences to his family during this difficult time,\" the prosecutor's office said in a news release. \"While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr. Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case.\"\n\nThe news release offered no cause of death. Kansas City police said they weren't conducting a death investigation. And Sarah Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Clay County sheriff's office, said she had no information on Lester's cause of death since he wasn't in custody, but noted that he was in \"poor health\" at last week's plea hearing.\n\nYarl's family said in a written statement Wednesday that what happened was one of the reasons they had pushed for a speedy trial.\n\n\"Now, another Black child harmed by prejudice will never see the man who shot him face the full weight of the justice system. While Lester finally admitted guilt, it came at the very last moment-after two years of stalling. That delay leaves our family reeling,\" the statement said.\n\nThe case shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the U.S.\n\nYarl showed up on Lester's doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings.\n\nLester's attorney, Steve Salmon, had argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm.\n\nYarl testified at a hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed \"longer than normal.\" As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door, assuming he was at his brothers' friends' parents.\n\nHe said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, \"Don't come here ever again.\" Although the bullet didn't penetrate Yarl's brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later.\n\nHis family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they had filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic.\n\nSalmon said last year that Lester's physical and mental condition had deteriorated . He said Lester had heart issues, a broken hip and had been hospitalized. Lester also lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received.\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Lester was hunched over as he was wheeled into the courtroom, his hands folded. Asked whether he was in poor health, Lester responded yes.\n\nThe judge had previously ordered a mental evaluation of Lester but allowed for the trial to proceed after its completion. The results of that evaluation were not released publicly.\n\nLester's grandson, Daniel Ludwig, didn't immediately return a text message from The Associated Press seeking comment."

In an affidavit in September, Lester's attorney Steve Salmon requested a mental health examination following what he described as a \"marked reduction in Defendant's mental acuity.\" Salmon said Lester couldn't assist in his own defense in the criminal case.\n\nLester faces two felony counts of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. The judge's ruling Tuesday allowed the case to continue after a mental examination had been filed in court.\n\nIn a statement to the local television station FOX4 , Yarl's family said they were \"grateful that the trial against Andrew Lester is moving forward.\n\n\"This case represents more than just accountability - it's a step toward justice for the trauma Ralph and our family have endured simply because he rang the doorbell at the wrong home,\" the statement said. \"We remain committed to seeking fairness and ensuring that no other family has to face such pain due to the color of their skin.\"\n\nLester's attorney didn't respond to phone or email requests from USA TODAY.\n\nOn April 13, 2023, Yarl, a high school junior, went to pick up his younger twin brothers from their friend's house. He mistakenly rang the wrong doorbell.\n\nYarl told police he pressed the doorbell and waited outside the front door. The person inside took a long time to respond but opened the door holding a firearm. Yarl said he didn't pull on the door, and it was his first time coming to the home. No words were exchanged between the two.\n\nLester shot through the glass door, hitting Yarl in the forehead and right arm, according to police records. Yarl said he was immediately shot in the head, fell to the ground, and was shot again, in the arm, while on the ground. He soon got up and ran to nearby homes pleading for help.\n\nOfficers found Yarl in the street near Lester's home just before 10 p.m. Yarl had serious injuries but was in stable condition.\n\nPolice found Lester at his home, where the front storm glass door was shattered and blood on the front porch, driveway and street. Police found a revolver in his living room with two shell casings in the cylinder with live rounds remaining in the chamber.\n\nLester told police he had just laid down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring. He picked up his gun before responding to answer the door. He told police he saw a Black male, approximately 6 feet tall, pulling on the exterior door, which was locked. He said he thought someone was attempting to break into the home and shot twice within a few seconds.\n\nLester said he called 911. He saw Yarl's car in the driveway but saw no one else. He hadn't seen Yarl before. He told police he was \"scared to death\" because of Yarl's size and his own age, then 84.\n\nThe police statement said, \"Lester was visibly upset and repeatedly expressed concern for the victim.\"\n\nPolice booked Lester for charges of aggravated assault. But after consulting with local prosecutors, police released Lester just a few hours later, the detective's statement said.\n\nThe shooting renewed debate over self-defense laws in the U.S., especially as Lester's attorney has appeared to indicate he would argue Lester acted in self-defense, citing Missouri's \"stand your ground\" law .\n\nHigh-profile civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Lee Merritt, retained by Yarl's family, had criticized the police handling of the case. Lester was arrested again, after surrendering, on April 18, and released on a $200,000 bond.\n\nThere was an outcry to charge the case as a hate crime, but prosecutors never filed such charges.\n\nYarl's family had also filed a lawsuit against Lester and his homeowner's association over the shooting, though court records show the family voluntarily dismissed the case in October.\n\nYarl, now 18, \"suffered and sustained permanent injuries,\" the family's lawsuit had said. He also experienced disability and loss of normal activities and also had to spend large amounts of money for medical attention and suffered other losses and damages.\n\nThrough a GoFundMe , his family raised over $3.4 million to help with his medical bills and therapy, including for a traumatic brain injury. The GoFundMe, created by a woman identified as his aunt, said his goal was to study chemical engineering at Texas A&M University. His family described him as an accomplished musician who could play multiple instruments.\n\nOn Memorial Day in 2023 , a month after being shot in the head and arm, Yarl walked at a brain injury awareness event in Kansas City.\n\nN'Dea Yancey-Bragg and Thao Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: White man to stand trial in shooting of Ralph Yarl who rang wrong door"

      "text": "Opinion - Can Kamala make 'White Men for Harris' a real thing?\n\nManage your account\n\nVice President Harris's presidential campaign is putting money into reaching Black men. But she has a bigger problem than that.\n\nNamely, former President Donald Trump is winning a majority of men of all colors . Harris is 11 percentage points behind Trump with support from only 42 percent of American men.\n\nAmerica has never had a female president, not to mention a woman of color as president. Attracting more male voters of all colors is the real challenge for Harris, and the biggest pool of men is white men.\n\nYes, improving her standing with Black men is important. That is especially true in states that will be decided by thin margins and where turnout can be decisive. The same is true of Harris's need to gain support from Latino men.\n\nBut despite underperforming with Black and Latino men, according to several polls, Harris is still likely to win more than 80 percent of Black men and half of Hispanic men.\n\nThat is far from the case with white men, a much bigger chunk of voters in swing states and nationwide. Polls show that more than 60 percent of white men will vote for Trump.\n\nAnd white men without college degrees are the core of Trump's support in a Republican party that is more than 80 percent white .\n\nIn 2020, white men without a college degree made up 26 percent of Trump voters. Another 18 percent support for him came from white men with a college education.\n\nCurrently, whites without four-year college degrees, disproportionately males, are more than half of Republican voters. They comprise \"the single largest bloc within [Trump's party]...when looking at race, ethnicity and education together,\" according to a July report by Pew Research .\n\nJames Carville, the political strategist who led President Bill Clinton to victory in 1992 by winning over white working-class men, warned this year that Democrats risk being seen as the party of \" preachy females .\"\n\nTrump's every rally and rant is aimed to boost turnout among white men, with his alpha male praise of strongarmed dictators and threats to go after critics - \" the enemy within .\"\n\nAt the GOP convention, he gave prime time speaking slots to celebrities with white, male working-class followings, including musician Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan, the famous pro wrestler, who ripped off his shirt .\n\nHarris's outreach to white men is far less brutish. She let it be known that she owns a gun, and she drank a beer on set with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert.\n\nPart of the challenge for Harris in reaching white men is that President Biden, a white man, did not win the majority of white men in his winning 2020 campaign. In fact, no Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority of white voters overall since 1964.\n\nSince 2020, Biden has steadily tried to win over white men by playing up his working-class, white roots as a guy born in a blue-collar town, Scranton, Pennsylvania. Biden made history as the first president to join a picket line of striking workers in September 2023, when he stood with striking members of  the United Auto Workers.\n\nBut Sean O'Brien, the president of the white male-dominated Teamsters Union, said that 60 percent of his members support Trump. In a recent interview O'Brien chided Democrats: \"If 60 percent of our members don't support you....You need to fix it. Look in the mirror.\"\n\nWhite men looking in the mirror will discover that most of them are set to vote for a candidate convicted of fraud, ruled liable for sexual assault and known to lie about immigrants eating pets.\n\nIt could be they have a problem with women. Harris is winning a majority of all women voters - 56 percent, according to a New York Times poll , and about half of white women voters, according to some polls.\n\nThat gives her a 16-percentage point advantage with women voters of all colors over Trump, who has the support of only 40 percent of women\n\nTo reach men, Harris has recently appeared on shows with large male audiences, from Howard Stern to The Breakfast Club with \"Charlamagne tha god.\"\n\nOn The Breakfast Club, she refuted claims that she went after Black men as a prosecutor by heavily punishing marijuana offenses. She emphasized that public defenders considered her lenient for possession by non-violent people who were not drug dealers.\n\nLater, she demonstrated strength by handling tough questions from my colleague, Bret Baier, a white man, in a tense interview on Fox News. She needs to do more of that, confronting white men along the lines of a recent challenge issued by President Obama.\n\nObama bluntly confronted men who have unstated fear about having a woman as the nation's leader. Saying that he was \"speaking to men directly,\" Obama said he thinks men \"just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with...other reasons for that.\" Obama said low enthusiasm for Harris among men is \"more pronounced with the brothers [Black men].\"\n\nThat may be, but only because so many white men are not even considering voting for Harris.\n\nHarris needs to go on Joe Rogan's show and other platforms popular with white men. She must dare them, as she has said of Trump, to \"say it to my face.\"\n\nJuan Williams is an author and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "Kamala Harris team considers 'white man' VP for presidential run\n\nManage your account\n\nAllies of Kamala Harris are discussing the selection of a white man as her vice-president as support for her taking over as the party's presidential candidate grows.\n\nNames like governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky and North Carolina's Roy Cooper have been suggested as the fallout from Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance shows no signs of abating.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Biden provoked fresh concern by saying that he was the first \"black woman to serve with a black president\" in a radio interview .\n\nHe also made a confusing reference to there no longer being traffic on highways at an event celebrating the Fourth of July national holiday.\n\nA document reportedly written by unnamed \"senior operatives within Democratic political institutions\" has been circulating in Washington, according to CNN.\n\nTitled \"Unburdened by What Has Been: The Case for Kamala\" - it lays out the case for Vice-President Harris stepping into the breach.\n\n\"There's one path out of this mess, and it's Kamala.\n\n\" Kamala Harris has the strongest claim to Democratic legitimacy .\n\n\"She is the only candidate who can take the reins right now, instead of in late August with less than three months left to go.\"\n\nThe influential black Democratic congressman Jim Clyburn has said he would back Harris if Mr Biden were to stand down.\n\nHarris donors and backers of her nomination were reported to already be discussing potential vice-president picks.\n\nThe conversations were \"based on the usual notion that the country's prospective first black woman president would likely lean toward a white guy governor\", New York Magazine reported.\n\nBesides Mr Cooper and Mr Beshear, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania was also suggested.\n\nMr Beshear, 46, came to national recognition when he led Kentucky's response to catastrophic flooding in 2021. He is popular in a state that has sent two Republicans to the senate.\n\nLike Mr Beshear, Mr Cooper has won power in a traditionally red state and is seen as a moderate without the kind of political baggage that could make him vulnerable.\n\nMr Shapiro, 51, leads one of the pivotal states in November's election. He forged his reputation as Pennsylvania's attorney general when he orchestrated a $1 billion settlement with drug companies to pay for the opioid epidemic.\n\nA strong supporter of Israel, he pointedly showed up at Goldie's, a kosher restaurant which was facing calls for a boycott from pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nMs Harris's term as vice president has not been seen as a resounding success with her poll ratings often even worse than those of Mr Biden.\n\nBut a recent poll showed that she would fare better than potential rivals against Donald Trump - although she too lags behind the former president.\n\nCalifornia's governor Gavin Newsom, touted as one potential replacement, has been running what many describe as a shadow campaign,  while publicly proclaiming his loyalty to Mr Biden.\n\nBut California's reputation as a high-tax, crime-ridden state would make him vulnerable to Republican attacks.\n\nMs Harris has one key advantage over potential rivals in that she would have access to the $240 million war chest the Biden campaign has amassed. Rivals would have to start fund-raising from scratch amid wrangling over what to do with the funds.\n\nIt is believed she would poll well among women voters, with abortion emerging as a key election issue in November.\n\nVice-President Harris would also reverse the narrative on age, given that she is 19 years younger than Trump.\n\nShe is outpolling Trump among independents and moderates, according to CNN.\n\n\"Traditionally running mates are picked with an eye toward offsetting a nominee's weak spots and unifying the party after a nomination battle,\" Christopher Galdieri, the professor of politics at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire told The Telegraph.\n\n\"Should Kamala Harris become the Democratic nominee she'd do after four years as VP and four in the Senate, with an eye toward likely attacks from Trump as being a secret radical.\n\n\"She would also want to boost her chances in the crucial states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I would expect her to pick a white moderate who would be reassuring to those voters, much as Barack Obama did by picking Biden all those years ago.\"\n\nThe Trump team is sharpening attacks on Ms Harris, with the former president calling her \"Laffin' Kamala Harris\" and Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\"\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

      "text": "As a white man, DEI means I get passed over. It's time to eliminate it. | Your Turn\n\nManage your account\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion - better known as DEI - has been part of our national lexicon for decades. But in recent years DEI has dominated our political dialogue. No one has made that more clear than President Donald Trump, who has issued several executive orders that expressly roll back DEI initiatives within the federal government.\n\nThat move follows a trend we've seen in the public sector, where major American companies like Meta and Walmart have shifted their own policies amid an ongoing - and quite heated - political conversation.\n\nIt seems everyone has something to say on DEI these days ( our USA TODAY columnists certainly do ), but we wanted to hear directly from you.\n\nWe received hundreds of responses from across the country and all sides of the political spectrum, and we're sharing a collection of those with you below. Want to participate in our next Opinion Forum ? See what we're talking about at usatoday.com/opinion/forum . We look forward to you joining the conversation.\n\nTo me, diversity, equity and inclusion means making a deliberate effort to build a strong system of worthy candidates, instead of just settling for whoever is handed the job without working for it. Diversity means strength and adaptability.\n\nI think DEI makes a difference. It isn't nearly enough, but in the absence of systems that actually prioritize finding the best possible candidates, simply pushing for a variety of candidates improves the average quality.\n\nI absolutely believe DEI has improved results across the board in all fields, though I'm not aware of specific examples that have been DEI-driven.\n\nYour Turn: What are your thoughts on Trump's immigration plan and deportations? Tell us. | Opinion Forum\n\nYour Turn: Trump has been president for nearly a month. How do you think he's doing? | Opinion Forum\n\nI strongly oppose elimination of DEI initiatives in government and private companies. Until the government or those companies show any consideration for hiring quality candidates, the absolute bare minimum they can do is hire a variety of candidates.\n\nOnce DEI has become so ingrained that it doesn't need to be required, then - ideally - we can move to simply giving everyone the opportunities they deserve. But for the decades, if not centuries, left before we reach that point, DEI is a necessary stopgap.\n\n- David Ludwig, Covington, Washington\n\nDEI means that checking a list is more important than getting the right person in the position.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives force employers to make decisions not based on the betterment of their company but because of what some other people, not the process, see as needed.\n\nThis has affected my life because as a Caucasian man, I feel less sure when applying for a position because I know that I don't check any of the boxes companies are looking for. Also, I have seen coworkers fired because they have disagreed with a DEI hire.\n\nI support the elimination of DEI because we want the best qualified people in the right positions, no matter their race or gender. This should help raise the standards once again of the workplace and the quality of those companies.\n\nNothing should replace DEI. The less government interference, the better.\n\n- Edward McIntire, Monon, Indiana\n\nI will not be spending any of my hard-earned money at any place that does not have DEI practices in place. I worked for 51 years and I watched all my white counterparts advance and make more money than I did doing the same job. It was all right in those days because you could count on one hand the people who looked like me at the company.\n\nIn today's world, I don't even get the amount of Social Security payments I should be getting because of the small amount of earnings I made in those 51 years.\n\nIf I don't see someone who looks like me in an establishment, I will not spend my money there. That goes for retail, food services and any government entity. These folks want to divide us and make us feel like we don't exist in America. How do you explain to your great-grandchildren that they are seen as less than little white \"Betty\" or \"Bobby\" because they don't measure up due to the color of their skin?\n\nDivision is what you get today. And it will get worse. And then what will all the folks of white privilege say the cause is?\n\nYes, I will be selective where my money will be spent. All you hear is \"Make America Great Again.\" Well folks, America is great. It's just the narrow-minded folks who make it hard to stomach.\n\n- Stephany Walton, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nDEI makes a difference in that it singles out one group of people as \"the bad guys\" and the ones by whom all the problems in the world are caused. It does not seek to lift everyone up. Rather, it seeks to disenfranchise one group of people so that they have more advantages and feel better about themselves.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives had a negative effect on me. I believe I lost a position and was rejected for multiple other positions because I could not present the \"correct\" answer when asked about DEI during job interviews.\n\nI fully support removal of government and company DEI initiatives changes. True DEI happens best when it is organic and not forced. These are places of business, not social experiment and values factories. I worked at a place that had a DEI program, and it took the focus away from customer service and taking care of people.\n\nPeople will be who they are; let the forces of nature and society make those changes and let people make their own choices.\n\n- Scott Piepenburg, Williamsport, Pennsylvania\n\nDEI is America going the extra mile to live up to the American dream. It is an attempt to bring about equal outcomes for all segments of American society.\n\nAmerica has prospered for as long as it has because our diversity is our strength. Tapping the talents of all segments of our society strengthens and reinforces the matrix that is America. World War II examples include Navajo Code Talkers , second-generation Japanese American soldiers in Italy and the Tuskegee Airmen .\n\nDo you want to take part in our next Forum?

That war was fought to keep African American slaves in their place. When their military efforts failed, the South resorted to other means: Black codes, the Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow laws, lynching, segregation, voter suppression, etc.\n\nI've got to give the South credit; they've never stopped fighting. And now with the help of northern racists such as Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk, they are on the verge of complete victory. Black Americans and other disadvantaged groups \" poisoning the blood of our country ,\" as Trump says, will finally be marginalized forever.\n\nThe anti-DEI campaign is racism pure and simple. Trump & Co. talk about a meritocracy while they cynically put charlatans such as Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in positions of immense power and importance. The anti-DEI campaign is all about marginalizing and persecuting minorities and trans people while cementing the power of Trump and his oligarchy of rich white men.\n\nI happen to be a white male, age 73. I had a 40-year career as a Defense Department civilian and I was, and remain, a supporter of DEI.\n\n- Thomas Gorman, Beavercreek, Ohio\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives mean that people will get hired for jobs even if they are not the most qualified. This policy has made it less safe to do many things in America because of cases where the most qualified person was not hired so a DEI quota could be met. It uses my tax dollars for implementing a bad policy.\n\nDEI has no business being involved in the hiring process for any company or government position. At its core, DEI is simply a form of racism or an unfair and inappropriate bias for one person over another to be selected.\n\nAn unfair and sometimes dangerous policy doesn't necessarily need to be replaced with anything. It simply needs to be canceled, so that the best, most qualified human can be selected for the position, without consideration of anything other than qualifications, skills, knowledge and ability to perform the task or job.\n\n- Terry Swant, Rockford, Iowa\n\nAs a 69-year-old retired attorney, I remember when it was known that white men were the preferred hires and that women and minorities were always let off first no matter what their background was. I remember in law firms where I was the only woman who was not a legal secretary. I remember over and over again when the partners were all white males except for one token white female, who was often interchanged with other white females.\n\nI remember in high school when women got no money for interschool sports because it was before Title IX. I remember never seeing a lawyer who was a woman or a person of color before I started law school in 1977. I remember when we studied the reasonable-man standard in law school before it was finally changed to the reasonable-person standard in the late 1970s. I guess before that there were no reasonable women in the law.\n\nDEI is only attempting to get non-white, non-male people a chance at the table when we had not gotten the chance before. Most people don't remember all this stuff, but it is quite vivid in my memory.\n\nI always knew they would much rather hire a straight, white male than me. I remembered getting paid significantly less than straight white males who had less experience than I did and knowing I just had to accept it.\n\nThere are good reasons for DEI measures: The wrongs have not been righted. Straight white men still have way more power - financially, legally, etc. - than their percentage in the U.S. population would indicate. And now we are going to go backward!\n\n- Susan Nicholson, Danville, California\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA TODAY columnists and other writers on the Opinion front page , on X, formerly Twitter, @usatodayopinion and in our Opinion newsletter .\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: DEI is best when it's organic.

His aim is to imagine and point us to a better world. His last two books included \"How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia,\" a pseudo self-help manual which sardonically flagged the dubious steps necessary to advance in a crooked society. In his most recent novel, the masterful \"Exit West,\" Hamid humanized the increasingly urgent issue of global migration with a propulsive love story about a couple fleeing their devastated city for their lives. (It is currently being adapted into a movie for Netflix by Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions.)\n\nNow, in his audacious fifth novel, \"The Last White Man,\" Hamid tackles racism and tries to picture a post-racial world. The concept behind this allegory is provocative: All the white people in an unnamed country turn \"dark\" (Hamid's word) over the course of a few months. The transition period is rough for everyone, triggering dismay, paranoia, and violent flare-ups, but we're quickly assured that things eventually settle down into \"a kind of reprieve\" in which people were \"not visibly different, not obviously identified as being of one tribe rather than another.\"\n\nThe novel begins promisingly with an echo of Kafka's \"Metamorphosis\": \"One morning Anders, a white man, woke up to find he had turned a deep and undeniable brown.\" To say that Anders, a weight trainer at a local gym, is discomfited is to put it mildly. His racial prejudices erupt through every pore. Hamid writes: \"He was overtaken by emotion, not so much shock, or sorrow, though those things were there too, but above all the face replacing his filled him with anger, or rather, more than anger, an unexpected, murderous rage. He wanted to kill the colored man who confronted him here in his home.\"\n\nAnders calls in sick and stays home for days. His facial features, hair, and sense of self have changed along with his skin color. When he finally ventures out, he hides behind sunglasses, gloves, and a hoodie, even though he realizes the outfit is likely to make him appear more threatening to people who are still white. \"People who knew him no longer knew him,\" Hamid writes. He looked like \"not just another person, but a different kind of person, utterly different.\"\n\nIn an author's note that accompanied my advanced reading copy, Hamid traces this novel's beginnings to 9/11, which more directly prompted his second novel, \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist.\" \"I was 30 then and had lived 18 of my years in the West,\" he writes. \"I had always been a brown man with a Muslim name. That had not changed. And yet something had changed. I had lost something profound. But it took some time for me to understand what it was: I had lost my whiteness. Not that I had been truly white. But I had been white enough - as a relatively well-paid, university-educated inhabitant of cosmopolitan cities - to partake in many of the benefits of whiteness.\"\n\nHamid transmutes this altered sense of identity into \"The Last White Man.\" We're told early in the novel, before people start to transition in greater numbers, that his protagonist notices others' whiteness in a new way and feels vaguely menaced, with \"a kind of strumming anxiety.\" But apart from his initial reaction, Anders' responses to the situation feel muted, even when, upon his return to work, his boss, who has no idea of what lies ahead, says, \"I would have killed myself. ... If it was me.\"\n\nWhat should be a riveting, incendiary tale fails to spark much tension save in a few scenes - or to match the power of Hamid's author's note. Anders' girlfriend, Oona, a yoga instructor, who is already feeling emotionally tapped out after the recent death of her twin brother and the strain of caring for her unhinged mother, doesn't enliven matters with her own subdued reactions.\n\nEventually, other people start turning dark, and Anders has trouble distinguishing between those who were always dark versus those who have recently turned. He wonders whether \"people who had been born dark could tell the difference.\" When violence erupts, with armed right-wing militants patrolling the streets and running dark people out of town, Anders hides out in his dying father's house.\n\nMy summary makes this sound more gripping than it is. Despite its provocative premise, the novel is oddly flat. In his attempt to lend universality to his fable, Hamid has avoided particulars. Anders and Oona, the only named characters, lack passion and verve. Ironically, the unnamed characters, like Oona's mother, who feeds on right-wing, racist conspiracy theories and later admits to nostalgia for \"the whiteness that could no longer be seen but was still a part of them,\" are more vivid.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But if you'd consider being radically inclusive for a moment, I'd like to give a shoutout to some white men this year. This is a necessary exception because the continued segregation of white and Black Americans' shared history on Native American land is robbing all Americans of a comprehensive telling of our past, creating lots of misinformation in our present, and threatening our hopes for a more united tomorrow.\n\nThis lack of historical integration limits our knowledge of each other and creates fears and divisions that truth and proximity can help us heal.\n\nOne week after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, two white men from Pennsylvania wanted to see things change. They decided that change would start with them. Kevin Eppler and Jay Coen Gilbert gathered more than 100 white men from across the country for a video conference about how they could learn to have a role in dismantling racism and the culture and systems of white supremacy that reside within themselves, their communities, and their country.\n\nA Black History Month article about white men? Yes. This group works to recognize and correct the stories - and systems - that perpetuate racism, including those that have benefited them.\n\nThat kicked off White Men for Racial Justice (WMRJ), a brave space for white men to unlearn misconceptions and prejudices and to learn ways to show up in multicultural spaces with skills that could help them engage within and across racial lines using curiosity, not judgment.\n\nIn 1946, physicist and Nobel laureate Albert Einstein, who was also a member of the NAACP , spoke at Lincoln University, a historically Black college. As Isabel Wilkerson records in her book \"Caste: The Origins of our Discontents,\" he said, \"The separation of the races is not a disease of the colored people, but a disease of the white people.\" WMRJ is addressing this long-standing need that has plagued our society.\n\n\"For many white men, our first instinct is to say, 'I'm not a racist,'\" says Mr. Eppler, \"but we don't know what we don't know. ... We assume and accept many things in our society as normal. ... There's so much we don't question.\"\n\nA graduate of Harvard Divinity School, Mr. Eppler has studied extensively the intersection of religion and social justice and has worked as a curriculum designer for organizations wanting to build racial and cultural competency within their workplaces. \"I know Black, Latin American, and feminist liberation theologies, but I had never examined myself critically,\" he says. \"I had never asked myself the ways I could be carrying around a white supremacist's mindset. ... I was unaware of the cultural influence white supremacy had on me.\"\n\nMr. Eppler; Mr. Gilbert, co-chair of the business-led change network Imperative 21 ; and dozens of volunteers offer online training sessions, online and in-person peer circles, and immersion weekends that focus on issues of racial justice. During these programs, white men share perspectives they've long held, ask questions they've felt they couldn't ask, and practice skills that can help them have more constructive conversations about racial issues with white people and people of color.\n\n\"Our workplaces and communities are more diverse,\" says Mr. Eppler, who grew up on the white side of Baltimore and now lives in a racially diverse community. \"Racial justice, equity, and diversity are part of today's conversations. ... Many white men worry about saying the wrong thing.\"\n\nCentral to WMRJ's program is a practice from liberation theology that calls for reflection on the world's structures and the ways those structures might be oppressive. \"Our actions must be informed by deep reflection,\" says Mr. Eppler. \"At WMRJ, that looks like a continuous cycle of reflection that leads to action, that leads to reflection on that action that influences the next action.\"\n\nProviding opportunities to participate in informed action is part of WMRJ's mission. Its members are assigned to peer circles based on their geographic location, allowing the men to work as a group on racial justice issues in their area. \"We've had men go to school board meetings to support the teaching of a more complete racial history of our country,\" says Mr. Eppler. \"We've funded and participated in a conference on racial reparations, encouraging our churches, synagogues, and meetinghouses to come, learn, and participate in the discussion. In another location, some men are involved in a city's gun violence conversations. Issues of race were being discussed and immigrant populations were becoming a target.\"\n\nWMRJ's curriculum includes works from African American, Native American, and Australian Aboriginal writers and educators. Staffed by volunteers, WMRJ pays its equity advisers, Black professionals who collaborate on the curriculum and help facilitate workshops and weekend immersion experiences. \"They challenge us so that we don't become a book club,\" says Mr. Eppler. \"It's not just learning about voter suppression; it's also what are we doing to fight against it.\"\n\nWMRJ has received some pushback for being a group exclusively for white men, but as Mr. Eppler explains, \"We have to do our own work.\" Often the lone white man at workshops about racial justice, he notes, \"One of the advantages of our program is that we don't have to get everything right in this space. Here we can wrestle with our perspectives alongside others who are wrestling. We hear statistics and can look at evidence that doesn't feed into narratives we've long held on to. ... Why hadn't I learned about redlining , ...why didn't I know that the GI Bill that my grandfather and my father received was systemically denied to Black veterans?\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nClosing in on its third year, WMRJ has garnered more than 400 men into its ongoing community of practice. \"We're not giving out certificates or degrees,\" says Mr. Eppler. \"The work of racial justice is lifelong work. And it's work that leads to joy. That's not a word commonly used to describe working on issues of racial justice, but it's the joy that comes from authentic relationships, ... from learning new ways to relate to people, ... from being able to laugh at ourselves, ... from telling our stories without being judged.\"\n\nFor me, at least this year, Black History Month is not only the recognition of Black achievement. It's also an acknowledgment of those who are working to end the segregated telling of America's history that makes Black History Month a necessity.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Grutman and Gay Matthaei; Thomasson-Grant Inc., 72 pp., $17.95\n\nFOR an eight-year-old Sioux Indian boy named Blue Eagle, his whole life centered on Two Painted Horse, a pony given to him by his father.\n\n``Two Painted Horse was my very best friend,'' says Blue Eagle in a colorful ledgerbook written and drawn to resemble the Indian ledgerbooks of the late 1800s.\n\n``The Ledgerbook of Thomas Blue Eagle'' is fiction, but the story is typical of the experiences an Indian boy might have had in those days. And the drawings are simple, energetic, and direct - just like a real ledgerbook.\n\nBefore the arrival of the white man in the plains area of North America, Indians did not have written languages or paper. Many of their drawings were either scratched on canyon walls or painted on buffalo hide. Stories were told around campfires.\n\nBut the white man brought ledgerbooks. These are vertical books with lined pages and columns for keeping records of money transactions. Many Indians used the books for drawing pictures of their horses, battles, and daily life.\n\nIn this ledgerbook, Thomas Blue Eagle lives in a tribe that hunts buffalo for all their needs. ``We were the people of the buffalo,'' says Blue Eagle as he rides his horse and lives in a tepee made of buffalo hide. His tribe follows the buffalo herds, moving with them as the seasons change.\n\nIndians find a spiritual connection to the outdoors, and to the ways they are provided with food, water, and animals. Indians also think dreams are important and learn from them.\n\nAfter escaping from an attack on his tribe by Crow Indians, Blue Eagle has a vision (a sudden insight or clarity) in which he thinks he is an eagle. Eventually, he returns to his family as Thomas Blue Eagle.\n\n``All our eyes were wet with happiness and my heart was full of thankfulness,'' he says when he is back with his family.\n\nBut as more and more white men come across the plains in covered wagons, most of the buffalos are killed, and the land is taken from the Indians in wars and battles.\n\nBlue Eagle's father agrees to have him sent to a school in Carlisle, Pa., where young Indians are taught to read and write English. But the real purpose of the school was to completely change Indians, to make them just like the white man, because at the time Indians were thought to be inferior. At the school, ``Thomas'' is added to Blue Eagle's name.\n\nBlue Eagle's braids are cut; he no longer wears Indian clothing but must wear a dark-blue uniform and shoes. He is forbidden to speak his Indian language. He misses Two Painted Horse, but is allowed to keep a single Indian item, his parfleche, a container made from buffalo hide.\n\nThe real Carlisle Indian School existed from 1879 to 1918. For most young Indians it was a grim and mean environment. They were cut off from their Indian ways and treated harshly.\n\nEven though the teachers and officials thought they were doing what was best for the Indians, many Indians died there.\n\nIn the ledgerbook, Blue Eagle stays for six years. He plays football, learns how to use tools, and learns to read and write. One night he has a knife fight with a rival Indian, but is healed of a wound using Indian ways.\n\nBefore he goes home to Two Painted Horse, he writes, ``I have learned the white man's ways, as my father wished.... I have also learned that the white man does not see with the eyes in his heart.'' `Kidspace' is a place on The Home Forum pages where kids can find stories that will spark imaginations, entertain with a tall tale, explain how things work, or describe a real-life event.

Log in to hide ads .\n\nThe past year has heightened revelations and discussions about race and white privilege in the U.S. - yet many white Americans  remain reluctant to have those conversations, or struggle to talk about race-related issues.\n\nLoading...\n\nMarch 26, 2021, 12:18 p.m. ET\n\nJohn Bost seems precisely the kind of person that his fellow Americans could have a conversation with - politically moderate, neither an Obama voter nor a Trump one, willing to engage with those both more liberal and more conservative than he is, the former mayor of the North Carolina town where he has lived for more than a quarter century.\n\nTrouble is, when it comes to talking about race with other white people, when it comes to that conversation, the talks he tries to have often lead to the exact same place: absolutely nowhere.\n\n\"They try to compliment you. But I read between the lines. They say, 'You're a deep thinker,'\" Mr. Bost, of Clemmons, North Carolina, says, laughing. \"After a while, they just don't show up as much.\"\n\nThe conversation. The one about race. The one about whiteness and what it means in a multiracial society that is 150 years out of slavery but still reverberating with racial horror. The 21st-century conversation that seems more relevant than ever, yet the one many white people simply don't have, or don't want to have.\n\nAs pervasive and perpetual a subject as race is and has been in the United States - a reality that revealed itself even more starkly over the past year - the conversation about it has been a lopsided one. Most of the talking, protesting, and calling for change has come from people of color.\n\n\"We have all these other ways to not talk about race and white supremacy and white nationalism,\" says the Rev. Jason Chesnut, a minister in Vancouver, Washington, who is white.\n\nCall it the \"fish don't know they're in water\" perspective: As the largest, dominant group in the United States, assuming the position of the \"norm,\" white people generally have not identified with having an everyday collective racial identity like Black, Asian American, Native, and Latino communities.\n\nAnd yet, those who research it say, whiteness - and a commitment to it, however conscious - is as present as the air.\n\n\"For a long time, it was very easy for white people to sort of ignore race, because they could take their racial group for granted, and especially in an environment where they didn't perceive a lot of threats to their group and its status,\" said Ashley Jardina, an assistant professor of political science at Duke University who researches white identity politics.\n\nS. Michael Gaddis, an assistant professor of sociology at UCLA, says research shows that for many white people, \"their views on race are still in an era where race is something we should not be talking about.\"\n\nThe day of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in January proved an apt case study for looking at this issue.\n\nThe racial makeup of the Jan. 6 insurrection was hard to miss - a predominantly white crowd of rioters, including some with connections to white nationalist and extremist groups, violently disrupting the certification of the presidential election and running unhindered through the Capitol, a symbol of American democracy.\n\nThe lax policing, a contrast to the strong law enforcement presence seen last summer during protests over the police killings of Black men and women, was swiftly pointed out as a racial double standard, and the presence of current or former military or law enforcement among the rioters sparked concern over extremism in military ranks.\n\nBut the entire crowd wasn't law enforcement, or flag-waving extremist militia. Far from it. They were also regular, everyday white people - small business owners, students, employees - who were ready to overturn an election because they thought their candidate needed to stay in office.\n\nThat's something white Americans must wrestle with, as Mr. Chesnut sees it. Trouble is, he's not particularly optimistic, based on his experience doing anti-racist work. Most white people he meets are surprised that a white man would even talk about race as much as he does.\n\n\"I don't know if white people have learned how to be in a multiracial democracy,\" Mr. Chesnut says. \"White supremacy is destroying us, too, and I don't think we talk enough about that.\"\n\nOr about much having to do with whiteness. In 2019, a Pew Research Center survey found that just 15% of white people considered being white either extremely or very important to how they think about themselves. That compares to 74% of Black people, 59% of Hispanic people, and 56% of Asian people. The number of white people who considered their race extremely important to their self-image was just 5%.\n\nLaurissa Steadman, a conservative and a Trump supporter, says it's easier for white Americans who are liberal to speak about their politics than it is for white conservatives. She says white conservatives like her are often accused of being racist.\n\nMs. Steadman, from California's San Francisco Bay Area, doesn't see race in what happened at the Capitol. She says it was an expression of political frustration, and that the supremacist presence was a small fringe that does not represent conservatives.\n\nBut she acknowledges the criticism that white conservatives face by not being willing to have a conversation about race.\n\n\"I believe there will be assumptions made about them, and their voices will not be heard and the assumptions will be the narrative,\" she says.\n\nHigh-profile events driven by racists also impede conversation. When white Americans have emphasized their racial identity in ways viewed as threatening - such as during the Capitol insurrection or the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia - it makes white people in general more reluctant to acknowledge white as their racial identifier, Ms. Jardina says.\n\n\"The more we associate people storming the Capitol and waving Confederate flags with white identity and white supremacy, with a capital W and a capital S, the more we'll find that many white Americans are going to back away from this,\" she says.\n\nThat avoidance is precisely the problem, says the Rev. Susan Chorley, a Boston-area pastor.\n\n\"This mess has been from the founding of this country. This mess has been in our soil. It's in our soul,\" Ms. Chorley says. \"It's everywhere, and we've never really completely decided that we will look at it.\"\n\nIf white people want the future to be different, she says, they have to be willing to look at the past and the present - and talk about it as if the nation depended upon it. Which, many say, it does.\n\n\"I think it's on us,\" Ms. Chorley says. \"We as white people need to be gathering up our white people.\"\n\nBut getting white Americans to genuinely wrestle with these issues, Ms. Jardina says, will be a struggle.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The lines sound quaint today, but make no mistake, British and French colonialists of the time did believe that they were fighting ``savage wars of peace'' to save the benighted races of the world from themselves by forcing the benefits of civilization, Christianity, and commerce on them.\n\nThe crowning achievement of colonialism was its self-justifying ideology, that European superiority obligated them to conquer and exploit others for the others' benefit, an ideology that denied the benefits colonialists themselves received from colonial exploitation.\n\nOddly enough, we are embarked on a contemporary ``civilizing mission'' of our own in the name of saving the environment that we ourselves are largely responsible for destroying. We are again calling others to account, holding them responsible for our own exploitation. And again these are the poor and weak of the world, those who have been the victims of our violence.\n\nTake the issue of population. It is an established doctrine in the West, enshrined in the policies of the World Bank and in such popular books as Paul Ehrlich's ``The Population Bomb,'' that ``rampant population growth'' is a time bomb that threatens to destroy the world; that poor third world peoples are primarily responsible for that growth; and that these same people will not become any richer until they can control their irrational passion to increase their numbers. The only indisputable fact here is that population growth is most rapid today in the poorer nations of the third world, but the rest of the equation is, quite simply, wrong.\n\nFirst, it is not population that threatens the environment but how much that population consumes. Who consumes the most? Certainly not the poor of the world. Americans are less than 5 percent of the world's population, but we consume over half of all its resources. An American annually consumes hundreds of times the resources of an African. It is we who pose far more danger to the environment than the poor and their children.\n\nSecond, we must ask why poor people have so many children. It is a well established fact of historical demography that people only begin to limit their families when they become wealthier. Why is this so? Because children are the main resource of the poor, helping them to work their farms and providing security in their old age, while money is the main resource of the wealthy and children cost money.\n\nPeople are not poor because they have too many children, as we would have it, but they have many children because they are poor. It is the rational thing for them to do, and only improving their standard of living will encourage them to limit the number of children they have.\n\nThus if we wish to improve the world's environment, we must be prepared both to reduce our own consumption and to share our remaining wealth so that others do not have to depend so heavily on their own children to survive. That, however, is an unpalatable doctrine, so we smugly blame the victims whom we have exploited for their own poverty.\n\nOther examples abound. We blame Africans for not conserving their wildlife, when the establishment of game parks has threatened both domestic herds and wildlife by artificially constricting their grazing routines, to the benefit only of wealthy Western tourists. As poor African farmers and herders require more and more land for their own survival, conservation strikes them as yet another colonialist plot to exploit their resources, ostensibly for their own good.\n\nWe blame Brazilians for callously destroying the tropical rain forest, heedless of the needs of poor Indians, rubber tappers, and landless peasants for its resources or of the fact that it is our pollution and destruction of our own forests that makes preservation of their rain forest so critical.\n\nNo one can deny that environmental degradation is the most serious crisis the whole world faces today, but until the environmental movement accurately assesses our own dominant role in environmental destruction, places poor people among those endangered by it, and considers their needs on a par with our own, third world people will find its self-serving morality no more acceptable than that of the colonialists a century ago. Otherwise, environmentalism bodes well to become the imperialism of the 21st century.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The park and its sprawling \"buffer\" zone lay in the great shadow of Mount Gorongosa, with a large and complicated ecosystem fed by a complex of rivers making their way from the mountain to the Pungwe River and down to the Indian Ocean. The landscapes were as variable as the weather - lush grasslands, dense rain forest, open scrub, and all of it thickly populated with wildlife: herds of elephants, great roving packs of wild hunting dogs and prides of lions, dozens of different species of antelope, and a glorious riot of birds, many of which made their home nowhere else on the continent.\n\nThen disaster struck. Mozambique's struggle against its Portuguese colonial masters spilled into a ruinous civil war that lasted for 20 years and engulfed the park. Soldiers shot lions for sport, killed wild dogs as vermin, and hunted antelopes and buffalo for food. Aerial bombardments made wastelands out of what had once been thriving river-fed habitats, devastating elephant herds. By the time the war ended, Gorongosa was a tattered wreckage.\n\nEver since, extensive conservation efforts have been underway to restore the park and its environs to something like its earlier glories. Those efforts are at the heart of White Man's Game , the new book by Christian Science Monitor correspondent Stephanie Hanes, who first visited Gorongosa in 2006 and quickly fell under its spell, but with reservations: \"The land was both breathtakingly beautiful and deeply troubled, and I had the strong sense of something just out of reach, rumbling barely beneath the surface.\"\n\nThose subterranean rumblings are reflected in her book's subtitle, \"Saving Animals, Rebuilding Eden, and Other Myths of Conservation in Africa,\" where the word \"myths\" stands out like a fire alarm at a happy wedding.\n\nHanes rightly takes a dim view of the \"frankly ... appalling track record of well-meaning Americans and Europeans creating unintended consequences around the world.\" She expertly surveys some of the long history of \"do-gooder\" humanitarian interventions in Africa, from the days of Theodore Roosevelt to stories of Bono and LiveAid concerts, and she draws a tight web of connections between such condescending efforts and the modern multi-pronged struggle to revamp Mozambique's economy and maximize its tourism industry.\n\nA revived Gorongosa National Park is naturally the epicenter of such a struggle, and in \"White Man's Game,\" that epicenter is largely occupied by one man: Boston philanthropist Greg Carr, who likewise fell in love with Gorongosa and launched a campaign to bring its wildlife back.\n\nIn Hanes's book, we first meet Carr as he's restlessly reading Euripides back in Massachusetts: Greg \"would sit late into the night in his bookcase-lined library,\" Hanes writes, \"and read about the thin line between greatness and hubris, love and rage; about characters who were passion-driven in their tumultuous quests to follow a path of righteousness only to realize later that they were pursuing the wrong god.\"\n\nHanes is no doubt wise to be skeptical of Western-gesture conservation in Africa, but implicitly likening Carr to a Euripidean tragic madman is laying it on a bit thick, especially considering the fact that his main crime seems to be caring about Mozambique's natural world while also being white. The same is likewise true of Hanes's take on \"Big Green,\" the large conservation organizations like World Wildlife Fund or the Nature Conservancy, which she seems to view as well-funded shills for government and oil concerns. \"It's possible to make the argument that if Big Green didn't exist, the global environmental situation would be even worse,\" she writes. \"Still, it's hard to avoid the impression that, in many ways, the conservation industry mirrors the humanitarian assistance industry, with alarmist pledge drives, heart-stirring photos, and admonitions to 'act now!' - all to be repeated for the next grant cycle.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIn a world where nature is under assault on all sides, this kind of take is ruinously, dangerously cynical. In fact, it's not only \"possible\" to argue that \"Big Green\" has done vital work to hold back those assaults, it's impossible to argue otherwise. If not for the money and lobbying clout of these organizations (and, for all their flaws, people like Carr), places like Gorongosa would be barren chaparral, poached empty of wildlife.\n\n\"White Man's Game\" serves a vital purpose by strenuously and intelligently trying to uncouple the public relations campaigns of such conservation organizations from their day-to-day effects on the lives of the people who actually live in the affected areas. Those PR campaigns are extensive and well-funded, and as a corrective to their excesses, Hanes's book is doubtless necessary reading. She - and the rest of us - must hold out hope that places like Gorongosa will live up to their best PR.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It might be when her toddler is taking a nap, or late at night when inspiration hits. But thanks to the pandemic, she's finally devoting time to her passion.\n\n\"I've always liked writing, but I never did it seriously until the first lockdown,\" says Ms. Geronimi, who works for France's National Geographic Institute in Toulouse. \"Until then, I never knew much about the literary world or how to write a book.\"\n\nMs. Geronimi now follows several literary experts on social media and has submitted four short stories to national writing contests. She's not alone: More than 5 million French people started a writing project during the country's first lockdown, according to a May 2020 online poll .\n\nFrench society is increasingly diverse, and its publishing industry is having to stretch itself to reflect this diversity in new titles and a broader literary conversation.\n\nFrench publishing houses have been so overwhelmed by submissions that top publisher Gallimard told the public last month to stop sending unsolicited manuscripts.\n\nThe deluge of new writing follows a decadelong shift in France's publishing world from an elitist, male-dominated field to one of growing acceptance and diversity. Major publishers have created special collections to promote first-time authors and ethnic minorities while new publishing houses are opening the field to a larger spectrum of writers, styles, and subject matter. At the same time, self-publishing has exploded during the pandemic.\n\nIn parallel, writing workshops and graduate degrees in creative writing - once seen as a North American concept - are popping up around the country and acting as gateways to publication for burgeoning writers. Taken together, these efforts are forcing change in an industry steeped in tradition and pushing French literature to represent the reality of its diverse society.\n\n\"There is a real evolution when it comes to racial and gender diversity in French literature. The French author is no longer just the white man, over 50,\" says Frédérique Anne, a French writing coach who splits her time between Paris and Normandy. \"There are also more people writing for the first time who are realizing they don't need some divine intervention to do so. The field is definitely opening up.\"\n\nFrance's literary institutions have long struggled with a diversity problem. Though France doesn't collect statistics on race and ethnicity, a majority of top editors and authors have historically been white. Its literary awards heavily favor men: Since France's top literature prize, the Prix Goncourt, began in 1903, only 12 women have won.\n\nThe integration of marginalized literary voices, especially those of second-generation French or people of color, has come in fits and starts. Until the 1990s, literature written by children of immigrant parents of Maghrebis descent was categorized using a pejorative term for Arab.\n\nThe publication of a 1999 novel by Rachid Djaïdani, which described daily life in France's housing projects where many immigrants live, was a landmark in breaking the mold. Another was the publication in 2007 of a controversial literary collection by second-generation French writers about their complex relationship with France.\n\nBut progress has been incremental. Publishers still gravitate to books by people of color from Francophone Africa or the United States, rather than minority writers who grew up in France.\n\n\"I've always been struck by the lack of representation in French literature of my reality: what it means to be Black in France,\" says Gladys Marivat, a Paris-based literary journalist.\n\nIn 2015, she interviewed all of the major publishing houses in Paris as part of an investigation into the lack of diversity in French literature; her report went unpublished.\n\n\"When I asked [publishers] why this was the case,\" says Ms. Marivat, \"the answer was always the same: a total incomprehension of my question. They said, 'But we publish authors from Francophone Africa.' But that's not the same thing.\"\n\nPublishers have struggled with how best to broaden their range of titles. Publisher JC Lattès uses its \"La Grenade\" label - created last year by acclaimed author and child of Turkish-Kurdish refugees Mahir Guven - to promote work by socioeconomic and ethnic minorities, and publishes one novel per month by a first-time author. Gallimard's \"Continent Noir\" (Black Continent) collection features literature by and about Africa and its diaspora.\n\nThese imprints face competition from a new generation of publishers, like Face Cachées and Hors d'atteinte, which focus on stories about topics such as feminism, rap, or racism.\n\n\"There's really a strong intention to be the most open, the most curious,\" says Anne-Sophie Stefanini, literary director at JC Lattès and a published author. \"French publishing houses, big or small, are thinking about diversity right now. It's a concern for all literary editors of this generation.\"\n\nFor some new or struggling writers, niche labels are preferable to well-known publishing houses. After several rejections by mainstream publishers, Bordeaux-based writer Thomas Andrew turned to Juno Publishing - which specializes in romance books - for his fantasy and LGBT romance novels.\n\n\"I was told by a few publishers that my story was good, but could I change the romance between two men to a man and a woman? I thought, no way,\" says Mr. Andrew, who has published nine novels with Juno. \"But publishers are not going to put money into something that strays from the norm and won't sell.\"\n\nWhile France's 10,000-odd publishers collectively put out nearly 200 books a day, some writers opt to go it alone. In 2017, one in five books printed in France was self-published, up from one in 10 in 2010, according to the French National Library.\n\nTerence Samba, a 24-year-old writer who is Black and grew up in the Paris suburbs, self-published his first novel in December after being rejected by several publishers. \"It's a closed-off world and literary houses keep the same writers for years,\" Mr. Samba complains. \"Oftentimes I was asked to include a photo with my manuscript. That creates a very delicate situation.\"\n\nPart of the challenge is also encouraging marginalized French voices to write in the first place. Since 2013, the University of Paris VIII has offered one of the few graduate degrees in creative writing in the country, and aims to accept a diverse range of applicants - from newly minted graduates to midlife professionals.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In Booker Prize-winning author Peter Carey's latest novel, a 1950s road rally serves as both an entertaining travelogue and a plot device. As an Australian writer, Carey has not previously dealt with race relations in his country, contending that as a white man, he is not qualified. But that's all changed in his latest novel. A Long Way From Home starts off in a highly entertaining vein and then morphs into something altogether darker and more introspective.\n\nThe first voice we hear in the book is that of the initial narrator, Irene Bobs, restless homemaker and mother of two. She's a ball of energy in overalls, a woman who likes nothing more than to slide under the chassis of an automobile. She's in love with her car-salesman husband, Titch, and considers it her job to shield him from his bullying father. The senior Bobs is a former aviation hero and scrapyard owner known as Dangerous Dan. Every time it looks as though the Bobs family has finally ditched him, Dan shows up again, foiling their plans.\n\nThe Bobs family has moved to the small town of Bacchus Marsh in Victoria with the idea of opening a car dealership. As a way to gain publicity for their venture, they invest their savings to enter the Redex Reliability Trial, a 9,600-mile, 17-day endurance road test around Australia sponsored by the Redex motor-oil company. Participants drive ordinary passenger vehicles and are allowed only minor modifications, including extra fuel tanks. The punishing route will take them through dense forest, boggy wetlands, and vast, trackless deserts.\n\nThe book's second voice, alternating with Irene's, belongs to Willie Bachhuber, their eccentric next-door neighbor, who serves as navigator on the trip. Willie was a quiz show genius and schoolteacher, but now he's lying low to avoid questioning from school officials about his discipline methods. During the race, his map-reading skills keep them moving in the right direction, with a few setbacks along the way, including sabotage by Dangerous Dan, who has also entered the race, further infuriating Irene.\n\nThe farther north they go, the team encounters increasing evidence of Australia's brutal history. At one stop, Irene stumbles on a mass grave containing the remains of Aboriginal people who were slaughtered for their land. She brings back the small skull of a child, which reminds her of her own children. As they drive deeper into Western Australia, their presence elicits curiosity and something more menacing from the inhabitants, in particular one old black man, who invites himself along on a segment of the race. His attention is drawn to Willie, who can't shake a feeling of unease.\n\nFrom this point in the novel - without giving the plot twist away - everything shifts: One character unexpectedly moves into the foreground while the others drop back, and even the automobile race becomes incidental. The mood changes as the author delves into the question of racial identity within the larger history of Australia's subjugation of its indigenous peoples. This was Peter Carey's aim all along, and he has led the reader to this place to highlight the need for a reckoning with the past.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His writing is studded with Aussie slang that takes a few chapters to get used to, but his evocative descriptions of the outback need no translation. He's created characters whose quirks and peccadillos make them both lovable and flawed until suddenly, the narrative thrusts them into a different story altogether.\n\nCarey's gift is that readers are willing to follow him on this journey of self-discovery, cleverly disguised as a road trip.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "White Men Are Feeling Left Out Of DEI. Why Should We Care and What Should We Do?\n\nBy Teresa Hopke\n\nBy Teresa Hopke ,\n\nContributor.\n\nThere are white men who feel like, \"You're talking about me without including me in the ... More conversation.\" - Steven Humerickhouse, Executive Director, Forum on Workplace Inclusion\n\nBack in the days of middle school gym class, getting picked for kickball may have felt as intense as any major-league draft. There would be excitement for some, but for others this situation brought on prepubescent catastrophizing and \"what ifs\" around possibly being among the last remaining players to get chosen.\n\nWhat was so dreadful about it were the anxious thoughts of being overlooked and excluded. But of course, that would go unspoken as the captains continued to make their selections.\n\nBut here is a thought: What if the players were given the opportunity to pick which team to play on, rather than the captains picking which individuals they wanted on their team? Well, this may not have necessarily changed the way the game gets played, but it could have empowered each individual player in a way that impacted the way they showed up in the game - because the fear of being excluded was lifted off of them at the start.\n\nNow fast forward to the current world of work where Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, when it is rightfully embedded into an organization's culture, are changing the game for the good of all. And although the mission is to ensure that employees of all genders, races and ethnicities, abilities and disabilities, religions, cultures, ages, and sexual orientations are included, have their voices heard, and receive opportunities for advancement...there is a group that has been feeling excluded from these efforts - white men.\n\nWhite men hold most leadership positions and decision-making power in US society (and globally). So, at first glance, it may seem surprising to learn that they are feeling excluded from anything. But according to the White Men's Leadership Study, a study of white men and DEI, nearly 70% report feeling \"forgotten\" by diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Feeling uncertain about whether DEI includes them is the main reason they say they either disengage or are not as committed to it as others in their organization.\n\nIs DEI really disregarding white men? And is this something that leaders should be tending to? In an effort to bring awareness, insight, and empathy to this seemingly taboo topic, I've invited Renu Sachdeva, Head of DEI, North America, Talking Talent, Inc, and Steven Humerickhouse , Executive Director of The Forum on Workplace Inclusion, both of whom are DEI champions, to help explore why white men may be feeling left out of DEI and what might be done about it.\n\nTeresa Hopke: I think a great starting point is to acknowledge that everyone wants to feel a sense of belonging, to feel included. No one wants to feel disadvantaged, as if something is being taken away from them. But some of the stories I am hearing from white men in regard to DEI are things like:\n\nSteven Humerickhouse: People who come with that kind of mindset automatically assume that they're not a part of the conversation and don't even want to be a part of the conversation. Because they think it limits them. And I think there is also a little bit of defensiveness around, \"What can I say or do and what can I not say or do?''\n\nEven just down to terminology, it feels like a landmine. Every step you take could be some place where it could explode on you. So, when people are looking for them (white men) to participate, they're already feeling a bit on the defense before they even show up. Because they don't want to feel accused or threatened or like a target.\n\nRenu Sachdeva: I have also heard in the work that I've done that some white men don't like to attend DEI trainings because they feel like they're implicitly or explicitly being blamed for the current state of affairs, or that they're being shamed for having the privileges they have. Then there is the concept of feeling disadvantaged, which is the thought of, \"Well if you are giving more opportunities to women, people of color etc, then that means you're giving fewer opportunities to me.\" This is zero-sum bias thinking, which can happen consciously or unconsciously. And there are some white men who would say, \"We just want it to be equal. It's not fair that women and minorities are being given more preference over us. We just want it to be fair.\"\n\nHopke : Steven, what was it like for you when you got involved in DEI?\n\nHumerickhouse: When I got involved in DEI work over 20 years ago, it wasn't a job I wanted. It was a job I got. I mean, look at me, I'm a white guy, right. My daughter was adopted from Honduras, so I had some lived experience with this diversity thing, but it wasn't something that I myself thought I needed to live because I was a white guy, and I had all that privilege. But I saw possibilities at The Forum . There were things in my skill sets that I knew could help move this thing along, and everyone was really passionate about what they were doing. So, I learned all the DEI stuff on the way, literally listening to our community members and reading proposals and whatever else I could get my hands on.\n\nWhite people don't think they have race and are different. I have the power and privilege, so everybody else is different from me. But when I went to China a couple of years ago, I was the difference. I got some deference because I was an older man, so age has had some privileges in China. But otherwise, I didn't speak the language. I couldn't access the transportation system. I definitely stood out in that space in Shanghai. This idea of race, it's all relative and so white people don't see themselves in that. Other people live it every day. My daughter is Latina. She lives that every day, and my grandchildren who are mixed race of Black and Latino live that every day. So, we are really all in this, but the white folks don't always know that they are. That was, I suppose, the growth moment for me in the beginning. That was the learning experience for me...that I am a part of this.\n\nHopke: What do you think needs to happen to get white men to a space where they are open and willing to embrace the ideas of a more inclusive culture - especially when there are walls built up from what they see as an attack on who they are?\n\nHumerickhouse: White men are feeling the pressure. It's all about fear and so we have to think about it in that way. We have to ask ourselves if in our DEI spaces, are we really open to hearing those missing voices? I suppose there are white men who feel like, \"You're talking about me without including me in the conversation.\"\n\nWe also have to think of the empathy piece and meeting people where they are. There can be all kinds of reasons why they are where they are. They can be racist. They can be ignorant. They can be owning their privilege or not ever wanting to admit that they have it. But that's where they are. I think it's about just allowing people to be who they are, and then helping them understand where their shortcomings may be.\n\nHopke: Yes. Coaching, conversation and heart-based experiences that create levels of empathy and compassion are the key to making progress. We can't push, pull, force or shame white men into the DEI conversation. We have to invite them in. Help them see what's in it for them. Help them see that they aren't under attack. And most importantly, help them understand what to DO because many of them are paralyzed by the fear of doing the wrong thing.\n\nHumerickhouse: I come from a very religious Republican family. My background is rural and conservative. Would people like me (but not me exactly) actually even feel comfortable in our \"liberal\" DEI spaces? The interesting thing is that in speeches when I talk about this feeling of loss that I mentioned earlier, I get a whole lot of texts back saying \"Thank you.\" Because although those folks were in the room (not as many as we'd like, but they are there), they felt silenced until I called them out and said, \"You're a part of this conversation.\"\n\nDEI work is a lifelong learning thing. There is no end point for the work itself and there's certainly no endpoint for the individual journey until, of course, the journey is over.\n\nSo, how DO you open yourself up, white man, to be able to be more aware? Let's take the Crown act for example. Well, say I don't understand what that means. I don't have hair like that. My hair has always been very straight. It just has always been. So, I don't know what it means for hair to be an issue. It's just something that I've never had to deal with so it's not part of my experience. I don't even have a concept of that. But that fact does not invalidate someone else's lived experience - just because I don't have that experience.\n\nSachdeva: And from an organizational standpoint, when organizations do DEI right, all the studies, all the business cases show that if you actually have a diverse workforce, if you have an inclusive culture, if you have equitable systems and processes, then your company will likely perform better than your competitors who may not be investing in DEI. So that's another piece to help people understand - yes, in the short term, there may be fewer opportunities for a group that was used to having access to more. But if we can grow the business and the business can be successful, in large part through our investment in DEI, then eventually there should be more opportunities for everyone. The \"pie\" gets bigger.\n\nHopke: Agree. And it's not that white men are saying that they don't care about DEI or want the pie to get bigger. Most of them say that they do. According to one study, 42% of white cis-gendered men believe that DEI is \"extremely important.\" So, how white men show up for DEI may look different, but their support is still there and still needed. Inclusive leaders will do the work to go after that support, because they know that DEI is an \"all hands on deck\" commitment.\n\nWhite men can be powerful allies, advocates, mentors, and sponsors for diverse talent. Then there's the impact that can come from when they are acknowledging and lending their privilege. But if they don't feel welcome to participate in the first place, then none of this will happen - at least not meaningfully or consistently.\n\nHumerickhouse: And we have to bring along those folks who would push back on this idea, helping them realize that people like me must be included. In fact, because we (white men) do have power and privilege, we can't advance this (DEI) unless we use that power and privilege to advance others and give power and privilege to others.\n\nUltimately, if you feel like you belong, the likelihood is that someone has made you feel like you do. We all need to feel that sense of belonging and whether that's based on your race, gender, orientation, or different ability from other people in the organization, we all want to be in a place where we feel \"at home.\" That's no less true for a white man.\n\nHopke: Inclusive leaders will need to remember that even if someone isn't initially supportive of DEI, they can still be reached and enlightened on the importance of the issue. We just need to lift the fear of exclusion for them. We need to assure them that the childhood playground teams traumas aren't at play today and rid them of zero sum thinking. As you build your DEI strategy, be mindful not to unintentionally exclude white men. And at the same time, white men also need not exclude themselves, because they are a critical part of the mission to build a more fair and inclusive world. And that right there is why we should care!"

      "text": "The Liberation Of Learning About Race: A White Man's Journey Toward Anti-Racism\n\nBy Nell Derick Debevoise\n\nBy Nell Derick Debevoise ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nDr. Garrett Weatherhead is a licensed psychologist in private practice in the suburbs close to Grand Rapids, Michigan. He is a husband and father of two girls, ages six and three. We had this conversation about the portion of his anti-racism journey that has emerged from Dr. Weatherhead's podcast interview with Klay S. Williams, our mutual friend and colleague.\n\nNell Derick Debevoise: I strongly encourage readers to listen to your conversation with Klay S. Williams, but for now, would you summarize the podcast that led us here?\n\nDr. Garrett Weatherhead: Klay followed up to a Facebook post I made that said something like, \"I am ready to live into a more consistently anti-racist space for my personal life.\" He called and invited me to discuss the post on his podcast It was very scary, and I didn't know what I was in for, but I said yes. On the podcast, he wonderfully took me through my journey from not thinking racism is a big deal to where I'm at now, where I see becoming anti-racist as a primary part of who I am and what I'm here to do.\n\nThe podcast centers on my doctoral studies. I went to a program with a focus on multiculturalism, and really, race and racism. How does race and racism affect relationships, mental health, and every aspect of psychology. Within the program, I was forced to think and talk about race and racism nearly every day for five years. That experience shifted how I saw the world in a very deep way. It shifted how I think about myself and my relationships.\n\nDerick Debevoise: What has your anti-racism journey looked like since you and Klay recorded the podcast six months ago?\n\nWeatherhead: Before the podcast, I was doing therapy and enjoying it, having seen that work as aligned with my purpose for a long time. One of Klay's questions was, \"How does your anti-racism journey intersect with your sense of purpose?\" I had not thought about that connection previously, but now I've been thinking about it near daily. I've come to understand that my purpose is to enter this anti-racist space consistently in personal and professional ways. That's the shift that occurred after the podcast.\n\nListen to Weatherhead and Williams discuss the messiness and liberation of the anti-racism journey.\n\nDerick Debevoise: Does your anti-racism play out in what you do or how you do things?\n\nWeatherhead: Both. It has played out in what I do, because I have spent a lot more time thinking and considering what work I can do in this anti-racism space. It's been a conversation with my wife about making more time in my schedule not for doing therapy but for thinking about anti-racism. In terms of how I do things, I think I'm more open than I was. I think previously, if you knew me, you might know about my anti-racism journey. My hope is that now, if you know me, you definitely know about my commitment to anti-racism. The shift in how I do things is being much more upfront about who I am in this space.\n\nDerick Debevoise: What insights have come from your anti-racism journey?\n\nWeatherhead: Wrestling with my purpose and anti-racism prompted a conversation with myself about why anti-racism has become so important to me. I have realized that because of my education and the gift of understanding a little bit more about racism, I am more connected to myself. I didn't realize that racism was a disconnecting factor from my true self, but now I see that it was.\n\nAnother insight from learning about racism is how much disconnection is caused between white people and People of Color. As I've come to understand racism better, it opens the door for more genuine relationships across race. So, learning about racism offered a more genuine relationship with myself, as well as with others across race.\n\nDerick Debevoise: Are there moments you've experienced that you can share to make that tangible for folks who haven't gotten there in their own journeys to anti-racism?\n\nWeatherhead: One is a friendship with a Native American woman from my doctoral program. I talk a little bit about this in the podcast: my relationship with her got to a depth that it could not have had I not known about racism. White people hurt People of Color all the time, mostly unintentionally, because of our lack of understanding about what our whiteness has done and continues to do. Being able to talk through that with Deidre got our relationship to a depth that it couldn't have gone otherwise.\n\nDerick Debevoise: You shared that talking about your anti-racism journey with other white people has been tiring, difficult, even painful at times. But your experience matches the research and anecdotal evidence that healthy relationships across race is good for team performance. Have you seen that benefit, and does it make the effort of becoming anti-racist worthwhile?\n\nWeatherhead: 100%. If learning about race and racism can help me to better know my true self, and have more intimate relationships with people across race, wouldn't that be wonderful for other white people to know too? Sometimes, when I talk about racism with other white people, it's terrible. It's hard, it's uncomfortable. It can even be harmful to them or our relationship sometimes.\n\nBut if we can switch the lens to an invitation, to explain that there's a reason to do this work. If you can learn more about racism, you can have a more genuine life with yourself and more genuine relationships across race. That invitation is a shift from, \"Hey, let's engage uncomfortably about racism,\" to, \"Hey, let's see if we can get to more depth in our relationships with ourselves and each other.\"\n\nDerick Debevoise: It feels like liberation for us as white folks, from not needing to have these conversations about race, because we're white and that's the default or 'norm'. But what you've experienced is that to do this anti-racism work opens up the richness, complexity and pain and beauty of what race is, for all of us as humans, not just non-white folks.\n\nWeatherhead: Absolutely. Racism is not going to change unless white people understand why it's meaningful for them to understand it. If we can shed the internalized racial superiority, we can live a more open, genuine life.\n\nDerick Debevoise: What has been messiest along the way?\n\nWeatherhead: When you start to understand the effect of racism, change has to happen. You have to change how you're living. For example, I was invited to a conference by a close friend. The speaker was very racist in ways that I probably would not have picked up on earlier in my anti-racism journey, but because I now did, I wanted to leave immediately. My decision to leave changed that relationship.\n\nAnother example is that as a result of my work, I wanted to parent differently. I wanted to teach my daughter, who was an infant at the time, about racism and other isms. My wife wasn't there yet. That's the complicated part of this conversation: you can do your own internal work, but when you start to move through your life, something's got to give, and not everyone is on the same page.\n\nDerick Debevoise: Have you found that doing your work has started to impact the people around you?\n\nWeatherhead: Yes, absolutely. Through many conversations about race and racism and how they influence our work or family, I see shifts in the people around me. I wouldn't dare take like credit for it, but that feels like a bit of a ripple. Because we got to have these conversations, their thinking and our relationships evolve. That's potent.\n\nDerick Debevoise: As Americans, capitalists in our current system, we have a strong bias to action. But you shared that a lot of your anti-racism work right now is really just holding space and time to think. How does that feel?\n\nWeatherhead: The thinking is moving somewhere potent. And so that feels good and feels valuable. When I first started to become aware during the doctoral program, I engaged in frenetic doing . Some benefit could have come out of it, but it was so frenetic and scattered that it felt like a drop in the bucket versus me using the strengths that I have to do anti-racism in a way that utilizes my strengths. That feels like a shift\n\nDerick Debevoise: Well, that's the alignment of the purpose that Klay's got you thinking about. We call it Purposeful Growth: to contribute to solving the problems we care about in the ways that make best use of our unique selves.\n\nWeatherhead: Yes. I was floundering until I got that connection. Before, I felt, \"I have to be doing this, this and this,\" and I would run myself into the ground. I actually burnt myself out and even harmed myself and others by doing fanatically, instead of moving with my own current.\n\nDerick Debevoise: What advice or encouragement do you have for people on their own anti-racism journey or maybe just beginning?\n\nWeatherhead: There's a couple things that I think about. The first one is a stance of curiosity and willingness to make mistakes. If you enter conversations about race and racism with curiosity and a willingness to fail, and lean into that discomfort, then you have a chance to get further.\n\nThe second part, which has come from my doctoral program and more recent thinking with Klay, is that there are formal and informal chances to learn about racism. The formal chances were things like our professors, the really amazing anti-racism groups teaching this, books about anti-racism. And then the informal ways, are the one-on-one interactions hearing about people's personal experiences with racism and how they have affected their trajectories. Or when a Black colleague said, \"I'm getting nervous about going to this conference,\" and then explained he didn't know if that region was safe for him as a Black man. I had never had that conversation before - those informal interactions with people who have different lived experiences than me, that has been life-changing. So we must seek out formal and informal opportunities to learn about race and racism.\n\nDerick Debevoise: Do you regret choosing the PhD program you ended up in?\n\nWeatherhead: Definitely not. I am more whole now. I don't think that I would be as whole as I feel now if I hadn't gone through the program. But I wouldn't have known it! I would have lived life, not really thinking about racism at all and, and not knowing that there is a different level of life available.\n\nDerick Debevoise: Wow. Well there's a carrot for all of us contemplating the challenging prospect of beginning or deepening our anti-racism journeys... Anyone want to reach a deeper level of life experience that you may not even know today is possible? Thank you so much, Garrett, for doing your work, and for sharing it so generously.\n\nWeatherhead: Thanks for the space. It's so nice to talk to you, the way you put things together is so wonderful. Thank you for that."

      "text": "This Therapist's Message To White Men: Become An Agent Of Change Or A Victim Of Progress\n\nBy Dana Brownlee\n\nBy Dana Brownlee ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nFormer licensed private-practice psychotherapist Andrew Horning, MSW now serves as a coach and ... More teacher at the Hoffman Institute.\n\nAs a couples therapist, Andrew Horning had become accustomed to a predictable yet problematic pattern-eager wife schedules appointment and arrives ready to share and engage while husband proceeds with extreme caution, even skepticism, defensiveness and at times stubborn resistance. Predictably, the husband's struggle to be vulnerable and open would invariably hinder both connection and progress within the relationship. Fast forward several years...Horning participated in a two-day DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) workshop with a racially mixed audience. As the workshop progressed, the facilitator labored to coax more openness from the White participants-they were visibly resistant. For Horning this resistance reminded him of the proverbial husband dragged to counseling scenario he'd witnessed so many times before. To help attendees understand the privilege that seemed invisible if not fictitious to many of the White participants, the facilitator explained, \"You know you have privilege when equity feels like discrimination.\" For Horning that moment was an epiphany. \"I thought 'That's it! We have to be willing to handle the discomfort of this work internally if we are to move forward with a deeper understanding of the experience of Black and Brown people in this country.'\" He noted a clear parallel between the individual White male resistance that hindered emotional intimacy and marital success and the collective visceral White male resistance and defensiveness in the workshop inhibiting productive exploration of the realities of racial inequities.\n\nHis conclusion-just like men need to grapple with themselves to show up better in their relationships, White men in particular need to grapple with their identity, their privilege and even their racist patterns to show up better in the world and become change agents for racial equity.\n\nWhile it can be tempting to view racism and race-based discrimination as a Black/Brown problem, many would argue that it's really an ongoing toxicity that White people must address , particularly White men, if it's to be eradicated long term. Psychotherapist Andrew Horning has embarked on a mission to urge White men to do just that. In his new book Grappling: White Men's Journey from Fragile to Agile , Horning urges White men to grapple with the reality of their identity. \"If you're a white man in America, you have a decision to make: become an agent of change or a victim of progress,\" says Horning. \"White men have found themselves entrenched in a privileged status quo for centuries. Old patterns and learned behavior have contributed to their success, but things are changing; our world is evolving. We're tackling racism and sexism head-on, and White masculinity, as we know it, is in the midst of a revolution.\"\n\nAndrew Horning's book encourages White men to grapple with their identify and privilege for inreased ... More inner peace and a stronger emotional capacity.\n\nHorning views the process of grappling-engaging in a close struggle without weapons-as the work that White men must do to build the racial stamina required to actively lean into this moment of racial reckoning. In practice grappling requires purposely exposing oneself to discomfort in order to emerge stronger and better with a simultaneous sense of power and humility. \"As White men we have to stop putting our finger in the dike that is preventing change and instead be agile in navigating it.\" insists Horning. \"We can't just say, 'If a Black person brings it up, I'll deal with it.' Our defensiveness and avoidance is more problematic than we realize.\"\n\nRecognizing that a barrier for many White men is a sense of shame, guilt or feelings of being a bad person, Horning insists that innate goodness and racist patterns are not in fact the same thing. (Similarly, Robin DiAngelo famously refers to this concept as the \"good/bad binary\" in her New York Times bestseller White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism) . \"We have to realize 'I can be a good person and have racist patterns,'\" explains Horning. \"Patterns we learned are not us; it's learned behavior that can be unlearned.\" He implores White men in particular to acknowledge those patterns as a function of their upbringing and environment. \"It's the water we swim in,\" he insists. Furthermore, he highlights the significant long-term benefits awaiting those who are brave enough to wade into this admittedly uncomfortable territory. \"The feeling of discomfort or possibly shame is only a temporary state, and if we can sustain ourselves through it, we can come out the other side confident and free,\" he explains. \"We must build up our own capacity to navigate the uncomfortable emotions that race and gender bring up among White men. We must build the muscle that has been atrophied as a result of our privilege.\"\n\nThat work doesn't just yield long term benefits for the individual, but it can also change how they show up in the workplace among peers and colleagues. When they meet a new person of color at a race related event, they're less likely to awkwardly rattle off their \"racial resume\" and more likely to actually engage with the individual. When uncomfortable discussions ensue in the workplace, they're less likely to focus their energies on defending their character and more likely to think critically about how to create more equity. Even when they might be accused of an offensive or racist comment or action, they're more likely to lean into the discussion and get curious instead of reflexively responding with defensiveness...or anger.\n\nIn his new book Horning also urges White men to step up in a new, more forceful way to become agents of change for racial reconciliation and equity. \"We have to stop defending and distracting from the original sin in our country of slavery,\" he insists. \"As White people we have to be willing to deal with the truth and be an ally and amplify the voices of Black and Brown people.\" Horning also challenges the concept of American meritocracy and instead considers it more of a \"mirror-tocracy\" as White men have continually benefited by seeing their own archetype continually reinforced and celebrated. Possibly most importantly, this grappling can yield significant tangible advances in racial equity outcomes. He insists, \"When White men who hold the levers of power start grappling, larger systemic change can happen.\"\n\nFor those who question or criticize his focus on White men specifically, he first acknowledges that White men are undeniably at the top of the proverbial food chain in America, a phenomenon that Pulitzer Prize winning author Isabel Wilkerson explores in her New York Times bestseller Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents . \"This potent, problematic and paradoxical combination of whiteness and maleness has given us so much and yet left us with so little,\" admits Horning. \"We have so many advantages that largely go unacknowledged and unseen by us, and those privileges have left us with fewer skills at dealing with the changing world around us.\" He asks White men to grapple with the idea that they're not entitled to psychological comfort and to consider the fact that insistence on comfort may be what's preventing many of them from progressing from fragile to agile. For this reason, he refers to the \"gift of the grapple\" insisting that this conscious exposure to what's uncomfortable ultimately yields more inner peace and a stronger emotional capacity.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to paint a myopic view of white supremacy as men in hoods burning crosses in yards, the truth is that the general ideology of White male supremacy is much more subtle, nuanced and ubiquitous. As a White male psychotherapist, Horning has grappled with that himself and asks other White men to join him in grappling with their White male identity. He reflects, \"As White men, we have been lauded for changing the world, then we were told to change yourself first and then change the world. This new era is asking us to first allow the world to change us. We don't know what we thought we did, and that is a hard place to be when you aren't used to it.\"\n\nStay tuned for the follow up article based on Horning's work \"If You're Ever Called Out As 'Racist' At Work, Remember These Four Simple Steps.\""

      "text": "White Men Are Feeling Left Out Of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion. Why Should We Care and What Should We Do? - Part 2\n\nBy Teresa Hopke\n\nBy Teresa Hopke ,\n\nContributor.\n\nIf you've got a real diversity of people and are trying hard to connect and collaborate and be real, ... More then you're going to make some mistakes, but you're not going to let them slide.\n\nFor those who love a good board game, a few rousing rounds of Taboo can be an entertaining way to unwind (or in my case, get the competitive juices flowing). But what if the game took on a more serious tone? What if instead of trying to guess celebrities or TV show titles, a player pulled a card where their team had to guess why white men feel excluded from DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives? How do you think you'd do with that one?\n\nChances are, most would probably take one look at that particular card and put it at the bottom of the deck until maybe it came back up again. That's because, unfortunately, confronting the idea of white men feeling excluded from DEI is a real taboo topic.\n\nThis issue goes beyond the idea of white men feeling uncomfortable around conversations on diversity and inclusion. The deeper conversation that we need to have is that some white men believe that they can never truly be authentic in expressing how they feel about how inclusion has led to their exclusion. It has also led many of them to resentment and resistance towards embracing DEI efforts altogether.\n\nThe reality is that DEI initiatives are often designed with everyone but white men in mind. This is due to the fact that marginalized groups are the ones who have been historically excluded and underrepresented. It's the diverse talent in organizations that are also more likely to experience bias, discrimination, and microaggressions.\n\nMeanwhile, white men have had the advantage, and just as we pointed out in part 1 of this series, they hold most leadership positions and decision-making power in US society (and globally). So many people simply don't recognize that white men can possibly feel excluded from DEI. It can be easy to assume that white men don't face any barriers and do not experience feeling left out.\n\nHowever, despite their privileged status and access to positions of power, some white men are feeling like their voices are ignored, or that their concerns are dismissed as irrelevant, unimportant or offensive. Additionally, they may be less likely to see themselves as essential (as everyone is by the way) to DEI efforts, and therefore feel hesitant or even resistant when it comes to supporting these initiatives.\n\nPeople resist what they don't feel connected to or see a need for. So, it's imperative that inclusive leaders cultivate safe, supportive environments that inspire even the reluctant to embrace DEI for the benefit of all.\n\nTo help inclusive leaders better understand why white men feel left out of DEI and how to engage the resisters I'm joined by Michael Baran , social scientist and Senior Partner & Digital Solutions Lead at InQuest Consulting and co-author (with Dr. Tiffany Jana ) of Subtle Acts of Exclusion , for part two of this critical conversation.\n\nTeresa Hopke: Michael, I know that DEI issues matter tremendously to you in the work that you do. I am curious about how you came to be involved in this work.\n\nMichael Baran: I chose this career path, and I would call it a path because I didn't know exactly where it would end, really out of a fascination with people and a passion to create equity and inclusion cultures and systems where people could be treated equally. Through getting to know a diversity of people and hearing their stories and traveling and seeing the world, I just got really fascinated by these issues and wanting to understand them.\n\nWe all have unconscious bias that's the way just the way it is, but that wouldn't be enough for me. I had all these questions, like wait a minute....why, DO we have these biases in our heads that we don't even know are there and we wouldn't want to be there?? How does that happen? And what do you mean cultures can make some people feel really valued and welcomed and respected and other people, not so much?\"\n\nThe ways in which that happens are really subtle and hard to see. So, I went and got my doctorate in cultural anthropology and cognitive psychology to really investigate those questions. I spent eight years diving into that trying to understand how it happens from birth to adulthood, and with the idea being when we really understand what's going on we can better figure out what to do about it.\n\nI needed to really figure it out myself before figuring out what to do about it. And figuring out what to do about it led me to deeper work with organizations. I first did some teaching. I taught at Harvard for a while and just started a consultancy on the side and it just snowballed to the point where I knew I had to do it full time and that it was really my calling.\n\nOne of my special skills in this space is, I think I can really explain it to people in a way they understand. Like to a white man who doesn't have the experience with it and doesn't have that deep understanding, I can explain it in a way that makes sense. Because they don't get the foundational part of it, and so we really need to help them along on the journey, while also recognizing that we're not all starting from the same place.\n\nHopke: As I was reading your book and your work concerning human behaviors, particularly bias, it hit me that you've researched and investigated these issues similar to how Brene' Brown has studied vulnerability and shame. Especially with how particular you are with how you provide understanding and language to the experience of exclusion.\n\nBaran: Absolutely. I mean that's the basis of some of the work in Subtle Acts of Exclusion . Understanding those subtle interactions that are really going on with communication. Conveying all of these unintended messages to people that are real. They're under the surface.\n\nOne of the cool things about cultural anthropology is you train yourself to go and live in a place where the culture is entirely unfamiliar to you. I lived for two years in northeast Brazil.\n\nAnd so, the idea is that you can't take anything for granted, none of your assumptions about people work. All you can do is ask questions. And really listen to people's answers and observe. Soon, you get to the point where that starts to feel really comfortable and normal and natural to you. Then you come home and that's where the real culture shock is. You start to see things in your own culture from a more objective and clear perspective.\n\nHopke: I'd say that DEI is bringing about some culture shock. And some of that culture shock isn't sitting well with the majority. How can inclusive leaders reach those in the majority who are resistant to DEI, but do it in a way that still keeps the focus on its purpose - creating fair and equitable workplace cultures, especially for marginalized groups that have historically been excluded?\n\nBaran: I think some practical things that can happen are to really create a culture that does a couple of things. First, it has to be one that understands and expects that people don't know all of this (DEI) and they're going to mess up. That's key.\n\nWhen one of my kids was in preschool, every morning they repeated their values as a class and one of their values was, \"We make mistakes.\" When that becomes part of who you are, then you are not scared to try new things and to do hard things. You don't necessarily feel bad when you mess up, you just want to figure out what to do differently, and what to do better, and how to learn and how to grow.\n\nThat's a culture where it's not walking on eggshells because I don't want to do the wrong thing. But it's understanding that of course you're going to mess up. We all are. But we can get better. That's one of the things that is really important.\n\nThe other piece of the culture that I think is just so important is recognizing you can have at the same time, kindness AND accountability. Nobody wants to walk on eggshells, in a place. If you've got a real diversity of people and are trying hard to connect and collaborate and be real, then you're going to make some mistakes, but you're not going to let them slide. You're going to address them in real ways and you're going to move on.\n\nInclusive leadership is all about making everyone feel welcomed, valued and respected. It's not about excluding some people in our efforts to be more inclusive of others. It's not a zero-sum game.\n\nHopke: For sure. And it reminds me of something that Renu Sachdeva said in our previous conversation. She mentioned that zero-sum bias, thinking that one person's gain must equal another's disadvantage or loss, is something that can happen consciously or unconsciously. So, for the most part, people don't even realize that's at the root of their feeling excluded or that it could be behind them excluding others.\n\nI believe it really comes down to organizational AND individual mindset shifts on what inclusion truly looks like.\n\nBaran: There are people who genuinely want to do the right thing. They also really want authentic relationships with people who are different from them. It's just that they often don't know how to do it. But what they're going to realize when they do make that shift and start making those connections is that it feels good. And they're going to feel empowered to do it more...hopefully.\n\nHopke: Hopefully, yes. Because it's those connections that drive change. And it's those connections that fuel the courage that it takes to have the type of conversations that create real change. But that is the antithesis of what we at Talking Talent hear often in our conversations with leaders, \"It's safer not to engage so that I don't say or do the wrong thing.\"\n\nBaran: That's why it's so important to create a space where people can ask questions. Like after I did a talk, an older white gentleman stood up and asked, \"Is it even okay, to say the word \"black\" or \"Asian?\" l just don't even know what words are going to make people upset and which aren't.\" We were able to have a real conversation about that. After the talk, his manager came up to me and she said, \"This is a testament to this welcoming space, because I can't believe he stood up in front of 500 people and asked that question, which could be really embarrassing for him.\"\n\nHopke: That took courage. And I'm sure that there were others who were so glad that he asked because they didn't have the courage to. And that manager is right, the welcoming space made the difference and helped him to take a chance and ask a vulnerable question. We actually suggest that organizations provide group coaching or learning experiences specifically for the majority - to give them an opportunity to connect with others like them in a safe space that allows them to get some of their resentment off their chests. It can be a really powerful experience!\n\nIn the day-to-day workplace, how can colleagues encourage the white men they work with to be more vocal and courageous as it relates to DEI, while also helping them to be aware of the potential places where they may be unintentionally \"white-splaining\" or \"man-splaining?\"\n\nBaran: We have to take a step back kind of and think about how we are having learning experiences or training for everyone. Because white men don't see it, not all white men, of course, but a lot. I often do talks about how, for example, women get cut off more in meetings or don't get credit for their ideas.\n\nSo, I'll tell people about this research that's been done, and it's almost like clockwork that some of the men will turn to the women in the room and say, \"Well, that doesn't happen here, right?\" And the women go, \"Are you kidding me?? Yes, that happens here.\" But they haven't seen it because it's not happening to them.\n\nSo, we have to help them see that and also understand the value of listening. And to make them understand that you're not as good at listening as you think you are. Real listening, not listening when you're formulating what you're going to say in your head, not playing devil's advocate and pushing back for no reason. Not filtering everything someone says, through your own understanding, like, \"Well that wouldn't have made me upset. I don't see why you would care about that.\" They need help to understand what real listening means.\n\nAnd part of it is an interaction thing, where the other person gets to feel heard. It's not a simple task.\n\nWhen we got calls after the murder of George Floyd, business were like, \"Quick! Get in here! We need listening sessions. We really need to hear from our black and African American colleagues.\" And we were like, \"You're so not ready to even listen. You're going to do real harm actually if you try to jump into this.\" They needed to take a step back.\n\nThe same is true now. You have to first have some sessions on what it means to really listen to people.\n\nHopke: Right. DEI is not a \"please break glass in case of emergency\" plan. DEI is meant to be foundational, carefully cultivated, and applied with thoughtfulness and intention. What's your advice for leaders who are willing to take that step back now for reflection so that they can step up for their people in more meaningful ways?\n\nBaran: I often use the analogy of pushups. You're not going to go from never doing a push up to doing 500 pushups a day. It's just not going to happen. You have got to start small and build up those muscles.\n\nAnd the same thing with D&I. It's going to take building up those muscles. And there is going to be fumbling and stumbling through it a little bit. But that's okay.\n\nHopke: It's definitely a process. And to your point about really listening to people, that means we must also be ready and willing to tune into what Steven Humerickhouse , who joined us in part 1 of this discussion, calls \"the missing voices.\" He pointed out that this includes white men who may not feel as though they even have a safe space to voice how they are experiencing DEI. They might even be feeling, as Steven said, \"You're talking about me without including me in the conversation.\"\n\nSo, what are your thoughts on why white men might feel like they can't authentically take part in the DEI conversation? What could be causing them to feel overlooked, resentful, or unwilling to fully embrace DEI efforts? Can you share what you've seen and heard in your work?\n\nBaran: What I'm seeing is that there are many varied reasons why white men are feeling like outsiders to the DEI conversation.\n\nI think some white men want to play a part in it but feel hesitant and fearful that they won't be welcomed or that they will say the wrong thing. They worry about not understanding the core concepts or issues and wonder if they do participate, they might somehow be seen as inauthentic.\n\nFor others, they don't see how it's a conversation that is about them, so they may be more actively resistant. That's why they may push back against some of the DEI efforts and concepts in their organizations. Also, from their perspective, they are even being blamed for the issues. So, they do not want to put themselves in a position where they would be made to feel bad or guilty.\n\nThen there are white men who are anti-DEI because they have bought into some of the divisive political rhetoric that distorts and manipulates DEI issues.\n\nAnd I believe many white men can struggle with DEI conversations because of the way that they have been socialized. They may find it difficult to really hear other perspectives, to see the subtle ways they have been centered and validated. It's hard for them to conceptualize what it means to have true inclusion and equity for all.\n\nI also think that a lot of people, white men included, are struggling right now. And so white men in particular may feel resentful that people are making assumptions about them and their privilege, without hearing or caring for those struggles.\n\nThese are just some of the reasons I have encountered in my work and in my research.\n\nHopke: And I'd like to add that tapping into empathy can take you far, too. Someone on my team said recently, \"Oh, the places you will go when empathy is leading the way.\" I've seen that to be true in my work of helping leaders to build more inclusive cultures, even when they are still trying to get buy-in across the organization.\n\nFor inclusive leaders who are wanting to be empathetic in addressing this issue of white men feeling excluded from DEI, how can they help others on their teams to do the same? Especially when those people might be feeling frustrated that this is even an issue - particularly when the underrepresented talent in the organization are those who have been historically and systematically excluded at work and in society at large?\n\nBaran: That's a great question. I mean the ironic thing is others probably do have some empathy. They probably can understand it, because they've been through it.\n\nBecause they have been marginalized and I think that's one of the key foundations of empathy. They probably do get it.\n\nBut the much harder task is getting those white men to realize that this has been happening for so long to these people who have been marginalized. And to really understand that and to not think that everything's been so fair and equal and now all of a sudden white men are getting sidelined.\n\nThat feels like a much harder task. If you said, \"Michael, you have to speak to this group of marginalized people and your goal is to get them to have empathy for these white men.\" I might just say, \"You know how you've been feeling this for so long? You don't want other people to feel that. If we really want to work together right, we've got to make everyone feel valued and so we've got to figure out a way to come together and do that.\"\n\nHopke: And what would you say are the hallmarks of organizations that do \"work together right\"?\n\nBaran: One piece of it is doing an audit or something, making sure that all your policies and procedures and practices are creating equity and inclusion and not the opposite. That's important because then you've got data.\n\nAlso there needs to be a learning journey of sorts to get people where they need to be and getting everyone on the same page with various trainings. For people managers and for all staff - getting people on board with the same framework and language and understanding is so key so you feel like you're in this together. It's not one thing that's being done for people. But we're all in together to make our organization as strong as it can be.\n\nIt's a good thing for people to get that inclusion and equity is great for all people. And it's also good for business. If it was bad for business, it would be a hard sell. Luckily, it's also good for business!\n\nHopke: What are you really proud of with the work you're doing right now?\n\nBaran: I am really proud of how we address the issues. More inclusion and equity for everyone, not at the expense of some people, but really everyone. And I'm proud to be facilitating connections. Those real connections. Human connections feel good and help us advance.\n\nHopke: That's always the best. And that's my hope for the clients that we get to work with in this space. That we can help them rethink DEI and their part to play in it in ways similar to how you are.\n\nIt's important to remember that DEI is not about finger-pointing or making anyone feel guilty, regardless of what some commentators or politicians might suggest. But it's about creating a more inclusive environment for everyone, and that can only be done when we create genuine experiences and spaces where everyone is heard, understood, and aligned around the purpose behind creating a more equitable world of work.\n\nWe have to clear the eggshells, take out the taboo around it, and ensure that people aren't coming to the table with fear or resentment but rather open hearts and minds that will ensure NO ONE (not even white men) is overlooked or excluded."

      "text": "Thinking Of God As A White Man Contributes To Bias Says New Study\n\nBy Kim Elsesser\n\nBy Kim Elsesser ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nMany depictions of God such as this one from The Creation of Adam, on the ceiling of the Sistine ... More Chapel portray God as a white man. (Photo by Art Images via Getty Images)\n\nIt's no secret that white men dominate leadership positions in the U.S., but a new set of studies suggest that conceptualizing God as a white man may contribute to the bias that favors white men in leadership positions. Researchers found that the more study participants thought of God as white and male, the more likely they were to think that white men made better leaders.\n\nAccording to the set of studies published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , how we picture God may impact how we think about race and gender. Not surprisingly, Christians in the United States are more likely to think of God as male than female. When it comes to race, the researchers found that white Christians tended to think of God as an old white man, and black Christians tended to conceptualize God as an old black man. The researchers also searched for \"God\" in Google Images. Of the images that were relevant to religion and depicted a humanized God, 87.5% depicted a white person, 74% depicted a man and 72% depicted a white man.\n\nNot only do images of God as a white man dominate many psyches and web searches, but conceptualizing God in this way also has an impact on who we think will be a good leader. Those who were more likely to think of God as a white man tended also to believe that white men were the best choice for supervisory positions.  This held true for male, female, black and white participants, and held even after controlling for racist and sexist attitudes, religiosity and political attitudes.\n\nStill, it's not clear from this study that thinking of God as a white man actually causes people to think white men are better fit for leadership.  In other words, the study doesn't demonstrate that our mental image of God directly impacts our thinking about who make the best leaders.\n\nBias On A Fictional Planet\n\nIn order to test if our conceptualization of God actually impacts our thoughts on leadership, the researchers started over with a fictional God on the imaginary planet, Zombot.  Planet Zombot, new study participants were told, was inhabited by two kinds of creatures called Hibbles and Glerks. Both Hibbles and Glerks believed that Liakbor the Creator had created Zombot, and both groups prayed to this creator. Study participants were told that Liakbor was a Hibble, and that both Hibbles and Glerks recognized that Liakbor was a Hibble. When these study participants asked which group should have the majority of leadership positions on Zombot, most said Hibbles should.\n\nWhat happens to these attitudes if the inhabitants believe that a god is of one race, but, in reality, that god is a different race? To test this, other participants were told that in reality Liakbor was a Glerk, but the inhabitants of Zombot didn't know this, and the inhabitants thought Liakbor was a Hibble. Participants in this case thought Glerks were best-suited for leadership. This is an important finding because it shows that the actual race of the god is more important than the general feeling about the race of the god in determining who is best suited for leadership.\n\nChildren May Be The Key To Reducing This Bias\n\nThese studies were replicated with children, indicating these connections start at a young age.  In the U.S., Christian children, both white and racial minority, thought of God as more white than black and more male than female. This resulted in the children perceiving white people as particularly boss-like. In the case of Zombot, agnostic preschoolers  (who said they had never heard of God) were told that Liakbor created Zombot and everything on it. The preschool children were then asked which group was more likely to rule on Zombot and live in a castle. The children chose the group that looked most like Liakbor, indicating that those who look like a creator are more suited for leadership.\n\nLead author of the study and Stanford psychology professor, Steven Roberts thinks kids may hold the key to addressing this problem, but it won't be easy.  \"The remedy seems to be to prevent children from even acquiring the God equals white male association. That is going to be a super difficult task because that image is pervasive and passionately defended. It really is a difficult problem and even some of the well-intentioned ministers I work with are scratching their heads as to how to fix it,\" he says.\n\nWomen face additional barriers to leadership inside the church that may also translate to perceptions of women's fitness for leadership outside the church. Many religious groups allow only men to be clergy , often citing The Bible as justification. For example, \"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet,\" from The New Testament, 1 Timothy 2:11 is often cited as a reason why women shouldn't hold leadership positions in church.  Although there are many different interpretations of this passage, it's not a stretch to think that those who believe this is true for the church, also are more likely believe it's true outside the church.\n\nThere is no simple solution to these issues. Beliefs about God and religion are deeply ingrained and attempts to change them can backfire. When the researchers showed a painting that depicted God as a black woman, respondents expressed disbelief and negativity. One African American woman who viewed the painting remarked, \"The artist is challenging the notion that #1 God is a man, #2 God is White. If I were at an art gallery and saw this painting, I would walk by shaking my head as it is just one more politically correct recreation of who God is. Disgusting!\""

      "text": "6 Steps Everyone Can Take To Become An Ally In White, Male-Dominated Workplaces\n\nBy Ethan Siegel\n\nBy Ethan Siegel ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAt the 89th Academy Awards in 2017, NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson (2nd L) appears onstage ... [+] with (L-R) actors Janelle Monae, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer. The actors starred in the movie 'hidden figures,' about the black women who helped the Apollo program successfully land and return astronauts on the Moon for the first time. Katherine Johnson, long cut out of the history she helped create, is finally receiving the recognition she richly deserves a half-century after her incomparable contributions. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\nIn some ways, it's true that life isn't fair for each and every one of us. But for those of us who are underrepresented in our chosen career field, the level of unfairness is greatly magnified. A large number of scientific, technical and academic professions - including computer programming, mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, etc. - are inordinately dominated at all levels (undergraduate, graduate school, early career, senior positions) by white males, far in excess of what one would expect if there were a level playing field.\n\nThe gender and racial disparities in these (and other) fields cannot be explained away by the \"inherent differences\" hypothesis . However, there are real, ubiquitous, and pervasive problems that disproportionately affect women, people of color, and all underrepresented minorities. This includes not only harassment, but many inappropriate behaviors that add up to send the toxic message of, \" you don't belong here .\"\n\nThankfully, more and more voices are speaking up to counter that message. Here are six steps that you can take to help.\n\nProtesters fill the street and pass the Space Needle during a women's march that brought tens of ... [+] thousands to Seattle in January of 2017, in support of women's rights and other causes.\n\nStep 0: You have to care . I know, it's not fair to say there are six steps and then to pull out a \"step 0\" to start, but this is to illustrate what I feel is an extremely important point: not everyone begins at the same starting line. When people with the same superficial attributes as you - particularly on the metrics of race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, language or religion - are not well-represented in your field, it's often assumed that you don't belong.\n\nPeople of color, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, members of the disability community, and many others are often given insufficient credit for their contributions to group projects, even when they're the principal investigator. They encounter a default assumption that they're junior, that they're less competent or knowledgeable, and that the white, male members of their collaboration are the only possible real contributors. People who have to fight underrepresentation on multiple fronts simultaneously (e.g., black lesbians with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) receive the \"you don't belong here\" message more strongly than anyone.\n\nIn 2011, the Boston's Museum of Science held the first national exhibition, RACE, to tell the ... [+] stories of race from the biological, cultural, and historical points of view. Combining these perspectives offers an unprecedented look at race and racism in the United States. The exhibit was developed by the American Anthropological Association in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota. (David L Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nIt should go without saying that these attitudes are harmful to everyone, as anytime a large number of qualified, intelligent researchers are pushed out of a field, it's not just those individuals but the entire scientific endeavor that suffers. In order to even get your foot in the door as an underrepresented minority (URM), you have to:\n\nPeople who are smart, talented, qualified, competent, interested and capable come in all shapes, sizes and colors. The playing field is not level. If you're interested in being an ally, you'll take steps to actively counteract the unfair inequities bred into the system. (And if you've read this far and determined you're not interested in being an ally, you can stop here. This article is not for you.)\n\nOne of uncountably many incidents that actually occur in the sciences on a near-daily basis that ... [+] illustrate how casually discriminatory attitudes can undermine and marginalize members of underrepresented groups.\n\nStep 1: Listen to (women/people of color/URMs) when they discuss the problems they face . This is the first real step towards being an ally, and all it requires you do to is pay attention to the many voices out there - especially the voices of people whose experiences are vastly different from your own - and pay attention to them.\n\nYou'll find lots of challenges that they talk about, and a myriad of ways that people are given the message that they are inadequate. This is a problem that practically everyone faces, but the degree of severity of this problem varies drastically among people of different races, genders, sexual orientations, religions, and ages. Many things that we think of as minor offenses if they only happen once or twice become unbearable, like death-by-a-thousand-papercuts, when they happen continually.\n\nOver a century ago, women experienced vastly different treatment than men in academic circles and ... [+] institutions. Here in 2019, the playing field is still far from level, although the reasons are far more insidious than overt these days.\n\nStep 2: Resist the urge to compare your own experiences with theirs . Yes, you have experienced unfairness in your life. You may have even - in many regards - experienced unfairness at a level where the injustices you've been forced to endure are greater than many of the underrepresented minorities you're expected to be an ally for. Your experiences, struggles, and injustices are your own, for sure, and no one should make you feel like your struggles aren't real.\n\nBut the very real adversities you've faced in your own life don't in any way invalidate the obstacles that people whose experience you don't share encounter. When someone shares their story about an injustice they've faced, you can either take the initiative to help, reach out to be supportive (and to ask how if you don't know), or simply let them know you have their back. Under no circumstances should you tell them that their experiences are wrong, untrue, invalid, or that they need to toughen up and get over it. And, as a bonus, try to never start a sentence with the words, \"well, actually...\"\n\n1927 Solvay Conference on Quantum Mechanics. Nearly everyone shown in this image has a Nobel Prize ... [+] to their name, and everyone except Marie Curie is a white man in physics.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that \"treating everyone the same\" can magnify, not erase, pre-existing inequalities . When I first got to college as an undergrad, I had a problem: my de facto instinct was to call all of my instructors \"Mr. or Ms. Name,\" rather than Dr. or Professor. I didn't intend any disrespect, but while the white male professors chuckled, the professors who were women or people of color were clearly grinning-and-bearing-it.\n\nWhy? Because even coming from an 18 year old student, that message of \"you don't belong here\" still rang in their ears in a way it didn't for the professors who were white men. Many prestigious colleges and universities will still default to sending invitations to \"Dr. Man and Ms. Woman\" to married couples who are both professors; many URM professors have to endure being casually lectured about their own areas of expertise.\n\nThere are small behavioral changes we can all make, as allies, to help mitigate the ways that the playing field isn't inherently level. By publicly treating URMs with the respect they're due, we can help instill the expectation that you cannot tell someone's competence or expertise by a cursory look at their appearances. By the same token, if we fail to recognize how URMs in our field experience their profession differently from our own experiences, we cannot begin to support them.\n\nHarassment and bullying of graduate students in academia is a rampant problem, and one that is ... [+] regarded as likely partially (if not wholly) responsible for the gender disparity at the highest professional levels in the sciences. This is a problem that will require action from the top to eradicate. If you're a prospective graduate student, talk to the other students to get a feel for how bad racism, sexism, and other discrimination/bigotry problems are for the students in your prospective department.\n\nStep 4: When you learn about one way that URMs experience inequality, look at your own actions . Are you actively working to counteract that inequality? How are you doing that? Is it effective in creating a welcoming environment for the URMs you're trying to support? Is there a way you can do that in a better fashion?\n\nWhen I first earned my Ph.D., it was a novel experience that some people called me \"Dr. Siegel,\" but I quickly found that it created an extra \"distance\" between myself and my students. So I told them to call me \"Ethan\" to put them at ease, and that was how I started living: everyone could call me by my first name and I could call everyone by their first name. Now that I had attained the highest educational degree possible in my own field, I wasn't being disrespectful to anyone.\n\nU.S. Department of Education Program Legal Group (Title IX), from the United States Department of ... [+] Agriculture. Although bullying and harassing behavior based on gender is explicitly forbidden, there are currently no punitive measures that are universally taken to enforce this legislation, and the unacceptable behavior is still widespread.\n\nThat was my thought, at least: a totally reasonable line of thought. Of course, my experience of getting the \"you don't belong here message\" was very different than that of URMs, and - in retrospect - one of my lowlights came about three years ago at an astronomy press conference. I was very interested in one of the presentations, given by a woman scientist in my field, and I casually referred to her by her first name, asked my questions, and got some wonderful knowledge out of it.\n\nBut this wasn't in private; this was in public. In front of dozens of other professionals in our male-dominated field, I addressed a woman scientist by her first name. In isolation, perhaps that would be no big deal, and maybe even today she doesn't think it was a big deal. But it's such a small behavioral change to just be a little bit thoughtful - to care enough about their experiences to change your own actions slightly - to give URMs in your field the respect that is so often withheld from them, and to recognize that the respect freely given to you may not be so freely given to them.\n\nThe three key points in the largest study of harassment in astronomy point to women of color ... [+] experiencing the largest amounts of gender and racial harassment, large levels among women and women of color specifically of feeling unsafe due to gender and race, and women skipping professional events due to feeling unsafe, leading to lost career opportunities.\n\nStep 5: When you witness someone in the \"in-group\" saying something unacceptable about women/PoC/URMs, speak up . One of the often-invisible obstacles faced by minoritized groups is the fatigue they face from the extra burden of having to endure the hurtful words and actions of bigots, harassers, and well-meaning but under-informed nincompoops. The following lines of question are common:\n\nYet every time such a question comes up, it places an enormous additional burden on the person - almost always an underrepresented minority in some form - solely on the basis of their minoritization in that field. If you are a non-minority in that field (or anywhere), and especially if you're already part of that conversation, do absolutely intervene. Why's that? The answer is in this last and final step...\n\nHealthy work environments where people of all races, genders, and religions can work together ... [+] productively and without bullying or harassing behavior occurring must become the norm. Anything less should be unacceptable. Here, the Mars SAM Team celebrates the perfect landing of their rover.\n\nStep 6: Don't stop striving to improve your allyship . Being an ally is not about doing the bare minimum. You cannot simply state, \"well, I don't think of myself as racist/misogynist/homophobic/bigoted, and therefore I'm part of the solution.\" Being an ally is all about supporting people who face additional challenges over and above and outside the experience of the ones you face, and that means continuously working to better support their success in your field, even if it means doing something that works against your own personal interest.\n\nSo say something when you see the older, male professor behaving in a sexually inappropriate way towards his junior, female students. Speak up about the existence of non-binary people when your coworker sees the options for \"gender\" under the drop-down menu as \"M,\" \"F,\" and \"other\" and laughs, even if there are no non-binary people (that you know of) in your workplace. And absolutely resist the urge to make the discussion about you; it isn't. It's about knowing what the right thing to do it, and doing it, in a world where not being an ally is a whole lot easier.\n\nYou won't get a gold star, a certificate, or any accolades for doing it. You may even receive derision for your efforts, along with accusations of grandstanding, white-knighting, or virtue signaling. Being an ally is about doing what's right at the individual level, at the department/workplace level, and for the entire field. The best part of it is that you can become one at any point in time, simply by making the decision that others - even those who have superficial features that differ from your own - deserve to be there just as much as you do. The joys and wonders of science are for everyone to enjoy and explore. It's up to us to make that message as inclusive as possible."

      "text": "Why The Next Jeff Bezos Won't Be A White Man\n\nBy Allyson Kapin\n\nBy Allyson Kapin , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover women entrepreneurs, startup culture, and social change.\n\nBy Allyson Kapin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 03: (L-R) MaC Venture Capital Co-Founder & Managing GP Marlon ... More Nichols and Redpoint Managing Director Annie Kadavy speak onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2019 at Moscone Convention Center on October 03, 2019 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch)\n\nIt's taking a literal revolution in the streets to push venture capitalists to more openly look at their portfolio of startups and admit that there's a distinct pattern in who gets access to funding and crowned the next big startup. The pattern, as we well know, is a near-homogenous stream of white men .\n\nSo much has been done to shine a light on this endemic issue that's been a barrier to anyone who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's mold of young white men who hold degrees from top-tier universities.\n\nYear after year, the severe lack of funding for diverse-led startups has been covered by nearly every major news outlet . It's been talked about at major tech conferences ; published in research showing the ROI of backing diverse founders; the issue has been at the center of advocacy campaigns launched by nonprofits . We've seen it trending in hashtags like #changetheratio and #femalefounders . It's inspired the launch of emerging funds by first-time fund managers, (including my own, the W Fund ) whose primary goal is to invest in diverse founders, because they understand the investment opportunity associated with these underfunded startups.\n\nAnd the list goes on. But why is all this evidence still not enough to see a real change reflected in startups that get the lion's share of funding?\n\nInvesting in diverse-led startups isn't about charity or altruism. Rather, this is about capturing an opportunity to back startups whose leadership understands untapped market needs. It's about creating the future of tech to solve its biggest problems while addressing society's structural issues in building economic power beyond the 1%. And it's about harnessing huge potential to generate high returns. In other words: It's also about money.\n\nVenture capitalists (VCs) and limited partners (LPs) have missed out on trillions of dollars by overlooking scores of founders of startups and emerging funds who are women, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, LGBTQ+, those over the age 50, immigrants, and others.\n\nAccording to Lo Toney, founder of Plexo Capital, \"We have enough reports from the Harvard's and the McKinsey's of the world to show us that diversity at all levels matters. \"\n\nToney is now on his second fund. To his point, plenty of data shows a strong ROI linking diversity in startup founders to generating better financial performances .\n\nCurrently, only 2.7% of VC investment goes to women-led startups. And of all VC funding over the past decade, Latinx women-led startups have raised only 0.32% while black women have raised only .0006%. This is all despite the fact that women drive  60% to 70% of consumer behavior in the US, and the data shows that startups led by women achieve a 35% higher return on investment, and, when venture backed, generate 12% higher revenue, according to the Kauffman Foundation . Black women founders and Latinx founders are the fastest growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the US; between 2007 and 2018, the number of Latinx women-owned businesses increased by 172% and the number of Black-women owned businesses rose 164% . According to First Round Capital's portfolio , companies founded by women outperformed companies founded by men by 63%.\n\nIn 2020, the new momentum by VCs to publicly discuss racial justice, the industry's systemic biases, and their own role in not doing enough to #changetheratio is a step in the right direction. But words and intention are meaningless unless backed up with action. We need to massively scale funding and support for diverse-led startups. We need to kick those closed doors and networks wide open.\n\nIf you're a VC, start those business processes to expand your pipeline ASAP. Assess the structures you've put in place to recruit and meet startups and take them through due diligence. Do these processes rely on criteria or channels that are biasing your systems to favor startups predominantly led by white men with specific backgrounds?\n\nTo increase your pipeline, have the most senior leadership (meaning the decision-makers) set up office hours devoted to meeting with founders who aren't in your usual network, or where you haven't had warm intros. This will provide you with more access to startups led by diverse founders. Then, close the deals and #sendthewire .\n\nIf you're an LP and want to increase your potential returns, start investing in emerging funds and fund managers who tend to have access to the most diverse pipeline of startups. Ask for a seat at their table.\n\nIf you're in tech, a startup founder with an exit, and/or have the ability and accreditation to invest, consider being an angel investor in early-stage startups or becoming an LP in an emerging fund. Help change the system within.\n\nDon't know where to start to find diverse-led startups or emerging funds? Happy to help. Here are a few resources to start with today:\n\nIf VCs and LPs are truly invested in forging a more equitable ecosystem with venture returns than they will start putting their money where their mouth is. We've seen too many social media campaigns, and too much evidence about who will drive a healthy financial future, to let this be a passing trend. We've started too many important conversations about the racial inequity in tech and startups to go back.\n\nHistorically, it's been in trying economic times like the present when we've seen the next crop of unicorns emerge. I believe (and exhaustive evidence supports the theory) that the next Jeff Bezos will be a diverse founder. Which VCs and LPs will capture the opportunity to invest in the next generation of startups?"

No, it's not New York City in the midst of a pandemic-caused shutdown. It was Mexico City on March 9 of this year experiencing a \"day without women.\"\n\n\"A day in Mexico without women would mean they couldn't go to school, couldn't go to work, couldn't buy anything at the supermarket or from their local vendors. They couldn't post on social media, use public transport, visit their relatives, or go to social gatherings. It was a day for people of all social classes to realize the value of women and young girls in society and their economic impact.\" That's how Karla Martinez described in Vogue magazine the next day.\n\nImagine if New York, or Chicago, or Louisville or Minneapolis-or any U.S. city- experienced \"a day without black people.\"\n\nMexico's day without women, from NPR story 3-6-2020\n\nThe entire city would come to a screeching halt. Even the Mayor's office in 10 of the largest cities, including Chicago, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. would stop.\n\nWithout black women and men, we would not have a country, or any buildings, or any infrastructure, or a functioning economy, or healthcare system, or schools.\n\nYet, black women continue to work seven more months than a white man to earn the same salary. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, the median salary for black women is 62% of what a white, non-Hispanic male earns. \" Even in states with large populations of Black women in the workforce, rampant wage disparities persist, with potentially devastating consequences for Black women and families.\" Because women of color earn so much less, they also have less savings to fall back on, which are the resources that might carry them through a crisis, such as a pandemic-economic shutdown.\n\nDo you think education is the answer? Think again. The median white male who didn't even finish high school is 70% wealthier than a black adult with some college (see image). That's unacceptable. Period.\n\nScreen shot of AAUW 2020 report on black women's earnings\n\nBlack women experience \"intersectional discrimination\"\n\nBlack women are the cornerstone of their families and communities. Yet, they are being squeezed on all sides economically - and even being killed by police or in their custody, as Breonna Taylor was while she slept in Kentucky.\n\nAs the American Association for University Women stated in their recent report, Black Women and the Pay Gap, \"Black women and girls live at the intersection of sexism and racism. While sexism and racism are distinct forms of discrimination that manifest differently, their effects are compounded when a person experiences both at the same time. Intersectional discrimination perpetuates the racial and gender wealth gaps, limits Black women's access to educational opportunities, and impedes their career advancement.\"\n\nAdd on to that the enormous job losses hitting women due to the pandemic-economic shutdown and the high quantity of black women risking their lives working in hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic.\n\nCenter for Am Progress article on pandemic economy, women of color, 4-23,2020\n\nThe largest gender-unemployment gap in history.\"\n\nThe largest gender-unemployment gap in history.\" Those are the words of Heather Long, economics reporter for the Washington Post in a recent article.\n\nWhen I spoke with her recently for my podcast , Green Connections Radio, she said unemployment for women is at 16.2% versus 13.5% for men. That means there are ~1 million more unemployed women than men, and it's much harsher for women because the service sector was hit harder than most and those are dominated by women, especially women of color. Unemployment for blacks is 16.7% and for Latinos, it's 18.9%\n\nEach of us has a role in this change\n\nThe protests erupting across the U.S. over the past few days triggered by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis are due to the systemic discrimination faced by people of color, especially black people, in this country since its founding and even before.\n\nFor the sake of all of us, our economy, our health and well-being, and every aspect of our lives, we must each do our own part to stop it, call it out, and implement structural solutions  immediately."

The only reason I got into college was because I worked very hard in high school and I got good grades, and then worked at night cleaning toilets in an office building to pay for it.\n\nSystematic racism may have existed 50 years ago, but the changes that have taken place in recent decades are immense-I believe it no longer exists. That is why I feel affirmative action is useless.\n\nWhile affirmative action may have had a place decades ago, I believe the civil rights legislation that we now have in this country means that the only people who benefit are incompetent people.\n\nIn my opinion, if you are a competent person who works hard you will have no problem getting a job or being admitted to a college. I feel all affirmative action is good for is helping people who are underqualified.\n\nAnd that's not a good thing for anybody. I have written various books about this subject, which have mostly had positive reactions, but occasionally I get people who say this is all a lie-that racism can only be committed by White people against ethnic minorities.\n\nBut I feel the tables have turned; that it's White people who are being marginalized and demonized.\n\nIn my view, the only way to achieve a truly equal society is to acknowledge that anti-White racism exists, because you can't fight against something until you're aware of it.\n\nI'm very disturbed when I hear about White people who fall for this whole thing and start asking for forgiveness for being White. I can't imagine forcing someone to apologize for their skin color. But that's going on, and has to stop.\n\nRacism is racism no matter who it's directed towards.\n\nEd Brodow is a political commentator and the author of The War on Whites : How Hating White People Became the New National Sport, released on May 24, 2023.\n\nAll views expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

      "text": "White Men Are Key to the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Conversation\n\nRon Carucci is co-founder and managing partner at Navalent, working with CEOs and executives pursuing transformational change.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWithin today's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, white men are often absent from the conversation. In one survey, 68 percent of white men said they didn't feel part of DEI efforts and conversations. Some felt they were seen as the problem. Others (64 percent) felt they didn't have the ability to speak candidly in conversations with colleagues from marginalized groups.\n\nBut given the wide representation of white men in positions of power in both the public and private sectors, we need to meaningfully engage them in the conversation to make real change. For example, of the 533 executive officers among the S&P 100, 70 percent are white men. In the public sector, despite representing only 30 percent of the population, white men hold 62 percent of elected offices. The group holding some of the greatest power to influence change are the ones most absent from the conversation about making it. Both our firsthand observations and the social sciences have shown us that when it comes to influencing white men to participate in conversations about racial equity and creating a more equitable world, a powerful place to begin is with their own experience of belonging.\n\nWe each come to this conversation from different perspectives. I, Zoe, as a Black scholar, researcher, and activist at Virginia State University, a historically Black University (HBCU). And I, Ron, as a white man working to understand how the privileges I have enjoyed simply because of my skin color and gender have led to the disadvantages others have suffered.\n\nI, Zoe, never thought I would be doing this work with white men. As a Black woman activist-scholar, I have studied, researched, and authored work on oppression in my own silo, with my own people. And while I thought I had mastered a cultural understanding of how oppression works, I found myself completely outside my comfort zone when exploring this work from the perspective of white men.\n\nBoth of us have invested a great deal of time in understanding the excessive ways people of color experience exclusion, microaggressions, withheld opportunities and harm. Particularly, we've been curious about the disproportionate role white men (often unwittingly) have played in perpetuating the unlevel playing field of privilege, and the outsized role they could play in creating a more equitable world. Three years ago, our paths came together as we'd both become part of a significant social experiment and community, now called White Men for Racial Justice (WMRJ)-Ron as a member of the community and Zoe as one of its equity advisors, along with Taylor Paul.\n\nSince its inception, more than 400 white men from across the U.S. have participated in this community focused on learning and unlearning through a disciplined weekly curriculum and community experience. The community was founded on two important premises.\n\nAs part of the DEI lexicon, \"belonging\" has sometimes devolved to simply mean that those from marginalized groups can find space in a bigger crowd. But the fact is, our social construct of racial and gendered identities guides how we perceive what belonging is or isn't. We've become conditioned to believe our belonging is intricately linked to our social identity. We seek reinforcement of that belonging from others who are like us.\n\nBut \"belonging\" isn't a verb-it's not something we can do to or for others. We can include others. But simply including people in otherwise exclusive spaces does not automatically produce inclusion. It's often experienced as \"doing them a favor,\" and it certainly won't lead to a sense of belonging.\n\nTrue belonging is a mutually deep connection between and among people, regardless of who they are. Those in a space of belonging have done the inner reflecting to know if they're self-editing, code-switching or conforming to the expectations of those who invited them in. When none of that feels necessary, then you've realized genuine belonging. Vulnerability feels safe, and the space is free of hierarchy; less concerned with class, gender or racial differences; and shared delight, dignity and care are norms. It's a purely human-to-human connection, not created for others, but co-created with others.\n\nTraditional gender stereotypes dictate that men will be rational instead of emotional, logical instead of intuitive, assertive instead of passive, strong instead of weak, doing instead of feeling. As a result, things like vulnerability, emotional expression and falling short of expectations are rendered socially unacceptable for them.\n\nThis combination of socially constructed expectations bears a significant influence on white men's isolation and recent surge in mental health challenges. Given the wealth, status and power they continue to control, empathy for them-much less the conscious choice to include them in conversations about marginalization of other groups-has understandably not been a common posture for many. But these cultural norms make it more challenging to get white men to embrace the vulnerability required for true belonging.\n\nFind belonging, strengthen allyship. If you identify as a white man and have privately wondered about how to effectively participate in conversations about equity and inclusion, and if you've felt the private hunger for greater levels of connection, here are some ways to begin.\n\nReflect on your socialization as a white man. Think about the narratives that underpin your understanding of what it means to be white and a man. What beliefs have you, consciously or unconsciously, held to? Adrian Gershom, a sustainability, impact and marketing executive and member of WMRJ, put it this way: \"Being a white man doesn't include a lot of opportunities for belonging because our understanding of masculinity means being conditioned to be self-sufficient. Being reliant on others is a sign of weakness. It's up to me to figure things out on my own.\"\n\nDo you privately battle feelings of inadequacy, fears of failure or not measuring up? Many socialized narratives like these create barriers to connection simply by conditioning white men to show up looking and sounding positive, put together and accomplished, but checking the rest of their humanity at the door. Take time to interrogate the belief structures that have defined those parts of your identity to see if they're serving you well.\n\nThink about your own experiences of exclusion. While the experience of white men and those from historically marginalized groups is not comparable, we've seen that when white men reflect on their own experiences of being marginalized, their empathy and compassion for others who experience it every day expands significantly.\n\nPerhaps you were bullied in school or rejected by clubs you wanted to join. Think about a time when you were excluded as \"other.\" What did it make you feel like? How did you respond? What do you imagine it's like to live with those feelings as a way of life?\n\nDarren Sudman, cofounder of the nonprofit Simon's Heart, a social impact consultant and member of WMRJ, put it like this: \"I remember the early years after my son died. Each Father's day, while others were preparing for celebrations and barbeques, I felt invisible.\"\n\nKnow where you go for \"faux belonging.\" Reflect on places in your life where you feel isolated, even when you're around other people. The social conditioning of many white men has created reflexive responses to reach for control, power and dominance when they feel uncomfortable.\n\nAdrian Gershom reflected on it this way: \"For me, belonging has been defined by a common experience, not a common need to connect. Faith communities, sports, social activities-things you did with people, not who you are with people. Places you could win, impress, posture. I've realized that I was envious of the belonging of others I didn't have. Seeing communities that don't enjoy the privileges white men do, I saw a network of support, common purpose, mutual care and cultural distinctions. I would look at communities of color and see the great care they offered one another. And privately I longed for that but had nowhere to get it.\"\n\nWhat substitutes have you chosen to meet a deeper need for connection? Do you inventory your wealth or achievements to feel important? Do you exert your will in heavy-handed ways? Do you turn to substances or experiences to push away the void?\n\nGet past your fears of being misjudged. Many white men have told us they fear talking about issues of equity, diversity and racism. They worry that they'll be seen as the \"bad guy\" or that their interest will be interpreted as insincere virtue signaling or a desire to be perceived as a white savior. Yes, that may happen. But it pales in comparison to what you'll discover about yourself, and the world, by simply finding a place to have real conversations about hard issues.\n\nDarren Sudman told us: \"Sure, I was concerned about what others would think of me being involved in this work. But I have always been deeply disturbed by anyone being left out. I've just never had a place to live out those values. Now I've found peers who are curious, compassionate and not afraid of discomfort. The reward on the other side of the discomfort is a strong sense of belonging and deep connections we've never experienced. Until I know how to belong, I can't understand how horrible it is to not belong, and how much I've caused others to not belong. But now that I'm learning to belong, I'm more empathic and caring to others who've been excluded, especially by me.\"\n\nDon't see opportunities for historically marginalized groups as your loss. It's common for some white men to feel resentful of opportunities their organizations are creating for underrepresented groups. They see those opportunities coming at their expense, triggering a sense of injustice and unfairness, but are fearful of expressing those feelings.\n\nIf you look deeper, the loss isn't necessarily just about one opportunity. It's the loss of how normal it was for most opportunities to be available to white men first-as has pretty much always been the case. These efforts are attempting to level the playing field. Your sense of loss is understandable, but if you'll look further out in time, you'll see the reward is a much more equitable world for everyone-white men included. The reality is that all of us are dehumanized by racial inequity. Being at the top of the proverbial food chain doesn't immunize you from the damage of systemic racism. The sooner we all start to help level the playing field, the sooner we all get to enjoy the fruits of equity.\n\nWe recognize that some people from marginalized groups may question why we're taking up more space to center those who have traditionally held power and dominance in society. True revolution isn't switching places with those who oppress us. It happens when belonging and love lead to everyone's freedom from the damage of racism, patriarchy and dominance. Therefore, the attention to white men's sense of love and belonging is even more necessary if we're going to see lasting change.\n\nBelonging is a deeply human experience. When genuine, it opens our hearts and minds to others in profoundly compassionate and empathic ways. When white men have this experience, it frees and empowers them to use the unique positions of influence they hold in the world to create spaces of true belonging for others.\n\nRon Carucci is co-founder and managing partner at Navalent, working with CEOs and executives pursuing transformational change.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA jury has ordered Novant Health Inc., a North Carolina-based not-for-profit health system, to pay $10 million to a white man who said the company wrongly fired him. The company replaced him with a white woman and a Black woman as a way to increase racial and gender diversity at the workplace, he said.\n\nThe company has pledged to challenge the ruling. It also said the ruling would not change its \"commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity for all.\"\n\nOn August 5, 2013, Novant Health Inc. hired David Duvall to serve as the company's senior vice president of marketing and communications. Then, on July 30, 2018, the company fired him without warning, he said in court documents.\n\nNovant's severance plan said that any executive terminated without cause would, \"under normal circumstances,\" receive 30 days' notice, Duvall's lawsuit stated. However, the company neither notified him of its decision beforehand, nor explained any abnormal circumstances that prevented it from doing so, he alleged.\n\nDuvall said he had exceeded his job's expectations and performed at a high level. After his firing, he was replaced by a white woman and a Black woman \"for the express purpose of increasing gender and racial diversity among Novant executives,\" his lawsuit said.\n\nDuvall's attorney, Luke Largess, said that his client's firing was a form of race- and sex-based discrimination. The jury agreed that Duvall's race and sex were motivating factors in the company's decision to terminate him, CNN reported. The jury awarded him $10 million in the case.\n\nThe company expressed disappointment over the verdict and pledged to challenge it, possibly through an appeal.\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN, Megan Rivers, Novant Health's director of media relations, noted that thousands of other organizations have \"robust diversity and inclusion programs, which we believe can co-exist alongside strong non-discriminatory policies that extend to all races and genders, including white men.\"\n\n\"It's important for all current and future team members to know that this verdict will not change Novant Health's steadfast commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity for all,\" Rivers added.\n\nLargess told the news outlet that his client was \"a strong advocate of diversity and inclusion\" at the company. Duvall was even part of an executive committee that provided support for the diversity initiative and had led a team that provided marketing to help boost the initiative.\n\n\"We believe the punitive damages award was a message that an employer cannot terminate and replace employees simply based on their race or gender in order to achieve targets for greater diversity in the workforce,\" Largess said.\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek , Largess said that Duvall wasn't the only person terminated in what he called \"a concerted effort in 2018 to remake the demographics of the leadership team.\"\n\n\"(The jury) saw the documents with the express goal and the timeline to implement the plan during 2018, and learned that his boss had 7 white male direct reports in Jan 2018 and then had 2 by Jan 2019,\" Largess told Newsweek .\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) received 22,064 complaints of race-based discrimination and 21,398 complaints of sex-based discrimination from workers, according to EEOC records. The complaints constituted over 64 percent of their total complaints filed by workers that year.\n\nNewsweek contacted Novant Health for comment.\n\nUpdate (10/29/2021, 8:40 p.m.): This article has been updated to include a statement from Largess.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "'I Saw White People as the Enemy, Then One Man Changed My Life'\n\nUser-generated content. Lightly edited.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nImagine that you're a slave in 1860s America. But on this particular day, June 19, 1865, a Union Army Major General Gordon forced your master to set you free ! You and your master probably heard about the Emancipation Proclamation two years earlier, but that didn't free you.\n\nSuddenly-you're free! Your emotions run the gamut. You and other former forced laborers are running around shouting and hugging everyone. But as your emotions subside, you begin asking yourself: \"What does being free mean?\n\nThink about what these former forced laborers experienced. They were freed, but had no job. They had been totally dependent on their slave master. Some immediately left their plantations hoping to find their families from whom they'd been separated. But most stayed exactly where they were.\n\nIn processing their newfound freedom, how would these former forced laborers and their families survive?\n\nFormer slave masters were also in a crisis. They couldn't maintain their plantations without these former slaves. Survival for former slaves and their masters created an interdependency for both. The business practice of sharecropping was birthed.\n\nSharecropping met a need for former slaves and slave masters due to the absence of cash or an independent credit system. It was not a fair system and some called it a new slavery.\n\nYet, in the midst of injustice, it seemed some former forced laborers became voluntary friends. Some astounding relationships have been discovered.\n\nBefore the Civil War ended, according to historian and abolitionist W.E.B. DuBois, there were some slaves willing to fight for the South to keep slavery. How could this possibly be? But it's true. Maybe some of these slaves were treated decently by their slave masters and were willing to fight for them. Others would have been forced to fight for the South.\n\nFredrick Douglass was a slave who became a voluntary friend to his former master, Thomas Auld. When they were reunited neither could stop themselves from crying. On his death bed, Auld told Douglass that he would have run away too. They recounted their lives, together and apart, according to an article by Erin Blakemore of History.com.\n\nTheir tears show they had some affection for each other, and I imagine this meeting was incredibly therapeutic for both. Before slavery ended, Douglass wrote that, after becoming a Christian: \"I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever.\"\n\nThere is a spirit of forgiveness that Blacks seem to have, even for their oppressors. This spirit of forgiveness produces sanity, direction, strength, and emotional freedom.\n\nStill, these friendships between people of different cultures or races seem so impossible. Yet, I'm reminded of meeting Gary Chapman, the New York Times Best Selling author of The Five Love Languages before he became famous.\n\nIt was in 1968 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The racial tension in this city with civil rights protests, the Ku Klux Klan, and Black Panthers brought out the National Guard. Segregation legally ended in 1964 but was still being practiced in Winston-Salem. This was similar to slavery being legally abolished in 1863 but still practiced in some parts of the United States until 1865.\n\nSo one evening as my best friend and I walked into a new gymnasium at a predominantly white church, we had concerns about our safety and how we would get home.\n\nI didn't expect to make a friendship with a white man. Whites were our enemy that constantly seemed to discriminate against us. Yet, Gary's and my friendship now spans fifty-four years. The then-youth pastor Gary approached me on the basketball court that evening. He introduced himself and said he was glad that I was there. His simple acts of courtesy made me feel welcomed and safe.\n\nHe was white, but I didn't think of him as white. My mind couldn't process it because he didn't act like most whites. Gary was nice.\n\nThe first time Gary drove into my neighborhood to pick up my friend James and I was almost the last time. We were walking toward him as he got out of his car and shouted: \"You boys ready to go?\"\n\nWe stopped in our tracks. James replied: \"I ain't no boy!\"\n\nGary immediately apologized and asked if we could discuss this word \"boy\" after the youth meeting, which we three then did for a couple of hours.\n\n\"If you two had been white,\" Gary said, \"I would have called you boys because of your age.\"\n\nWe listened to his perspective. Then, we shared how almost daily we saw white people call our adult dads boys. Our dads told us never to let white people call us boys.\n\nThe significance of that evening was that this white man wanted to hear us. He cared enough not to get defensive or quit. Instead, he embraced working through conflict. He treated us as equals with respect and dignity by listening and speaking to us.\n\nAfter that meeting, he could have called us boys because he now understood us. But he never called us boys again.\n\nAt times, I worried for Gary's safety, like the first time he invited me to his home. Neighborhoods were still segregated and the look his neighbor gave him scared me. I worried what some whites might do to him or his family.\n\nYears later, Gary shared that some whites didn't want me attending their church. One deacon asked: \"Why is he coming to our church?\" Gary answered: \"For the same reason I hope you are: To learn about God and the Bible.\" Someone else asked who is that Black dude. Gary replied: \"He's not a dude. He's Clarence.\"\n\nMy fondest memory to date is when my wife Brenda and I brought our twin baby girls to Winston-Salem for the first time. While waiting to be seated at a restaurant, Gary took my daughter Christina out of my arms and ran through the restaurant exclaiming to mostly white people: \"Look at my grandbaby!\" You should have seen the expressions of those white people looking at him. It was priceless.\n\nMuch like with those former forced laborers who befriended former slave masters, the extension of kindness had the power to change a worldview for people of different races in the midst of times of injustice.\n\nMeeting Gary Chapman changed my worldview so I saw that not all white people are bad. This relationship opened a door to embrace different cultures and races, resulting in the global friendships I enjoy today.\n\nMy life is so much richer due to many different friendships that span so many different cultures. Every Monday, I participate in a global call with people from Asia, Netherlands, Venezuela, America, and Europe. We all learn from each other and our time together is so enlightening.\n\nOne benefit of cross-cultural friendships is understanding. Understanding leads to patience with difference. What is needed in our country right now amidst our race tension is understanding and patience. This is one reason that inspired Gary and me to write our new book, Life-Changing Cross-Cultural Friendships: How You Can Help Heal Racial Divides, One Relationship at a Time .\n\nMany people want to do something to improve race relations in our country, but don't know what to do. Gary and I strongly believe one way to improve race relations in America is for all people to intentionally develop cross-cultural friendships.\n\nSo, as you celebrate Juneteenth this year, remember the spirit of the former forced laborers and how many of them became voluntary friends to others of a different culture or race.\n\nClarence Shuler is an author of 10 books, a speaker, diversity consultant, and the president and CEO of BLR: Building Lasting Relationships.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA group of white Canadian police officers have come under international scrutiny after security footage captured them lamenting that the \"white man's days are done.\"\n\nFootage of the unidentified Ottawa officers was posted to TikTok on Tuesday by Andrew Younis, who goes by @ttvbigdiscoenergy online. Captioned \"racist police pulled up to my black friend's house to harass him,\" the three white officers were unaware that they were being filmed on the man's home security system.\n\n#blm #defundthepolice #ottawa #canada_life🇨🇦 racist police pulled up to my black friends house to harass him. They didn't know they were recorded\n\nThe video starts mid-conversation between the cops, who appear to be standing inside the home's carport, with one boldly proclaiming, \"Our days are done, white man's day is done.\" The two other officers that \"he's probably right ... he's onto something.\"\n\n\"The population of North America, we're [white men] the minority I think, even at this point,\" the first officer claims. Another chimes in with the claim that \"if you put all the different groups together, North America would be majority non-white.\"\n\n\"You go to Toronto and every couple you see walking by is a mixed couple,\" the first cop alleges. \"You don't see white and white people together. It's white [and] Asian, white [and] East Indian.\"\n\nOne officer even says he encourages his son to \"find a Chinese or an Asian girl if he wants to stay in the mix.\"\n\nAdditional security footage posted on Thursday shows a white woman, who is said to be dating the homeowner, arriving and entering the house after talking with the officers, who tell her to bring the man outside.\n\n#blm #metoo #pig here we have the same officers who assume that interracial couples arebad accusing a hard working woman of \"being a dancer\"\n\n\"He didn't tell us that part, we would have come here faster!\" the first officer says after she enters the home. The three then hypothesize that the woman is a \"dancer.\"\n\n\"[I] will use that as leverage, if she doesn't come out I'll take her car,\" one officer says, seemingly referring to getting the couple to come out of the home and talk to them. Another cop says that the man in the house is probably \"tapping the keg one last time.\"\n\nYounis explained in a statement to Ottawa Citizen that he and his friend agreed to post the video online \"to raise awareness that this is happening in Ottawa.\"\n\n\"All I know is that cops were having inappropriate conversations at his place,\" he added.\n\nSince the original video has gone viral with over 57k views, the Ottawa Police Service has launched an internal investigation. In a statement to CBC News , a spokesperson said that \"such statements are not consistent with the values of the Ottawa Police Service and they have no place in the policing profession.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the intent, the comments expressed in the video have negatively impacted community members and service members,\" the representative added. \"The comments are offensive and they have further eroded public trust as well as internal morale.\"\n\nYounis told Ottawa Citizen that while the issue needed to be addressed, he does not believe the officers should be severely punished. \"I believe in reform: I believe the Ottawa police do an incredible job in the community,\" he said. \"l believe this is one person who is misinformed and needs guidance and needs help.\"\n\nViewers are divided about the comments the officers made. While some were appalled and found the conversation to be \"scary,\" others responded in their defense, with one going so far as to say, \"I ain't hear nothing wrong, and didn't hear a single negative opinion.\"\n\nLast month, a former California police officer was criticized for using racial slurs in a video taken during a car accident. While disciplinary action cannot be taken on the former detective, the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office are reviewing the 370 cases he handled.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWith the 2018 midterms over, speculation about the 2020 election is increasing.\n\nWhile discussing presidential prospects, CNN political analyst Harry Enten said a white male nominee might not be the best choice for Democrats.\n\n\"If you want to win in the Midwest, there may not be a better man than this guy,\" Enten said while talking about Senator Sherrod Brown, noting the Ohio legislator's success as Republicans dominated in the state's other races. \"So if Democrats want to play, this is an interesting guy for them. I will point out though, another white male. I am very suspect of that this year going into a Democratic primary with women doing well and the African-American face of the Democratic party, I am not sure it's the time to nominate a white man.\"\n\nThe analyst's list also included Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, among others.\n\nA number of women of color and progressive candidates won seats in the 2018 election, with some upending legislators who had long served.\n\nMassachusetts representative-elect Ayanna Pressley, who beat a ten-term incumbent during her primary, told large donors gathered for a Democratic National Committee fundraising meeting that they needed to support candidates of color.\n\n\"Now we must push ourselves to ask the tough questions about whether or not we provided them with the institutional support so we can break through more glass and concrete ceilings as rapidly as possible,\" she said, according to BuzzFeed News , which reported that Pressley also promoted the need for greater diversity among staffers.\n\nRashida Tlaib, the incoming representative for Michigan's 13th Congressional District, has for years called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to Jezebel . She interrupted Donald Trump during a 2016 speech in Detroit and earned the endorsement of the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter. Tlaib and Minnesota representative-elect Ilhan Omar are the first two Muslim women elected Congress.\n\nOmar ran on a platform that advocated for single-payer healthcare, debt-free college, criminal justice reform and the abolition of ICE.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, along with other lawmakers, has called for the \"Green New Deal,\" a plan that promotes shifting to cleaner energy forms while creating jobs.\n\nThe plan \"intends to push climate change, clean air and water, pollution and unhealthy environmental conditions in poor and minority communities to the forefront of the agenda of the new Congress that will convene in January,\" according to NBC News , which reported that \"Green New Deal\" supporters are also pushing legislators to stop taking contributions from fossil fuel companies.\n\nDaniel Moritz-Rabson is a breaking news reporter for Newsweek based in New York.

      "text": "White Men's Electability Advantage is a Myth | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nGoogle the word \"electable\" right now, and you'll get nearly 800,000 hits. The historically diverse field of presidential candidates is driving endless speculation over who is and isn't \"electable,\" a term loaded with presumptions about the popularity of white male candidates with voters.\n\nBut being a white man actually gets you zero advantage at the polls. After analyzing how race and gender played out in the 2018 general election, those of us at the Reflective Democracy Campaign found that when they're on the ballot, women of all races and men of color win as often as white men do. In the 2018 election, women of color were 4 percent of candidates and 5 percent of winners. Men of color were 6 percent of candidates and 7 percent of winners, while white women were 28 percent of candidates and 29 percent of winners.\n\nIn fact, the only demographic to dip slightly was white men, who were 61 percent of candidates and 60 percent of winners. While they inarguably dominate politics-at 30 percent of the population white men hold 62 percent of local, state and federal elected offices-it's not because they're more electable.\n\nPundits and political gatekeepers still buy (and sell) the myth of white male electability, so the structural barriers to women and people of color running for office stay in place. U.S. politics has always been awash with white men. They used to have the field to themselves, so, of course, they won a lot of elections.\n\nThe gatekeepers choosing candidates are mostly white men too, and in that echo chamber of party bosses and major donors, candidates who aren't white men look risky and unfamiliar. The political status quo is white men making decisions, and the rest of us choosing which white men get to make them. The electability myth protects the current system, and for that reason alone it's hard to dislodge.\n\nEach time we survey voters, a bi-partisan majority wants leaders who better reflect America's diverse population, and in 2018, women of all races made astonishing gains at the polls. Forty-seven states added more women state legislators, and women's headcount in Congress grew by 21 percent. Men of color also made modest gains, though in the #metoo era, it is women doing the heavy lifting in shifting the demographics of political power.\n\nYou can also safely ignore the claim that executive office is different, and voters only trust white men in that role. Our research found that women's share of statewide executive offices like governor, attorney general and treasurer has increased by 57 percent since 2015. In 2018 alone, we elected five of our nine female governors in office.\n\nOnce you know the truth, it's hard not to notice how the electability myth-a powerful relic from a time when only white men were considered viable candidates, a belief openly reinforced by a panoply of racist and misogynist tropes-shapes our political landscape today. The persistent assumption that the safest path to victory is a white man pops up daily in new reports and commentaries, shaping our perceptions and anxieties about the 2020 election.\n\nHere is permission to let it go: Your candidate, be it a woman of any race, a white man, or a man of color, is no more or less likely to win based on their demographic profile. Lots of factors are at play in every election. But the greater electability of white men? That's not one of them.\n\nBrenda Choresi Carter is the Director of the Reflective Democracy Campaign.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA white man who refused to wear a mask while approaching the outdoor ordering counter at a restaurant was recorded cursing at a restaurant employee and hurling the N-word at someone standing nearby.\n\nThe video began going viral after it was posted on Reddit Tuesday. The person who shared the video said in the comments on the post that the incident took place at a Dick's Burger joint in Kent, Washington.\n\n\"It's worth arguing about a mask right here. Look at this guy,\" the person recording the incident can be heard saying while approaching the man. The man was pointing and gesturing at an employee on the other side of the ordering counter's window.\n\n\"I don't need one,\" the man can be heard saying. \"I'm within six feet of you, dumba**.\"\n\n\"The guy's just trying to do his job, man,\" the person recording the incident called out. The man continued cursing at the employee and started walking away before the person behind the camera yelled, \"Hey, Trump 2020, am I right?\" The man then approached the person who was catching the incident on video, cursing at him, pointing his middle finger and using the N-word before the video ended.\n\nA flood of Reddit users mocked the reference to the president's re-election bid in comments posted within the feed. Trump's own refusal to wear face coverings in most public appearances set a political tone for the debate about where and when to use masks, despite the fact that many state and federal health officials-including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommend them whenever individuals are unable to observe six feet of social distancing.\n\nAccording to Jasmine Donovan, the president and chief financial officer of the restaurant chain, the company has encouraged its employees and customers to wear face coverings for months.\n\n\"Since the COVID crisis began in Washington we've been making modifications to our operations for the safety of our crew, our customers and our communities,\" Donovan told Newsweek . \"All of our employees have been wearing masks since the end of April and have been encouraging our customers to do so as well. The vast majority of our customers have been patient, understanding and supportive of the changes we've made for everyone's safety.\"\n\nThe CDC recommended Americans wear masks in early April, but several states began mandating their use in public spaces last month in response to surges in new COVID-19 cases. In Washington, where one of the country's first COVID-19 outbreaks took place, Governor Jay Inslee issued an executive order that required all residents to wear face coverings in both indoor and outdoor public settings. The order went into effect June 26.\n\nAlthough Inslee and several other governors ordered their constituents to wear masks while in public, others have not issued statewide declarations, instead allowing local government leaders to dictate rules regarding masks and other pandemic restrictions. While the CDC still recommends Americans wear face coverings, the federal government has not taken steps to tighten the guidelines further. The changes in requirements from one county to the next has caused confusion among many Americans about what the rules are and when they apply.\n\nThere has also been confusion about what qualifies as a face covering. Shortly after Inslee's mandate went into effect last month, an argument over face coverings broke out at a Cold Stone in a town about 130 miles away. In that instance, the Cold Stone employee was fired after a customer accused her of discriminating against children in connection to the store's own policy, which the employee said was stricter than Inslee's broad face-covering definition.\n\nUpdate, July 15, 2020, 5:59 p.m.: This article has been updated with a statement from Jasmine Donovan, the restaurant chain's president and CFO.\n\nMeghan Roos is a Newsweek reporter based in Southern California.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe video is like many on Facebook Live -- the picture is grainy, the sound sometimes distorted, but a moment between a Black protestor and a white man went viral anyway. But unlike some other videos, this one sparked a conversation about forgiveness and acceptance.\n\nThe initial encounter happened Tuesday in Waukegan, Illinois as a group of people waited for President Donald Trump to arrive at the Waukegan National Airport before visiting Kenosha, Wisconsin and tour buildings damaged in protests and riots following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nBroadcast via livestream, the conversation between Clyde McLemore, who is Black, and Gary Lloyd, who is white, involved Trump, war and America's freedom. In the video, McLemore holds a 'Black Lives Matter' sign and wears a matching t-shirt. He can be heard saying, \"we ain't won a war yet,\" followed by his disapproval of the president.\n\nIn response, Lloyd replies, \"If you don't like it, why don't you go back to Africa and see how nice it is there?\"\n\nThe video quickly made the rounds across social media. As of publication time, the viral moment was viewed over 550,000 times across various platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. McLemore's Facebook Live alone has over 1,600 comments.\n\nMcLemore told Newsweek that the overwhelming support he got after the incident, from both Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters, was reassuring, but the matter still left him feeling discouraged. \"I felt really bad because I thought, this is 2020. 'Go back to Africa,' for real? Of all the days?\" he said.\n\nLloyd, a Vietnam veteran who owns a construction company in Lake County, said he's \"not a racist person\" but grew angry when McLemore started speaking against U.S. involvement in wars.\n\n\"I was very upset when he was tearing up our country,\" Lloyd told Newsweek in a separate phone call. \"So that's why I said what I did... I got angry and I lost my temper, but I never should have said it.\"\n\nMcLemore, 61, is a former contractor at the local jail, running a transitional program to help former inmates transition back to a normal environment. He is also the founder of the Black Lives Matter Lake County chapter and hosted various communal efforts for the cause, including food and water donations to communities in need and renting out movie theaters for local children to view Black Panther when it premiered in 2018. The Lake County BLM chapter opened its first office in downtown Waukegan last month.\n\nIt was the next day that Lloyd set out to talk to McLemore.\n\n\"I didn't go to him because I was worried. I just know that's not part of me, it's really not me to say something like that,\" said Lloyd. \"That's why I had to ask for his forgiveness. So I could just go on with my life.\"\n\nZakee Darr, the president of the Lake County BLM organization, said he noticed a white man walking in circles outside of the office on Wednesday. Darr was concerned at first, but when the man approached him, he asked if he could speak to McLemore to apologize.\n\n\"He came up to the office and he said, 'Man, I'm gonna tell you. I don't know why I said that.' He said, 'Please accept my apology,'\" McLemore said of Lloyd. \"There was something about the sincerity in his eyes that led me to believe that he was honest. He came and found us because we were a brand new office.\"\n\nMcLemore said that he and Darr took the opportunity to educate Lloyd on the Black Lives Matter movement and what the cause supports. McLemore said he also gave Lloyd a copy of his organization's bylaws and core principals.\n\n\"He didn't know a lot about Black Lives Matter. He thought we were the ones up there in Kenosha, setting fires and all of that. But after visiting our office and going through everything,'\" McLemore said.\n\nLloyd echoed McLemore's comments, telling Newsweek that \"he was letting me know that Black Lives Matter wasn't doing all of this destroying the property. People are coming from all over the country and they're doing this and it's not them. And so it gave me a whole different way of looking at things.\"\n\nLloyd asked McLemore and Darr to pray with him, which McLemore said it was an \"intimate\" moment and one that touched him deeply. \"He asked God to forgive him in his prayer, and that was so unique. He didn't pray to God to forgive me or for me to accept his apology. He asked God to forgive him,\" he said.\n\nThe meeting was captured in a series of pictures, with Lloyd holding a \"Silence is Violence\" sign provided to him by the organization. McLemore posted the photos on his Facebook page, the same feed that, just a few scrolls down, shows the initial exchange between the two men.\n\n\"I mean, I read all the comments of people telling me, 'Don't trust him,' but we have to start somewhere,\" he said. \"And maybe this was a turning point.\"\n\nLloyd said he \"got to know\" McLemore in the hour the two men spent together, and that their conversation helped him to \"understand where they're coming from.\"\n\n\"We had a great talk about that, and I can see why they're going out doing what they're doing to try to stop this stuff. And I think the police force needs to step back and look at what they're doing too,\" Lloyd said.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

The progressive activist fixation on identity-race, gender, etc.-is not broadly popular, even among left-of-center Americans. The demonstrations of performative wokeness that are part and parcel of life on college campuses seem alien (and alienating) to just about everyone else. When progressives push the Democratic Party to be more consciously identitarian, they arguably make it more unpopular among a swath of gettable voters who are turned off by these kinds of appeals. But, most importantly, the voters who are expected to be enthused by the appeals to racial identity-people of color-don't care nearly as much as the undergrads at Middlebury , Oberlin , and Reed College .\n\nThis poll brings to mind a previous survey result from the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank, which similarly found that a majority of minority respondents expected to take offense at various microaggressions weren't actually bothered by them.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The progressive activist fixation on identity-race, gender, etc.-is not broadly popular, even among left-of-center Americans. The demonstrations of performative wokeness that are part and parcel of life on college campuses seem alien (and alienating) to just about everyone else. When progressives push the Democratic Party to be more consciously identitarian, they arguably make it more unpopular among a swath of gettable voters who are turned off by these kinds of appeals. But, most importantly, the voters who are expected to be enthused by the appeals to racial identity-people of color-don't care nearly as much as the undergrads at Middlebury , Oberlin , and Reed College .\n\nThis poll brings to mind a previous survey result from the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank, which similarly found that a majority of minority respondents expected to take offense at various microaggressions weren't actually bothered by them.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "This UPenn Teacher Justifies Her Refusal to Call on White Male Students: It's 'Progressive Stacking'\n\nCampus Free Speech\n\nRobby Soave | 10.21.2017 2:30 PM\n\nNo, this isn't a Clickhole story; if you're a white man in Stephanie McKellop's history class, you might be called out , but you probably won't be called on .\n\nMcKellop, a graduate instructor at the University of Pennsylvania who describes herself as a \"queer disabled feminist,\" recently tweeted, \"I will always call on my Black women students first. Other POC get second tier priority. WW [white women] come next. And, if I have to, white men.\" McKellop eventually deleted the tweet, but not before the internet immortalized it .\n\nBret Weinstein, the former Evergreen State College professor who was hounded by student-activists for criticizing their protest tactics, described McKellop's teaching method as \"racism,\" and \"vile.\" The usual conservative news sites have piled on .\n\nInside Higher Ed ran a news story suggesting that McKellop's teaching method isn't exactly discrimination-it's \"progressive stacking,\" a widely accepted teaching tool:\n\nJessie Daniels, a professor of sociology at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said progressive stacking has been around at least since she was in graduate school in the 1990s. She still uses it informally, to right her own tendency to call on men more frequently than women.\n\n\"If I have a class of 40 students, since Hunter is predominantly young women, I may have four or five young men in class,\" Daniels said. \"There's still implicit bias, where we value men's voices more than women's voices, or men's voices are deeper and carry more in a class. So I'm always trying to overcome my own bias to pick on men in class more than the women.\"\n\nAs to whether purposely asking a woman to answer a question over a man was a kind of discrimination, Daniels said, \"That gets it the wrong way around. This is a way of dealing with discrimination that we as professors can introduce into the classroom. It's a good strategy, if you can do it.\"\n\nIt seems more like a way of practicing discrimination. Even if you think social inequalities make it impossible to be racist against white people, McKellop's contention that \"other POC get second tier priority\" is absurdly offensive on its own.\n\nIf professors have biases against marginalized students, they should strive to overcome them by calling on more students of color, and encouraging students of color to participate. If McKellop had simply said, I go out of my way to call on students who are less likely to participate, in order to make sure a more diverse range of students are receiving equal attention in class , there would be no problem. Instead, McKellop admitted to practicing active discrimination against students on the basis of their skin color.\n\nMcKellop has claimed her classes were cancelled for the week, she could be kicked out of her program, and the university is investigating her. Inside Higher Ed 's sympathetic report was forced to concede that at least some of this isn't true: a spokesperson for the university said she has not been removed from her program. Administrators are indeed investigating the matter, however.\n\nMcKellop shouldn't be punished for expressing an opinion on Twitter. I'm no fan of lynch mobs against professors, and no one should ever be subjected to harassment or threats for saying the wrong thing-whether the \"wrong thing\" is politically correct or politically incorrect. But Penn has every right to make sure its instructors are not engaged in overt racial discrimination with respect to how they treat their students. Perhaps the dean of McKellop's department should remind her that she can't just ignore the white guys in her classroom.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Race Discrimination/Harassment Lawsuit Against Seattle Related to Its \"Race and Social Justice Initiative\" Thrown Out\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 2.10.2025 7:59 PM\n\nFrom Judge Jamal Whitehead's opinion today in Deimert v. City of Seattle (W.D. Wash.):\n\nIt is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee because of their race. Recognizing the stubborn and pernicious effect of racism against minorities, many employers have adopted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\"D.E.I.\") initiatives to combat discrimination and harassment in the workplace.\n\nPlaintiff Joshua Diemert, a white man, alleges that his employer, Defendant City of Seattle (\"City\"), discriminated against him because of his race. He argues that the City's Race and Social Justice Initiative (\"RSJI\")-the City's D.E.I. program-created a hostile-work environment by \"infusing race into all City functions\" and \"reduc[ing] [him] to an embodiment of his race.\"  He also alleges the City retaliated against him when he opposed the supposed harassment.\n\nControlling precedent makes clear that the legal protections against workplace discrimination apply with equal force regardless of the plaintiff's race. Yet we must acknowledge what history and common sense tell us: instances of discrimination against the majority are rare and unusual. Diemert does not present that rare and unusual case here. Contrary to his claims, D.E.I. programs aimed at addressing racial inequalities against Black people and other minorities are not by their very nature discriminatory against whites. And while it is apparent that Diemert personally rejects the RSJI, as is his right, the details he alleges about its discriminatory effect are not so objectively severe or pervasive as to create a racially hostile-work environment against white people in general or him in particular. The same is true about the sweeping claims Diemert makes about his co-workers' and supervisors' alleged race-based conduct, which lack specificity and factual support. Put plainly, more is required of Diemert under the law to demonstrate an unlawful hostile-work environment.\n\nBecause Diemert's claims do not stack up against the time-honored tests for proving unlawful employment discrimination and retaliation, the Court must grant the City's summary judgment motion and dismiss Diemert's case.\n\nThe opinion is over 12,000 words long, and I can't fully analyze it now; you can read it its entirety here . But here's a short excerpt that rejects Diemert's claim that the initiative created a racially hostile environment for him:\n\nDiemert argues that the \"City's [RSJI] ... la[id] the foundation for all the racial harassment ... [he] would face.\" It's clear that Diemert found RSJI messaging incorrect and offensive: he testified that he believes white privilege does not exist and is an \"incorrect stereotype\"; that it is offensive to state that the United States was built on a system of white supremacy; and that it is offensive to state that it is not appropriate to be color-blind when it comes to race. But the Court rejects the notion that the RSJI and programs like it are inherently racist, as Diemert suggests.\n\nThe claim that efforts to address racism in the workplace-such as D.E.I. initiatives-are themselves racist presents a striking paradox. According to their proponents, these programs aim to promote fairness and inclusion by acknowledging and addressing racial disparities-they are designed to ensure that all individuals have access to opportunities. Critics, however, argue that explicitly focusing on race or addressing racial inequalities perpetuates division and unfairness. For them, the cure is worse than the disease. The tension between these views underscores the complexity employers face when talking about race and equity.\n\nWhile such conversations may prompt discomfort or spark debate, they do not necessarily violate anti-discrimination laws. Multiple courts in recent years have reached the same conclusion. Quite the opposite, many courts have held that anti-discrimination trainings play a vital role in preventing workplace discrimination. The Supreme Court has held that Title VII's \"primary objective was a prophylactic one.\" Trainings, courts have recognized, further Title VII's primary goal. Indeed, in line with Title VII's \"basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers,\" the Supreme Court crafted the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense, allowing employers to avoid liability for supervisory harassment by taking a proactive approach to harassment prevention, including by implementing training. These training programs are needed because racial discrimination and inequality are present-day problems, not problems of the distant past. Against this backdrop, the real threat to equality in the workplace is not the effort to expose and address racial inequalities, but a resistance to doing so.\n\nBecause the Court finds that D.E.I. and anti-discrimination trainings are not per se unlawful, Diemert's belief that such trainings constitute an illegal employment practice is viable only if he shows that the RSJI trainings-in content, implementation, or context-harassed him personally on account of his race. Diemert makes sweeping allegations about the effect of the RSJI, but as explained below, he is short on details about how it transformed his workplace into a racially hostile environment for him and other white people.\n\nFor instance, Diemert argues, \"[t]he City designed the RSJI as a policy and system that would 'lead with race,' 'center People of Color,' 'de-center whiteness,' and 'prioritize the leadership of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.'\" He takes issue with a definition of \"white supremacy\" culture provided in RSJI materials, which states among other things that \"[t]he culture of white supremacy perpetuates the belief and legitimizes the practice of treating people of color as inferior and white people as superior.\" He argues that he was not the only white employee who found the RSJI trainings to be \"divisive\" to the extent they \"focus on our differences vs. on our similarities[.]\" Beyond these general critiques, he provides no other details about the content of the RSJI trainings....\n\nRSJI trainings no doubt contained statements about race. But exposure to material that discusses race does not by itself create an unlawful hostile-work environment. \"Training on concepts such as 'white privilege,' 'white fragility,' implicit bias, or critical race theory can contribute positively to nuanced, important conversations about how to form a healthy and inclusive working environment.\" But Diemert equates acknowledgement of institutionalized racism and implicit bias-concepts recognized by many courts- with personal attacks. Not so. Passive exposure to these concepts cannot reasonably be construed as a threat to Diemert's safety or well-being or an impediment to his job. Put differently, these trainings in no way interfered with the terms and conditions of Diemert's employment. Comparing diversity trainings that use terms like \"'racial bias,' 'white man's privilege,' and 'white man's guilt,' and address topics such as systemic racism, oppression, and intersectionality ... to true hostile work environments ... trivializes the freedom protected by [antidiscrimination laws].\"\n\nOn this record, a reasonable juror could not find that the RSJI created an objectively hostile-work environment. Whether comments made by Diemert's co- workers and supervisors created an actionable hostile-work environment is a different inquiry that the Court explores below....\n\nDiemert alleges that comments made by his co-workers during the RSJI trainings and at other times subjected him to a hostile-work environment. Diemert points to a collection of statements over the years:\n\nWhether this conduct amounts to severe or pervasive racial harassment from which a reasonable juror could conclude Diemert's work environment was objectively hostile depends on the circumstances. This is because \"'[n]ot every insult or harassing comment will constitute a hostile work environment.'\" \"'[S]imple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious)' will not trigger Title VII's protections.\" \"The standard for judging hostility is meant to 'ensure that Title VII does not become a 'general civility code.'\" And \"properly applied, this standard 'will filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.'\"\n\nDiemert's allegations fall short of the mark. The Ninth Circuit has deemed much harsher comments and conduct not enough to create a hostile-work environment. See e.g. , id. (no hostile-work environment when employer told male plaintiff that he was \"in a female job related environment,\" suggested plaintiff should \"look for other employment in cooking in the future,\" and told plaintiff he \"might want to do something with cooking for work.\"); Henry v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. , 644 F. App'x 787, 788-89 (9th Cir. 2016) (no hostile-work environment when \"noose incident\" was deemed an \"isolated incident[ ]\" and when plaintiff failed to show \"racial motive behind the noose ... or that the noose was directed at him personally.\"); Harris v. Sutton Motor Sales & RV Consignments Corp. , 406 F. App'x 181, 182-83 (9th Cir. 2010) (no hostile-work environment when plaintiff was called a \"nigger\" two or three times in the same year); Vasquez v. Cnty. of Los Angeles , 349 F.3d 634, 638 (9th Cir. 2003), as amended (Jan. 2, 2004) (no hostile-work environment when plaintiff was accused of having a \"typical Hispanic macho attitude\" and told he should take a job in the field because \"Hispanics do good in the field.\"); Manatt v. Bank of Am., NA , 339 F.3d 792, 795 (9th Cir. 2003) (no hostile- work environment when Asian plaintiff overheard her coworkers laughing and saying \"China Man,\" pulling \"their eyes back with their fingers in an attempt to imitate or mock the appearance of Asians,\" and referring to plaintiff as \"China woman.\"); Kortan v. Cal. Youth Auth ., 217 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir. 2000) (no hostile-work environment when a supervisor called female employees \"bitches,\" \"castrating bitches,\" \"Madonnas,\" \"histrionics,\" and \"Regina\" in the plaintiff's presence.); Sanchez v. City of Santa Ana , 936 F.2d 1027, 1031-36 (9th Cir. 1990) (no hostile-work environment when employer posted a racially offensive cartoon, made racially offensive slurs, targeted Latinos when enforcing rules, provided unsafe vehicles to Latinos, did not provide adequate police backup to Latino officers, and kept illegal personnel files on plaintiffs because they were Latino). The objective severity of the comments alleged by Diemert pales in comparison to that of the statements and conduct in these cases.\n\nThe context in which statements are made also matters. At least some of the comments that Diemert takes issue with were made during RSJI trainings. Racially charged comments made in this setting, while still potentially harmful, are better framed as attempts to express perspectives or challenge ideas within the training's scope. Such comments made in the presence of a skilled facilitator can be addressed constructively, turning the moment into a learning opportunity, not a personal attack. This is very different than comments made, for example, on a production room floor that serve no educational purpose.\n\nEven viewed cumulatively, comments about Diemert being a \"colonist\" or \"white people being cannibals\" were too infrequent to surpass the type of \"joking or teasing [the Ninth Circuit] [has] held to be part of the ordinary tribulations of the workplace.\" ...\n\nFor a different result, though of course on different facts, see Judge Wendy Beetlestone's opinion in De Piero v. Penn. State Univ. (E.D. Pa. 2024) ; for Judge Whitehead's earlier opinion in allowing Diemert's claim to go forward at an earlier stage of the proceedings, see here .\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Robin DiAngelo Is Very Disappointed in the White People Making Her Rich\n\nRacism\n\nMatt Welch | 7.1.2021 7:00 AM\n\nWe are, especially here in Brooklyn, living in Robin DiAngelo's world. And yet she seems so unhappy about it.\n\nThe five-minute walk to my neighborhood bookstore to buy DiAngelo's new book Nice Racism: How Progressive White People Perpetuate Racial Harm is filled with totems signaling the continued ascendancy of the self-styled anti-racist movement.\n\nA window on my block bears the hand-scrawled sign \" INACTION = CONSENT ,\" a Manichean formulation that DiAngelo echoes throughout her follow-up to the 2018 smash hit White Fragility (\"if we are not actively challenging those [racist] structures, we are supporting them,\" etc.). The storefront of my local State Assembly representative's office displays not one but three Black Lives Matter signs. Across the street, the fence of my youngest's elementary school is festooned with student art condemning discrimination and celebrating diversity. That school recently shrunk its zone (my house, 150 feet away, is no longer in it) and changed admissions policies in an effort to \"disrupt zones of exclusion.\" And just past the bookstore is my eldest's much more diverse middle school, more famously known now as the subject of the New York Times podcast Nice White Parents , whose sardonic, guilt-encouraging title likely influenced DiAngelo's latest.\n\nThis movement's journey from obscurity to ubiquity has been neck-snappingly brief-and measurably lucrative for its leading lights. \"My average fee for an event in 2018 was $6,200,\" DiAngelo writes on her website's \" Accountability \" page. \"In 2019, it was $9,200. In 2020 (as of August), it has been $14,000.\" In the book, she adds that she gives presentations on \"whiteness and white fragility\" on a \"weekly basis.\"\n\nTaking those numbers at face value, that's $728,000 a year just from speeches and workshops, to say nothing of book royalties and whatever the University of Washington is paying her. By most every yardstick, DiAngelo has achieved runaway success, lodging herself firmly in the top-earning 1 percent of the world's richest country .\n\nBut Nice Racism is an unrelentingly sour book, depicting the fight against systemic oppression as a joyless, never-ending slog through minefields of potential missteps, while relying to a comical degree on DiAngelo's exasperated encounters with people who have the temerity to disagree with her approach.\n\nThat latter description may sound uncharitable, but it's not. In a chapter titled \"We Aren't Actually All That Nice,\" DiAngelo belatedly berates a (white male) London cab driver for telling her that he was sick of being called a racist and that he feared a group of black men who hung around his neighborhood. \"Also worthy of note was his typical white lack of racial curiosity or humility about the limits of his knowledge,\" she snipped. \"He had the author of a New York Times best-selling book who was in town to do interviews for the BBC in his cab, and he did not ask a single question about my thoughts on the matter.\" The nerve!\n\nIf you are a white person who has challenged DiAngelo in one of her seminars the past couple of years, you are probably in this book. There's \"Sue and Bob,\" who reacted to her eight-point talk on \"What's Problematic About Individualism?\" by telling her that, no, they prefer treating people as individual human beings. \"How could Sue and Bob have missed that forty-five minute presentation?\" she huffed. \"I was left wondering, yet again, what happens cognitively for so many white people in anti-racism education efforts that prevents them from actually hearing what is being presented.\"\n\nThere was \"David,\" a white man who-after being asked to disclose his racial identity-chose an indigenous tribe he had just spent a few months living with. (\"David held fast to his opening claim, which had a powerful impact on the seminar and which continued to direct our efforts and distract the group.\") There was a white woman who complained that a DiAngelo-led webinar was not \"advanced\" enough for those who'd been doing such work for years. (\"This move demonstrates an inability to think strategically about our own role in anti-racist endeavors.\")\n\nThen there were the white progressive participants of one presentation who, even after being told that \"silence from a position of power is a power move,\" nonetheless declined DiAngelo's urgings to speak aloud about their experiences of \"white socialization,\" and then complained afterward. \"Given that in the case of racism, the worst fear of most white progressives is that they be perceived as racist, and both myself and the BIPOC people in the room gave them direct feedback that the effect of their silence was racism, how could they continue to hold back? What was going on?\"\n\nWhat indeed?\n\nThere's a palpable anxiety gnawing near the heart of DiAngelo's project, one that gives me a bit of hope in our fraught racial times . Sure, people are buying her books, shelling out five figures for her appearances, and being confronted with her ideas at workplace seminars. But are they really getting it?\n\nClearly, many are not, even among the self-selected group of progressive knowledge-class workers with a professed interest in DiAngelo's brand of anti-racism. (Lord help those in figurative flyover factories who are force-fed her enthusiasms for racially segregated \"affinity groups,\" among many other questionable ideas.) The selling proposition of Nice Racism is that DiAngelo can, by shaming those in her targeted demo who refuse to take their medicine, guilt enough of their cohort to double down on doing the work. And oh, is there so much work.\n\nA subhed in a section near the end summarizes what's required: \"Lifelong Commitment.\" \"We must not ever consider our work toward racial justice to be finished,\" DiAngelo admonishes. For those white people who deign to believe they have achieved true anti-racism, she offers an exhausting, impossible-to-achieve 21-point checklist, including such items as, \"I use my position as a white 'insider' to share information with BIPOC people,\" and \"I have demonstrated that I am open to feedback on my own unaware racist patterns.\"\n\nConclusion: \"We must continuously educate ourselves through books, films, discussions, conferences, community groups, workbooks, and activism.\" And she knows just the provider to help!\n\nMuch of Nice Racism consists of DiAngelo detecting racist patterns where others might instead observe people trying in their imperfect ways to be human. There is a whole section on white women's tears, with the author criticizing some white mothers in one emotional session for empathetically crying with and consoling black mothers who described talking to their sons about racist cops.\n\nThe relentlessness of the tone-policing after a while makes your face numb: Don't be too quick to show family photos of your BIPOC kids/grandkids, don't be too \"nice,\" don't \"over-smile\" to black people (I am not making that up). Don't think that marrying a black man gives you a pass: \"Sadly, many white women don't demonstrate that their cross-racial relationships have provided a deeper understanding.\"\n\nThere is a paradox at the center of this Miss Racial Manners stuff. DiAngelo's starting point, fundamental to the anti-racist movement, is that just about every instrument and extrusion of society and government was born in racism and perpetuates racially unequal outcomes. You cannot secede from race; you're soaking in it. Therefore, it is incumbent on all good people to consciously disrupt those systems.\n\nBut DiAngelo almost never talks about those systems .\n\nThere is a passing paraphrased assertion late in the book about how some state gun-rights law was somehow connected to racism. Yet any academically rigorous look at the connection between gun rights and racism will preponderantly show the opposite: The system of gun restrictions was originally created as a conscious effort to deprive black Americans of their Second Amendment rights, and the practical application of them to this day leads to tremendous racial disparities . Do the work, people!\n\nThere is almost no policy in Nice Racism . Perhaps that is for the best-at one point DiAngelo writes this whopper of a non-sequitur: \"In discussing white people who define their politics as fiscally conservative but socially liberal, [Heather] McGhee notes that all poverty in the US could be eliminated by spending just 12 percent more than the cost of the 2017 Republican tax cuts.\" That is not how either poverty or government spending works.\n\nApplying the \" systemic racism \" analysis to actual systems requires understanding how said systems work, and having the humility -otherwise a DiAngelo-recommended virtue-to recognize that results are not the same as intent ; that people who agree on ends will have heartfelt intellectual/policy disagreement about means. A fatal flaw coursing through the anti-racism set is a failure to acknowledge that people who are equally motivated by a desire to improve opportunities for historically disfavored populations may have different ideas about how to accomplish that. See the debates over charter schools, for example, or the minimum wage.\n\nTone-policing individual behavior, on the other hand, has a much more tangible call to action: Devote yourself to continuing education, participate in this seminar, and-of course-buy this book.\n\nBut will they read to the end? There are some people, I am sure, who have a taste for political self-flagellation, for being on the masochistic end of collective shaming, for being told that even the desire for forgiveness is untenably racist. But even among that unhappy subset, there surely are limits to consuming page after page of anxiety-wracked pessimism and an almost juvenile defensiveness over being challenged.\n\nToward the end of Nice Racism , DiAngelo quotes a 75-year-old man who has the gall to write an email criticizing her for making negative generalizations about old white people on NPR. The note runs all of 165 words. DiAngelo responds with a six-page rant, complete with enumeration of 10 \"unspoken white racial 'rules,'\" blasting the correspondent's \"hostility and condescension.\" It is a hilariously disproportionate and ungracious projection of the author's by-now-evident personality traits.\n\n\"In addition, given that the writer is a white man chastising a white woman with more knowledge of the matter than he has, it also nicely illustrates the intersection of white and male arrogance: both whitesplaining and mansplaining,\" she snarls.\n\nRobin DiAngelo's main contribution to racial discourse, for better and for worse, is prodding those of us with fair skin to be more cognizant that we benefit from a cultural and legal expectation that our immutable characteristics are the default \"normal.\" Those born different, she rightly points out, are too often denied individual agency and instead categorized negatively into a group identity.\n\nBut her response isn't to confer that overdue individuality onto minority populations. It's to enthusiastically commit the same category error with the largest category. When people recoil at the effort, well, that's just their racism talking.\n\n\"There is deep racial resentment roiling just under the surface of many white people,\" DiAngelo writes.

      "text": "California Women's March Canceled for Being 'Overwhelmingly White'\n\nPolitical Correctness\n\nRobby Soave | 12.31.2018 9:08 AM\n\nOrganizers of a planned Women's March in Eureka, California, cancelled an event due to concerns that too many white people would show up-which is a pretty damning indictment of intersectionality, the ubiquitous yet contradictory philosophy of the modern activist left.\n\nA rally had been scheduled for January 19, but Women's March leaders aborted their plans because \"up to this point, the participants have been overwhelmingly white, lacking representation from several perspectives in our community,\" according to a press release . \"This decision was made after many conversations between local social-change organizers and supporters of the march.\"\n\nThis news attracted much derision , and deservedly so. For one thing, the disproportionate white involvement might simply reflect the fact that Eureka is about 75 percent white , according to U.S. Census data. For another, leftists often claim that white people are responsible for President Donald Trump's victory in 2016-inexplicably, white women are held in particular contempt, even though they vote Democratic more often than white men-and need to change their attitudes. But here's some white folks expressing enthusiasm about joining their comrades of color in the #Resistance, only to be told, Well, maybe you should stay home .\n\nThe Eureka incident lends itself to a kind of Eureka! insight about the problems with intersectionality, which has become the dominant intellectual theory of the left in the three decades since sociologist Kimberle Crenshaw first proposed it. According to intersectionality, various forms of oppression are distinct yet interrelated, and these forms stack: A black man is more oppressed than a white man, a black woman is more oppressed than a black man, a gay black woman is even more oppressed, and so on.\n\nThere's nothing innately wrong with such analysis, but adherents of intersectionality also tend to believe that the oppressed are the sole experts on the subject of their own oppression. At the same time, it is not their job to educate you -a line parroted by many activists, particularly on college campuses, when they are questioned. As a result, intersectionality in practice often means that some activists expect well-intended liberals to sit down, step back, and defer to the expertise of the most marginalized people. But those people might not be well-positioned to lead a mass #Resistance movement-they may have disabilities, poor mental health, or lack of access to financial means, which are all stackable categories of oppression-and they might even expect the cis white hetero males to take a turn doing the work. It's really hard to square all these circles.\n\nThat's one important conclusion of my book, Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump , which I am pleased to announce will be released in 2019. (It's already available for preorder here .) I interviewed tons of activists about their goals, motivations, and beliefs, and one of the most common recurring themes was infighting caused by intersectionality. As one young activist woman told me, she absolutely hated the 2017 Women's March that occurred the day after Trump's inauguration, in which half a million people took to the streets of Washington, D.C., to protest the president. Why? You guessed it: too white.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "'You Do Not As a White Cis Man Tell Me to Calm Down!' Angry Students Overwhelm YAF Meeting\n\nCampus Free Speech\n\nRobby Soave | 10.6.2016 4:01 PM\n\nIt happened again : After clashing with conservative students at the University of Kansas two weeks ago, leftists once again overran a meeting of the campus's Young Americans for Freedom chapter.\n\nThey had been invited to attend the meeting by the head of YAF, although I presume he did not expect dozens of them to show up-and to interrupt so frequently as to make any dialogue impossible.\n\nYAF released an edited two-minute clip of the meeting, which gives us some idea of what happened. A black woman-the same student from the last meeting, apparently the leader of the leftists-accused a conservative of engaging in hate speech shortly after calling him an \"entitled ass.\" Eventually, this woman and another female student began shouting and banging their hands on the table, which prompted one YAF member to ask them to calm down.\n\n\"You do not get to tell me to calm down!\" thundered the second woman. \"You do not as a cis white man tell me to calm the fuck down!\"\n\nThe student is of course welcome to speak as loudly and angrily as she wants-she might even have good reasons to be passionate. As far as I know, YAF invited these students to come, so I would not say that anyone's free speech rights were violated.\n\nThat said, the hypocrisy displayed by the leftists here is remarkable. They believe they have the right to speak as loudly and rudely as they wish-that no one gets to shut them down. At the same time, they favor some version of censorship for conservative students: They assert the right to be made \"safe\" from ideas that offend them, or make them uncomfortable. And they despise YAF for arguing against these kinds of safe spaces.\n\nBut if Kansas's campus were to become a safe space-and if the university were to enforce a policy of obligatory emotional comfort in a remotely even-handed way-it's the liberal students would who feel the brunt of the censorship. You can't organize a mob, bang on tables, and scream in people's faces while simultaneously insisting that everybody's subjective feelings of discomfort should trump free speech. These leftist students have a lot of contempt for the Constitution-they say so in the video-and yet they are completely reliant upon the protection of the First Amendment, which gives them the right to shout hurtful things at people who disagree with them.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Liberals Who Learned About White Privilege Became Less Sympathetic to Poor Whites\n\nSocial Justice\n\nRobby Soave | 5.29.2019 9:15 AM\n\nDoes educating people about white privilege-the idea that for white people, their race is a boon, but for black people, a drawback, at least in certain social situations-make them more empathetic? A fascinating new study suggests that the kind of racism awareness training taught in many university classrooms is not only useless but may actually be detrimental.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General in April. Researchers provided participants with some academic literature explaining the concept of white privilege and then asked them to gauge their reactions to hearing a story about an unfortunate man. For some participants, the man was described as black, for others, he was described as white. Researchers also ran a separate experiment in which the participants were not told about white privilege before reacting to the story. They also queried both sets of participants about their political beliefs.\n\nWhat they found was that conservatives who had learned about white privilege were no more sympathetic to the poor black man than conservatives who had not learned about white privilege. For liberals, the results were alarming: Liberals who read the educational materials about white privilege were similarly unsympathetic to the poor black man as the liberals in the second experiment, but they were even more unsympathetic to the poor white man.\n\n\"What we found startling was that white privilege lessons didn't increase liberals' sympathy for poor Black people,\" writes Erin Cooley, one of the study's authors and an assistant professor of psychology at Colgate University, in an explanatory post for Vice . \"Instead, these lessons decreased liberals' sympathy for poor white people, which led them to blame white people more for their own poverty. They seemed to think that if a person is poor despite all the privileges of being white, there must really be something wrong with them.\"\n\nIn other words, learning about white privilege did not make conservatives more empathetic, and it made some liberals less empathetic, overall.\n\nReflecting on this finding for Quillette , Zaid Jilani proposes a possible explanation:\n\nWhat accounts for this? One possibility is that social liberals are internalizing white-privilege lessons in a way that flattens the image of whites, portraying all of them as inherently privileged. So if a white person is poor, it must be his or her own fault. After all, they've had all sorts of advantages in life that others haven't.\n\nThis would mean that the sort of social justice training programs offered by numerous universities could be having an undesirable effect, give that most students who enroll in these classes are liberals. To take just one example, the University of Colorado at Denver offers a class called \"Problematizing Whiteness: Educating for Racial Justice,\" in which students are required to look \"beyond feel-good momentary White racial awareness\" and realize that \"whites are complicit.\" In researching my book, Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump , I found numerous similar examples of academic exercises that blurred the line between anti-racism and anti-whiteness, and between scholarship and activism. It would hardly be surprising if these classes, rather than changing liberal students' feelings toward disadvantaged black people, merely galvanized them against whites.\n\nReached for comment, Cooley told me that she thought such a course \"could amplify the effects as you suggest,\" but \"if the course tackled many different forms of hierarchy (class, ability, gender, sexual orientation), I would hope that students would leave with a more nuanced view of inequality and, thus, perhaps not show the effects we see in our study.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Sharon McBride, a black member of city council and who supports Buttigieg's bid, was there to push back against the notion that black people disapprove of the mayor.\n\nHer remarks were interrupted by protesters affiliated with Black Lives Matter. One of the protesters, who appeared to be a white man, marched to the front of the room, seized the microphone from McBride, and started haranguing the audience.\n\n\"Who chose these people as black leaders?\" the activist asked. \"Who organized this? Why are we talking about Pete Buttigieg? What kind of nonsense is this?\"\n\nHe then led protesters in a chant of \"this is a farce.\"\n\nOne event attendee who did not appreciate the activist's antics raised her cane as if to strike him but was restrained by others. A local reporter captured the interaction on video:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MaxLewisTV/status/1202364112237453313\n\nSeveral of the Black Lives Matter activists were black. But since the main player was white, the irony was not lost on Twitter observers:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1202380875561885697\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed :\n\nMany of the roughly 60 people who attended-many of them black-cheered or nodded along at positive mentions of Buttigieg. They also rolled their eyes or voiced their displeasure with each interruption from the dozen Black Lives Matter protesters who lined the back wall.\n\nAfterward, McBride told BuzzFeed News the confrontation was \"disheartening\" and \"disrespectful.\" She said she hadn't realized the man was wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt.\n\n\"You respect people's opinions, and we respect theirs,\" she said.\n\nThe episode highlights the hypocrisy of many intersectional activists (a major theme of my book Panic Attack ). They often claim that the marginalized are the sole experts on their own oppression and thus are the only people allowed to speak on issues related to it; white people, they say, should step back and let black people talk about racism. But in practice, few activists can keep quiet while someone else is touting a candidate the activist perceives to be insufficiently radical.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Global Warming: White Man's Problem\n\nPolicy\n\nShikha Dalmia | 7.17.2009 4:30 PM\n\nIf I were an environmental activist, I would be despairing right around now about ever getting meaningful action on global warming. Over the last eight years, eco-warriors had managed to convince themselves that the main obstacle to their grand designs to recalibrate the Earth's thermostat was a stupid and callow U.S. president unwilling to lead the rest of the world.\n\nBut with Barack Obama in office they no longer have that problem. In fact, they have a charismatic and savvy spokesman who combines a deep commitment to their cause with considerable powers of persuasion. Yet his call to action at last week's G-8 summit in Italy yielded little more than polite applause, and that only when he issued a mea culpa. \"I know that in the past, the United States has sometimes fallen short of meeting our responsibilities,\" he said amid cheers. \"So let me be clear: Those days are over.\"\n\nWhat did this brave self-flagellation yield? To be sure, he got the attendees to collectively declare that they would never ever let the Earth's temperature rise two degrees centigrade from pre-industrial levels. This is supposedly a prelude to the real horse-trading over emissions cuts that will begin in a Copenhagen, Denmark, meeting this December.\n\nBut the depressing thing for climate warriors was that Obama could not get developing countries, without whose cooperation there is simply no way to avert climate change, to accept-even just in theory-the idea of binding emissions cuts. India's prime minister took the occasion to position his country as a major victim of a problem not of its making. \"What we are witnessing today is the consequence [of] over two centuries of industrial activity and high-consumption lifestyles in the developed world,\" he lectured . \"They have to bear this historical responsibility.\" And even before the summit began, China declared the West had \"no right\" to ask it to limit its economic growth.\n\nRather than engage with the issues, eco-pundits are grasping for all kinds of fanciful pseudo-scientific theories to explain why Obama's sweet-talking ways are leaving the rest of the world cold. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, for instance, recently blamed the lack of progress on the faulty circuitry evolution has wired into the human brain. According to Kristof, evolution has programmed us to be alert to immediate threats, such as snakes, or enemies with clubs, but not for vastly greater but less imminent dangers that require forethought. If this sounds like a warmed-over, 21st-century version of the Calvinistic crooked-timber view of human nature, that's because it is.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kristof's Nobel Prize-winning colleague at the Times , Paul Krugman, pulled out the folk story about the frog and the boiling pot in his latest column to explain our collective torpor over climate change. Just as the proverbial frog wasn't able to feel the gradually rising temperature before he boiled to death, so too, in Krugman's telling, human beings are not equipped to comprehend the dangers of an overheating planet before they fry to death.\n\nBut this psychologizing only exposes the inability of climate activists to take seriously the rational case for inaction. In fact, there is a perfectly good reason developing countries are unwilling to act on climate change: What they are being asked to do is more awful than climate change's implications--even if one accepts all the alarmist predictions.\n\nConsider what would be necessary to slash global greenhouse-gas emissions just 50% below 2000 levels by 2050-a far less aggressive goal than what the enviros say is necessary to avert climate catastrophe. According to U.S. Chamber of Commerce calculations , even if the West reduced its emissions by 80% below 2000 levels, developing countries would still have to return their emissions to 2000 levels to meet the 50% target. However, Indians currently consume roughly 15 times less energy per capita than Americans-and Chinese consume seven times less. Asking them, along with the rest of the developing world, to go back to 2000 emission levels with a 2050 population would mean putting them on a very drastic energy diet.\n\nThe human toll of this is unfathomable: It would require these countries to abandon plans to ever conquer poverty, of course. But beyond that it would require a major scaling back of living standards under which their middle classes-for whom three square meals, cars and air-conditioning are only now beginning to come within reach-would have to go back to subsistence living, and the hundreds of millions who are at subsistence would have to accept starvation.\n\nIn short, the choice for developing countries is between mass death due to the consequences of an overheated planet sometime in the distant future, and mass suicide due to imposed instant starvation right now. Is it any surprise that they are reluctant to jump on the global-warming bandwagon?\n\nThe Waxman-Markey climate change bill that just passed the U.S. House of Representatives wants to force developing countries to accept this fate by resorting to the old and tired method of protectionism. Should this monstrosity become law, starting in 2020 the United States will impose carbon tariffs on goods from any country that does not accept binding reductions. But this is a path to mutually assured economic destruction-not to combating climate change.\n\nFor starters, by 2020, when these tariffs go into effect, India and China-with GDPs projected to grow anywhere from 6% to 10% annually-will have much bigger economies with huge domestic markets that they are increasingly opening to each other. Thus they might well be better off forgoing access to the U.S. market than accepting crippling restrictions on their growth.\n\nAlso, by then they will have more economic clout on the world stage to enforce their own ideas of who ought to take moral responsibility for climate change. The West's case for restricting Indian and Chinese exports rests on the claim that these countries' total emissions will exceed those from the West within the next few decades. (China's emissions are already at par with those of the U.S., the biggest emitter).\n\nBut these countries have, and will continue to have, far lower emissions on a per-capita basis, given that China's are now around one-fifth those of the United States and India's one-twentieth. Thus they would have an equally valid case for imposing countervailing restrictions on American exports based on per-capita emissions. The West might well be the bigger loser in this economic warfare if it is barred from accessing new, growing markets.\n\nObama obviously understands this-which is why he has condemned the House's turn down the protectionist path. So what should climate warriors do? Right now the only certain way to save lives is by calling off this misguided war on climate change. If and when climate change promises to claim more casualties than poverty and starvation, the world will begin heeding their calls. If, however, these climate-change casualties don't materialize, there would have been no need to act in the first place. Either way, the world has far more immediate and scarier problems than climate change to address right now.\n\nShikha Dalmia is a senior analyst at Reason Foundation and a columnist for Forbes .

      "text": "Deep Questions Raised, No Answers Provided\n\nA review of Mohsin Hamid's 'The Last White Man.'\n\nIt signals a certain ambition when an author begins a novel by alluding to one of the most famous opening sentences in all of literature, the first line of Kafka's Metamorphosis : \"When Gregor Samsa woke one morning from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed right there in his bed into some sort of monstrous insect.\" Mohsin Hamid is thus setting himself a high bar when he opens his most recent novel, The Last White Man , with a clear echo of Samsa's fate: \"One morning Anders, a white man, woke up to find he had turned a deep and undeniable brown.\"\n\nAnders is not the only person undergoing such a transformation. Rumors begin to emerge of other people suddenly turning dark-skinned as well. Soon there is no doubt: ever more people are waking up with a different skin color. Eventually there are almost no white people remaining, until finally, when Anders's own father dies, we learn that he was the \"last white man\" of the book's title. Whiteness has become a thing of the past.\n\nA novel could hardly have been better timed than this one. Ironically, Hamid began thinking about the book some time ago, as he reflected on his own racial identity in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. But after two years of pandemic and racial debate, The Last White Man serendipitously taps into the hottest topics of our current collective psyche. As racial transformations multiply, Hamid writes, some people tried to escape, \"to find places unaffected, convinced the calamity was infectious.\" But most could not simply leave, \"so the general buzz was about progress towards discovering a way to undo the horror, but for every story of a miracle drug or concoction that made you white again, there were three or four of someone who had grown terribly sick from imbibing it, or had even died.\" Hard not to hear echoes in that of debates over various quack treatments for coronavirus.\n\nRace, however, is at the heart of the novel, which raises a number of important questions. To what extent do others see us in terms of our race? When Anders's girlfriend Oona comes to visit him after his transformation, \"it was as if she was seeing him for the first time, an unknown person, and she had to will herself to see Anders in him.\" By the same token, to what extent do we understand ourselves in terms of our race? As Anders says to Oona in a later conversation, \"he was not sure he was the same person, he had begun by feeling that under the surface it was still him, who else could it be, but it was not that simple, and the way people act around you, it changes what you are, who you are.\" After his transformation, Anders unsurprisingly becomes aware of racial difference in new ways; for example, he for the first time begins to pay attention to the black custodian at the gym where he works, wondering why he has taken little notice of him in the past, and whether he himself is now invisible in similar ways.\n\nThe pandemic of racial transformation also has social consequences. Oona's mother watches the news and follows right-wing online sources, certain that this is a conspiracy by \"them\" to destroy \"us.\" Volunteer militias form in order to track down those whose race has changed and to drive them away, or worse. Anders himself, having been warned to leave, goes into hiding at his father's home. Isolated violent incidents give way to rioting, which peters out only as its futility gradually becomes clear, because \"life in town was going back to normal, or if not going back to normal, at least stopping becoming increasingly abnormal, with more people changing, so many it was almost to be expected when the next one did, it was commonplace.\"\n\nDespite the timeliness of these issues, however, The Last White Man does not quite live up to its promise. Repeatedly, Hamid prompts us to reflect upon challenging questions of identity: Is Anders still the same person after his transformation? Even if few people, including former acquaintances, recognize him any longer? Is Oona still in love with the same man? When characters feel regret over their lost whiteness, should we sympathize with them or think them narrow-minded? Do the transformations signal an overturning of the established racial order, a cosmopolitan humanism that values a core humanity beyond race, or the abolition of race altogether?\n\nHamid skirts lightly over all such questions. He lets them surface briefly before sweeping the reader along in a rush of paragraph-long, run-on sentences that make up much of the breathless text. These allow the reader to share in the characters' disorientation, but not to pause for thought. Not even Anders and Oona (who also changes color later in the novel) reflect very deeply upon their situation. The book ends with a six-page chapter spanning fifteen years, from the end of the pandemic, through the marriage of Anders and Oona, to the birth of their daughter, who is a teenager on the novel's last page, when Anders \"placed his brown hand on the side of her brown face, soothing her, his brown daughter, his daughter.\" One may welcome this comforting conclusion and the prospect of racial tension's disappearance. But one cannot help feeling that it has all been a bit too easy.\n\nWhat Hamid captures best are the intergenerational relationships between Anders and his father and Oona and her mother. The latter struggles against Oona's relationship with this now-brown man, finally accepting it only after her own transformation and, more importantly, when confronted by her new granddaughter. More richly drawn is Anders's tense relationship with his distant but loyal father, who with some difficulty accepts his son's transformation and feels a duty to protect him, even as he himself is slowly dying and in visibly increasing pain. The gradual rapprochement between the two after years of partial estrangement is the novel's most moving aspect.\n\nIn the end, The Last White Man is a good book that should have been better. An enjoyable read, it raises questions like a reasonably bright undergraduate who is just clever enough to see what the problems are but not finally to say much about them. It is more a reflection of our debates over race than an important contribution to them.\n\nPeter C.

      "text": "Getting Past 'First'\n\nIn 2024, how much does it matter that our president could be someone who's not a white man?\n\nMy favorite thing about Kamala Harris-and the list is not very long-is that she never held that silliest and most un-republican of all titles in American public life: first lady.\n\nHarris seems likely, at the moment, to become our first female president. We might have done worse-and almost did.\n\nAt the Democrats' convention this week, Hillary Clinton made the inevitable glass-ceiling speech , and the moment must have been for her at best bittersweet, leaning into the bitter. But Mrs. Bill Clinton always exemplified one of the worst ways to be a woman in politics: She was an appendage of a powerful, politically successful intern-diddler who treated her poorly and used her as a prop.\n\nMrs. Clinton does not lack for raw brainpower, but she was never a patch on the politician her husband was, lacking his charm, his remarkable gift for extemporaneous speaking, and his skill as a practical politician. I have no doubt that she is utterly his match when it comes to totally cold and self-seeking amorality, but whereas President Clinton could fool people into thinking that he genuinely gave a rat's ass about them and their petty little problems with seemingly no effort at all, Mrs. Clinton was always more of a grinder, and you could see her doing the hard work of pretending to be a morally and psychologically normal human being. For 30-odd years (some of them very odd), Mrs. Clinton has been one of the most painful people to watch on the lavishly appointed stage of our ghastly politics. She will likely go down in history as the only person ever to lose a general election to Donald Trump, that champion of evangelical Christians, serial bankrupt, game-show host, and quondam pornographer.\n\nHarris, as she will tell you-and tell you, and tell you-checks some other boxes. She wouldn't be the first black president (she would be the second black president with no ancestral connection to the larger African American community composed of the descendants of slaves, which will be of interest to somebody somewhere, I am sure) but she would be the first president of Indian background and of Caribbean background. So she'd be putting points on the board for two increasingly important minority constituencies simultaneously. (Colin Powell, our first black secretary of state and the man who might have been our first black president, if he had desired to be, also was of Jamaican ancestry, a child of immigrants raised in the South Bronx.) This state of affairs seems to have confused Trump, possibly because he is a rage-addled ignoramus, but if you're looking for a political class that-pardon the odious expression-\"looks like America,\" Kamala Harris and Tim Walz together cover a lot of ground.\n\nBut I wonder: Are her indelible characteristics still all that interesting? Kamala Harris does not seem to me a very interesting sort of person in general, but, if I were making a list of interesting things about her, her sex and her ethnic background-and the fact that she was the first person with such characteristics to hold certain offices-still wouldn't be very high on the list. (Top of the list? Her pissy authoritarianism .)\n\nIn the coming years, we'll have a lot of first Mexican American woman to hold this position and first gay man of color to hold that position, and, unless I grievously misread the national radar-a distinct possibility given the work I put into insulating myself from the tsunami of raw sewage that is American popular culture-it is all starting to feel a little bit silly to a lot of people. For example, it probably mattered, or at least was of interest, when one of those big corporations founded in the late 19th century or in the early 20th century had its first chairman or CEO who wasn't a white man. But was it really a big deal at a company like Microsoft? Or at firm of more recent vintage? If your IPO was announced on Twitter, your company is really part of the world in which it was accepted as utterly ordinary that the commanding heights of business and politics would not be entirely dominated by white men. (Don't get me wrong: We're still doing pretty good!) There are culturally and economically important businesses and institutions out there that have never had a white man in charge. So, it was a very big deal when we had our first black president, a job so presumptively white and male that we built a gigantic white phallus in the capital city to honor the first guy to hold the job, but less so when it was (or will be) the first black woman to serve as deputy undersecretary of commerce for this, that, or the other.\n\nHarris never held the ridiculous title \"first lady,\" which my iPhone wants to capitalize, damn its digital eyes, though she was adjacent to the ridiculous title \"second gentleman,\" which is what people have been calling her husband while she is vice president. I know I have beat this drum until the skin is loose, but: This is a republic, and we do not have aristocratic titles or quasi-aristocratic titles, nor do we have political positions that are acquired by means of marriage-at least, that's how it is supposed to be. For all of the silly Republican efforts to characterize Harris' political career as founded on her long-ago relationship with San Francisco political boss Willie Brown, she is, for better and for worse, her own woman, not an Eva Perón carried to power by her husband or an Indira Gandhi whose father was the first leader of her country in independence. Female leaders have been a mixed bag, of course: Margaret Thatcher was terrific, Golda Meir heroic, Gandhi a tyrant-and many of the ones who were carried to power by marriage turned out to be what their husbands were, i.e., corrupt petty criminals. Women do represent about half of the world's population if not half of its political leaders, so we would expect them to cover the range in full.\n\nI don't like the idea that having a president from a particular demographic group puts a kind of national imprimatur on that group, and I object for two reasons: 1) I am an old-fashioned romantic individualist who believes that what's important about people is who they are rather than who they are as a member of some group into which they were born; 2) it further entrenches the position of the presidency as a kind of magical cultural totem, the national idol figure in which the demos worships itself . That being said, I won't rain on all the parades that will commence if Kamala Harris should become, as a matter of politics and the executive branch, at least, the actual first lady in the only meaningful sense of those two words.\n\nKevin D.

      "text": "Open the Books on Critical Race Theory\n\nThere should be nothing controversial about transparency rules that allow parents to see what their kids are being taught in school.\n\nIt's no surprise that parents are outraged at public schools teaching \"critical race theory\" (CRT)-or whatever term one prefers for the fashionable notions that America is systemically racist and that the solution is to treat people differently based on skin color. Taxpayers, after all, typically expect the schools they pay for to teach kids history, science, literature, and math-not to indoctrinate them into false and destructive political dogmas.\n\nMany school bureaucrats deny that these notions are being taught in classrooms, but they are. Former teacher Kali Fontanilla-to cite just one example- recently revealed how schools in her home state of California are \"hyper race-focused,\" with social science classes centered around teaching that \"America was built to only help the white man.\" Curricula rooted in CRT dispense with historical fact s, and aim instead at instructing black students that capitalism, private property rights, the constitutional rule of law, and other elements of American democracy are inherently biased against them, so that nothing short of a radical overhaul of government and culture can enable them to succeed. White students, on the other hand, are taught that whatever success their families have attained is merely a consequence of undeserved \"privilege,\" for which they must atone. (As for Asian students, they're effectively ignored .)\n\nDetroit Schools Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said at a board of education meeting last fall, \"our curriculum is deeply using critical race theory,\" not just in history and social science, but in \"the other disciplines,\" and that the effort was \"intentional.\" That only makes sense: It's hard to see how an English teacher's lesson plan would be unaffected by the notion that \"worship of the written word\" is \"characteristic of white supremacy,\" or how a science instructor could teach physics if she believes \" either/or thinking \" and \" objectivity \" are racist.\n\nThe sad truth is that these ideas are themselves both racist and debilitating. They're racist because they presume-indeed, overtly declare-either that all white people believe or act in certain ways, or that virtues such as objectivity and professionalism are by definition white characteristics. And they're debilitating because they lead students to conclude that the cultural and social patterns arising from such concepts as individual rights or the rule of law are inevitably oppressive. Simply put, the most important part of the CRT formula is the word systemic . When America is alleged to be systemically racist, the system in question is capitalist liberalism, if not Western civilization itself. Overturning that \"system\" is CRT's imperative.\n\nThe consequence of teaching this in schools is to inculcate in pupils either a sense of helpless despair or bitter and dangerous resentment against a target described vaguely enough that political leaders can train it against whatever they want. In 1946, psychologist Viktor Frankl warned against what he called \"learned meaninglessness,\" resulting from the \"nihilism transmitted on many an academic campus,\" which can either sap a student's will to achieve or boil over into violent rage that demagogues can harness to their will. But Frederick Douglass beat Frankl to it by half a century, when he denounced black politicians who argued that America was so hopelessly racist that black Americans should emigrate to Africa. Such \"nonsense,\" he warned,\n\ntends to throw over the negro a mantle of despair. It leads him to doubt the possibility of his progress as an American citizen.... Its tendency is to make him despondent and doubtful, where he should be made to feel assured and confident. It forces upon him the idea that he is forever doomed to be a stranger and a sojourner in the land of his birth.... With such ideas constantly flaunted before him, he cannot easily set himself to work to better his condition in such ways as are open to him here.\n\nCRT's grip on public schools has not only sparked understandable fury, but has also inspired efforts by state lawmakers to rein in such propagandizing. There's no doubt that legislators can do this-courts have ruled that \"the First Amendment does not protect primary and secondary school teachers' in-class curricular speech\"-but there is a legitimate debate over how this is best done. David French and others have warned that if such anti-CRT bills are written in vague terms, they risk stifling legitimate educational goals, and that's true. Oklahoma's recently adopted HB 1775 prohibits teachers from \"mak[ing] part of a course\" the \"concept\" that \"one race or sex is inherently superior to another,\" which could arguably forbid everything from Shakespeare to the novels of Zora Neale Hurston. On the other hand, a proposal such as Alaska's HB 343 , which prohibits officials from \"compelling a school employee to affirm ... that an individual, by virtue of their sex, race, ethnicity...[etc.] is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive,\" is not only narrow enough to pass constitutional muster, but would impose a common-sense limit on how public servants use their power and our money.\n\nBut whatever one thinks of that debate, there is an alternative: transparency. Public schools are creatures of the state, and parents have a right to know what is being taught to their children. Allowing them to examine the teaching materials used in classrooms-CRT-related or otherwise-helps parents to know how their public schools are operating, and empowers them to make better choices, not only about whether to speak up at school board meetings, but about other things: whether to hire a tutor, for example, or whether to have a family discussion about a sensitive subject being addressed in a class. Transparency encourages the kind of involved parenting teachers often claim to want.\n\nEfforts are now underway in 24 states to require public schools to make publicly available a list of the books, videos, or other materials that teachers present to students. These requirements are minimally invasive-a simple list of the materials (disclosing the title, author, and/or internet link for each) posted on a website would typically suffice, and teachers could still introduce new items at the last minute, as long as they promptly update the disclosure list. Yet CRT proponents have attacked the very concept of transparency, claiming that it will stifle classroom discussions. The ACLU, for example-which used to be a prominent defender of government transparency, and still has a section on its website devoted to the subject-issued a statement condemning these proposals for \"chilling\" free speech in the classroom. The leftist PEN America has called them downright \"censorious.\"\n\nThese accusations are obviously absurd: For one thing, transparency doesn't mean schools can't teach sensitive topics. When a group in Tennessee objected to a lesson plan that taught Ruby Bridges Goes to School: My True Story and Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the state's education board rejected the complaint, and rightly so. But more importantly, teachers employed by the government have no constitutional right to tell students whatever they wish; they're required to obey curriculum rules set by local and state laws. Parents, by contrast, do have a fundamental constitutional right to oversee their children's upbringing. Only someone who thinks schools exist to rescue kids from their own parents could object-as the 1619 Project's Nikole Hannah-Jones recently did -to \"the idea that parents should decide what's being taught.\"\n\nCRT proponents do, in fact, think that. CRT is an activist mindset, not a scholarly theory-as education expert Jonathan Butcher recently observed , it's \"meant to be applied ... it's not just an idea; it's effectively a verb.\" Its principal aim is to take white kids from their inevitably racist households and transform them into new, more \"woke\" citizens, while conscripting black students into cultural and political activism-and even violence . A century ago, the progressive President Woodrow Wilson said that the ideal school would \"make a son as unlike his father as possible,\" and while today's progressives would eschew Wilson's gendered language, they still embrace his sentiment. Most parents, however, would prefer schools to equip students with the knowledge necessary to pursue their own happiness, rather than propagating historical falsehoods to recruit kids into a radical political movement. That's why CRT advocates such as Hannah-Jones view transparency requirements as a threat. Actual scholars propounding genuine scholarly theories typically welcome publicity and discussion. But publicity is the last thing CRT's partisans want.\n\nOf course, there are some parents who would prefer that their children's education emphasize CRT or multiculturalist ideas-and transparency requirements would help these parents, too, since it would enable them to decide whether their public schools are devoting sufficient time to these doctrines; if not, they could choose schools such as the New Concept Development Center , the Sovereign Community School , or the Social Justice School . But that's not enough to satisfy CRT activists, who view themselves on a mission to fundamentally alter the American nation. The easiest way to do that is to change public school curricula into taxpayer-funded propaganda, with as little oversight from parents as possible.\n\nWhen it's convenient to do so, the left claims that democracy dies in darkness. But when it comes to CRT, they prefer to keep such matters from parents. That's doubtless because they know their doctrines are extraordinarily unpopular, even among non-whites , and that if given the choice, parents would rather their kids be taught that whatever cruelties their ancestors suffered, and whatever obstacles they themselves may face, they can rise through objectivity, professionalism, determination, and other virtues. That, after all, is the truth.\n\nTimothy Sandefur is vice president for litigation at the Goldwater Institute, which has authored the academic transparency legislation discussed in this article.\n\nTimothy Sandefur is vice president for legal affairs at the Goldwater Institute.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

Legal Statement .\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2025 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nRay Dalio , a billionaire market speculator and founder of the oddest investment company that I have ever come across, Bridgewater Associates, has been making the rounds on cable news and even \"60 Minutes\" feeding the liberal media what it loves most:  A big, piping hot helping of bull---t about the various evils of capitalism and his solution to fix things by, of course, raising taxes on the rich.\n\nNot that this matters to most business journalists who are covering and loving Dalio's weird roadshow because they aren't very capitalist themselves. Telling most business reporters that \"the American Dream is lost,\" or \"capitalism needs to be reformed\" and we must make the \"rich\" pay their fair share is like offering President Trump three scoops of ice cream for dessert instead of two; you will never hear a word of protest.\n\nThis is a shame because Dalio is a particularly odd guy to be calling balls and strikes on capitalism. Yes, Wall Street guys like Dalio know a lot about markets, but they are particularly tone deaf on economics. They know how to make a quick buck on a trade but they know a lot less on how to make something work for the long haul.\n\nDalio fits this profile neatly. He's a billionaire many times over, not from inventing anything special, but as a market speculator. Now some of my best friends and sources are really good at market speculating, but that doesn't mean they're incredibly deep thinkers, and those who say they are, like Dalio, should be judged with a degree of skepticism.\n\nFirst, see Dalio's book, \"Principles: Life and Work\", a weird personal manifesto of what he believes are ways to be successful in business and life.  Some of his principles are cringe-worthy obvious (PAIN + REFLECTION = PROGRESS), others just cringe worthy pedantic as in the one that advises: \"Great planners who don't execute their plans go nowhere.\"\n\nFull disclosure: I haven't read \"Principles\" but I bet I can probably get more practical self-help advice from a Tony Robbins video.\n\nThen listen to the problems he says he's worried about and how he plans to fix them.\n\nEducation, or the lack of it in poor communities, is high on his list. He wants to raise taxes to make sure kids in poor school districts get a better education. Sounds good until you dig a bit deeper and realize that the money he's raising goes right into the pockets of the teachers unions and education establishment, which has spent the past two decades opposing school choice and other reforms that have been proven to benefit poor kids.\n\nDalio has been talking a lot about the gap between the rich and poor, which he says remains disturbingly high and will sow the seeds of violent conflict. Ok, but lots of anecdotal evidence is pointing to the fact that a combination of the Trump tax cuts and a decline in immigration has increased wages on the low end of the scale.\n\nMeanwhile, a lot of other quantitative evidence shows the wealth gap grew alarmingly wide during the Obama years, and well after the ravages of the Great Recession when the Fed printed money making stock speculators like Dalio rich, and expanded social programs that did little for the working class.\n\nFinally do a little research on the hedge fund he runs, Bridgewater Associates.\n\nYes it's big ($160 billion in assets) and successful most of the time, but it's also run like a police-state version of a hedge fund. All meetings are taped and recorded. Secrecy is paramount and the firm is notorious for its strictly enforced non-disclosure agreements. All of which makes sense because we're dealing with a lot of money here, but also because the place is so damn weird to work at, as I am told by my Wall Street sources who have a first-hand knowledge of the weirdness.\n\nIn an almost cult like fashion, employees must read and nearly memorize a short version of Dalio's mind-numbing \"Principles\" book. But that's just the beginning. Dalio preaches something called \"radical transparency,\" where employees gather around and grade investment ideas in one of the investment world's most hostile work environments, something along the lines of that famous Mexican standoff scene in \"Reservoir Dogs\" only without guns. People who stumble over one of Dalio's \"Principles\" are subjected to what is known as a \"public hanging\" of ridicule.\n\nNo wonder the turnover rate at Bridgewater is around 25 percent over approximately a year.\n\nThat wouldn't be so bad if Dalio and his crew were doing something special in the world. They're not. They're charging big bucks for investing money. In fact, they're not doing anything special as far as investing goes. Since its inception, Bridgewater's flagship \"Pure Alpha Strategy\" fund has had an annualized total return of around 12 percent, making it just a little better than the S&P 500 index I can buy from Vanguard.\n\nOK, Dalio must be doing something right or he wouldn't be worth nearly $17 billion, right? Yes, it's true that Dalio built his firm from scratch, and is smart at convincing people to give him their money, but that doesn't mean his critiques of capitalism and his solutions are all that smart. Dalio is credited with predicting the 2008 financial crisis (he was far from alone on this one). But he also recently gave Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont $100 million to improve public education and fund a bunch of other great stuff like making poor communities a better place to live.\n\nDalio is supposed to be good at numbers, which is why it's odd that he thinks his $100 million filtered through one of the most wasteful state governments in the country will do much of anything.\n\nIt's also odd that Dalio thinks higher taxes are the solution to capitalism's ills. Dalio told \"60 Minutes\" that people like him (i.e. the rich) should pay more to make the economy more equitable as long as the money is going to something \"productive\" like education. \"Am I saying something that's controversial?,\" he asked correspondent Bill Whitaker, who replied: \"It's just strange to hear it come from the mouth of a billionaire.\"\n\nIt's also absurd. Government is one of the least productive organizations on the face of the earth. We have a pension crisis, we had a housing crisis, and we have a student-loan debt crisis, not to mention a looming Social Security crisis, lots of debt and a fiscal deficit, because government is big and wasteful and inefficient and until recently, funded by higher taxes.\n\nAnd who exactly are the people like Dalio who will be paying even more taxes? Does he mean we need to raise taxes on dudes who have $17 billion in the bank? Or people with just a few million?\n\nTry funding the utopia Dalio envisions by taxing billionaires and most will leave the country. Even if they stayed there wouldn't be enough money to pay for all the education and poverty eradication in Dalio's utopia. That's why people who earn around $250,000 a year, not $250 million, get hammered so hard by the tax man: There's more of them.\n\nMy guess is that Dalio's little capitalism bashing media tour is a manifestation of rich, white man's guilt, and a need for a big liberal media hug as he approaches 70 years on this earth. Now that he got his hug, maybe he can just go away.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was actually a pretty worthwhile candidate. Policy-wise, she was not my cup of tea, but heck, she sure seems more with it than Biden ( low bar, I know ) and a lot more on point than Comrade Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nIn this Jan. 10, 2020 photo then-Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, - a war veteran whom the Democrat establishment ( thank you Hillary Clinton ) tried to take down by claiming she was a Russian agent. Heard that one before.\n\nTRISH REGAN: SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS MAY GET THE NOMINATION - AND, DEMS HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO BLAME\n\nAnyway, my point is that despite all their talk on equality and how awful President Trump is for women and for minorities, despite all that rhetoric they've been trying to jam down the country's throat, they go with an old, white man.\n\nThey've narrowed it down to two old, white men. I've got nothing against old, white men, but in this case, one is a diehard socialist who thinks Cuba's murderous dictatorship is just great. And the other one, Biden, seems to be kind of losing it? He recently said at a campaign event that he's running for the Senate and he called Fox News' Chris Wallace \"Chuck.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

They managed to lock down the prototype of all they seem to be against - two white men from another generation. Quite a combo - a socialist that honeymooned in Russia and a career establishment-type with a whole lot of corruption baggage.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nAncestry.com on Friday apologized for an ad that showed a mixed-race couple discussing escaping to the North during the Civil War era.\n\nThe ad drew widespread criticism on social media for whitewashing slavery, prompting the DNA testing company to remove it from TV and its YouTube channel. Ancestry started running the ad on TV on April 15, according to research firm iSpot.TV.\n\nThe ad is part of a campaign by Ancestry showing stories from the past to pique viewers' curiosity about their ancestors. It depicts a white man holding up a ring and telling a black woman wearing Civil War-era clothing that they can be together if they escape to the North. The woman says nothing as the scene fades to black, with the line: \"Without you, the story stops here.\"\n\nCritics pointed out that the ad ignores the fact that mixed race couplings during the slavery era were usually not romantic love stories but instead due to rape and violence against slaves.\n\nMany took to Twitter to express complaints about the ad.\n\n\"I used this service a few years ago. And when I realized I was more than 10% European, I wept,\" tweeted Brittany Packnett. \"Not from shame for who I am, but from anger from the trauma of how it may have come to be. This commercial spits on the trauma in our veins and the fight of our ancestors.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Ancestry said the ad was intended to be part of its effort to tell \"important stories from history.\"\n\n\"We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused,\" the company said in the statement.\n\nM.J. McCallum, creative director of Muse Communications, called the ad \"thoughtless,\" but said it could happen to any company that doesn't prioritize having diverse representation in its ranks.\n\n\"I believe it's the responsibility of brands and their agencies to foster inclusive environments,\" he said. \"They must encourage their team members to be open, honest and vulnerable to topics like race and culture.\"\n\nThe Ancestry ad joins a long list of missteps by marketers that are at best tone-deaf and at worst racist.\n\nIn 2017, Dove stopped using a Facebook GIF that showed a black woman removing a brown shirt and transforming into a white woman. The ad was meant to show different types of people can use Dove but many saw it as saying the black woman was \"dirty\" and the white woman was \"clean.\" Dove apologized .\n\nIn 2018, a Heineken ad with the tagline \"Sometimes, Lighter Is Better,\" showed a bartender sliding a bottle of Heineken down a bar where several people of color were sitting before it stops in front of a light-skinned woman. Heineken apologized and pulled the ad after an online outcry in which many people, including Chance the Rapper , called the ad racist.\n\nAnd in February , Gucci pulled a sweater off the market after complaints that the oversized collar designed to cover the face resembled blackface makeup. Italian designer Prada, Katy Perry's fashion line and H&M have also pulled similar racially insensitivity items.\n\n\"The idea that an ad won't be offensive simply because no one who approved it was offended is just not acceptable anymore,\" McCallum said. \"Yes, there is always a chance that even the best of intentions will be misinterpreted, but there are reliable resources and skilled professionals available for brands to tap into.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nSimpler Trading VP of Options Danielle Shay provides insight on investing in the stock market on 'Making Money.'\n\nA 15-year veteran at Google filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against his former tech giant employer alleging the White man was fired for not being \"inclusive\" after rejecting sexual advances from an Asian female executive who repeatedly drunkenly lashed out at him at work events in New York City.\n\nRyan Olohan, the former Managing Director of Food, Beverage and Restaurants at Google, was fired on Aug. 5, 2022. Two members of Google's Employee Investigations team held a video conference with the married father of seven children, informing him he was not \"inclusive\" and was being terminated because he had \"shown favoritism to high performers,\" which the company \"considered 'non-inclusive' and commented on employees' walking pace and hustle, which it called 'ableist,'\" according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in November.\n\nBefore then, Olohan, whose wife is Asian, was allegedly repeatedly sexually harassed by a fellow executive, Tiffany Miller, who held the title of Director of Programmatic Media. Miller is also Asian.\n\n\"Mr. Olohan's complaint details his record of leadership and integrity, which Google consistently recognized for over 15 years. We are disappointed by Google's refusal to take accountability and look forward to vindicating Mr. Olohan's rights,\" Olohan's attorney, Alex Rissmiller, said Wednesday in a statement to FOX Business.\n\nPOTENTIAL GOOGLE KILLER COULD CHANGE US WORKFORCE AS WE KNOW IT\n\nIn the wake of the lawsuit, Google has defended its decision to fire Olohan.\n\n\"This employee was terminated with cause after a thorough investigation of complaints by numerous employees,\" a Google spokesperson said Wednesday in a statement to FOX Business. \"We firmly stand by our decision here and we will vigorously defend ourselves against these claims.\"\n\nThe alleged harassment began in December 2019 when Adam Stewart, the Vice President of Google Consumer, Government & Entertainment, hosted an off-site dinner for approximately 15 employees at a restaurant in Manhattan.\n\nA man walks near Google offices in New York City. (Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress / Getty Images)\n\nAt the dinner, Miller allegedly approached Olohan and \"rubbed his stomach,\" telling him he had \"such a nice body,\" that he was handsome, that her own marriage \"lacked spice,\" and that she knew he liked Asian woman over White women, according to the filing. Because he was uncomfortable addressing the incident at the dinner because many employees, including his supervisor, Stewart, had been drinking, Olohan reported the incident a week later to Google Human Resources member Purnima Menon.\n\n\"Menon openly admitted to Olohan that if the complaint was 'in reverse' - a female accusing a White male of harassment - that the complaint would certainly be escalated,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe lawsuit says Google conducted no investigation regarding Olohan's complaint and Miller faced no formal repercussions.\n\n\"Following Olohan's rejection of Miller's sexual advances and report of the incident to Human Resources, Miller began to retaliate against him by criticizing him to other co-workers and complaining to Human Resources on at least two occasions about alleged 'microaggressions' from Olohan,\" according to the filing.\n\nThe exterior of the Google offices, located on 16th Street at 9th Avenue in the Meatpacking District in New York City. (George Rose/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nGoogle's Human Resources Business Partner, Jacky Schiestel, allegedly agreed that there were no \"microaggressions\" and Miller was just \"being petty.\"\n\n\"At another Google-hosted event, in December 2021, Miller was openly hostile to Olohan and drunkenly rebuked him at a table in front of numerous Google employees, loudly telling Olohan that she 'disagreed with him 70% of the time' and 'did not like him 70% of the time,'\" the lawsuit says. \"Noticing that she was intoxicated and causing a scene, two Google employees encouraged Miller to move to the other end of the table in an effort to stop her behavior.\"\n\nSchiestel was informed of the incident the next day by several Google employees, and Schiestel, Stewart and Miller scheduled separate meetings with Olohan to apologize for the drunken outburst.\n\nThe Google New York offices, Chelsea Market Space Ninth Avenue, in Manhattan. (Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\n\"In further retaliation against Olohan, Miller encouraged another Google employee, Stephanie Gatton, Administrative Business Professional to both Miller and Olohan, to complain to Human Resources that Olohan was not 'inclusive,' including in his planning an offsite event for his management team,\" the lawsuit says. \"The offsite event plans were reviewed with, and approved by, Human Resources and Stewart in advance on two separate occasions.\"\n\nPAUL PELOSI SOLD GOOGLE SHARES PRIOR TO DOJ ANTITRUST SUIT\n\nThe lawsuit details other incidents in the months leading up to his ultimate termination where Olohan was allegedly subjected to sexual harassment and disparate treatment because he refused to succumb to Miller's sexual advances and because he is a White male.\n\nIn February 2022, Stewart informed Olohan that there were \"obviously too many White guys\" on the CG&E management team, according to the filing. Then at an off-site event hosted by Stewart and his management team that ended at a karaoke bar in April, Miller allegedly mocked Olohan when he arrived late to the event and \"asked if he was at the gym again, building his muscles.\"\n\nFormer Google executive Ryan Olohan says he was sexually harassed by a female colleague. (Facebook / Fox News)\n\nAt the event, Miller allegedly told Olohan again that she \"knew he preferred Asian woman to White women\" and later, growing visibility intoxicated, \"berated Olohan in front of other Google employees,\" according to the lawsuit. Despite that other co-workers witnessed the behavior, Google again took no action.\n\n\"In June 2022, Schiestel informed Olohan that an employee had complained to Human Resources about him,\" the lawsuit says. \"Approximately three weeks later, Olohan informed Schiestel that the complaint was made at Miller's behest in retaliation for his refusing her sexual advances.\"\n\nThat summer, the filing says both Schiestel and Stewart strongly encouraged Olohan to hire only female applicants for an open management position on his team, and Human Resources and Stewart encouraged Olohan to terminate the employment of a male member of his team and to replace him with a female hire. The lawsuit, which involves an amount in controversy in excess of $75,000, alleged Olohan suffered damages, including lost earnings, lost benefits, other financial loss and emotional distress at the company in the months leading up to and because of his August termination.\n\nOlohan joined Google in January 2007 as an account executive. The suit notes he excelled in his role and received positive feedback based on his performance, including \"exceeds expectations\" or \"strongly exceeds expectations\" ratings in virtually every performance cycle until he was promoted to a certain level, when company policy requires executives to at the highest to receive \"meet expectations\" ratings.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Legal Statement .\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2025 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke formally announced Thursday that he'll seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, ending months of intense speculation over whether he'd try to translate his newfound political celebrity into a White House bid.\n\nUntil he challenged Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year, O'Rourke was little known outside his hometown of El Paso. But the Spanish-speaking 46-year-old former punk rocker became a sensation during a campaign that used grassroots organizing and social media savvy to mobilize young voters and minorities.\n\nHe got within 3 percentage points of upsetting Cruz in the nation's largest red state -- and shattered national fundraising records in the process -- immediately fueling chatter that he could have higher ambitions.\n\nNow O'Rourke must prove whether the energy he brought to the Texas campaign will resonate on a much larger stage. For all the buzz associated with his candidacy, the former three-term congressman hasn't demonstrated much skill in domestic or foreign policy. And, as a white man, he's entering a field that has been celebrated for its diverse roster of women and people and color.\n\n\"This is going to be a positive campaign that seeks to bring out the very best from every single one of us, that seeks to unite a very divided country,\" O'Rourke said in a video announcement with his wife on a couch. \"We saw the power of this in Texas.\"\n\nO'Rourke promises in the video posted Thursday: \"I'm going to travel this country and listen to those I seek to serve\" and then will return to El Paso on March 30 for a campaign kickoff. He invites would-be supporters \"to the greatest grassroots campaign this country has ever seen.\"\n\nO'Rourke joins a large and unsettled 2020 field in which his fundraising prowess, bipartisan optimism, southwestern Texas charm and anti-establishment attitude could quickly make him a political force. His lack of governing experience could hurt, but President Donald Trump's rise suggests that the U.S. electorate might welcome a charismatic outsider.\n\nThe sports and entertainment world already had its eye on O'Rourke during the Senate campaign: NBA star LeBron James wore an O'Rourke hat after video of the Texan defending NFL players' right to protest during the national anthem went viral. Beyonce, a Houston native, endorsed O'Rourke.\n\nAnd he was the only presidential prospect interviewed in February by Oprah Winfrey, who appeared genuinely excited about the prospect of an O'Rourke White House run.\n\nShould he parlay a 2018 Senate defeat into a successful 2020 White House campaign, O'Rourke would be the first U.S. politician to do so since Abraham Lincoln lost his Senate bid to Stephen Douglas in Illinois in 1858, then was elected president two years later.\n\nDemocrats have long dreamed that a booming Hispanic population and droves of Americans moving to Texas from elsewhere could turn the nation's largest red state blue and transform the Electoral College by making the Republican path to the presidency all but impossible.\n\nIt remains to be seen, though, whether O'Rourke's home-state appeal could truly make Texas competitive. Another Texan, former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro, was already running.\n\nTrump has repeatedly blasted the idea of an O'Rourke presidential try, calling him a \"flake\" and a \"total lightweight\" and joking, \"I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president.\"\n\nO'Rourke visited all 254 of Texas' counties while running for Senate and often drew larger-than-expected crowds, including in conservative areas that Democrats gave up on decades ago. It's a strategy that could serve him well in Iowa, which kicks off presidential voting and where Cruz campaigned in all 99 counties before winning its caucus during the 2016 GOP presidential primary.\n\nO'Rourke is scheduled to visit Iowa later Thursday and has three full days of political events planned there.\n\nThe Texan's advisers have reached out to early-state Democratic officials seeking advice for potential hires and strategy. And, in New Hampshire, home to the nation's first primary, an O'Rourke adviser asked for guidance on how they might schedule a driving tour through the state should he arrive coming from the West -- indicating that a cross-country trip of sorts might be part of a campaign rollout plan.\n\nAlthough he isn't among the first wave of Democrats to jump into the race, O'Rourke enters with strong national name recognition. Democratic operatives in states with early presidential primaries, including South Carolina and Nevada, have formed Draft Beto groups that spent months fundraising, lining up potential O'Rourke endorsements and building campaign infrastructure until their candidate was ready.\n\nA onetime guitarist for an El Paso punk band called Foss, O'Rourke boosted his already considerable nonpolitical street cred in the Senate race with a viral video showing him skateboarding across a Whataburger restaurant parking lot. His trademark black-and-white \"Beto for Senate\" signs became hipster must-haves last year in some parts of Seattle, Los Angeles and Brooklyn.\n\nO'Rourke refused support from outside political groups and shunned pollsters during his Senate campaign. But he harnessed growing nationwide popularity to rake in $80-plus million in donations, including a staggering $38 million from July to September 2018 alone.\n\nWhile challenging Cruz, O'Rourke insisted that he had no interest in running for president, vowing to quietly return to El Paso should he lose. But during his election night concession speech, he let rip the kind of casual swearing that freckled an unorthodox campaign, declaring to supporters on national television: \"All of you, showing the country how you do this, I'm so f---ing proud of you guys,\" before promising, \"We'll see you down the road.\"\n\nOther 2020 Democratic hopefuls have promoted their extensive legislative records. O'Rourke passed just three bills during his six years in Congress: two related to temporary health benefits and college tuition assistance to veterans and one renaming El Paso's federal courthouse.\n\nWhile running for Senate, he offered an unapologetically liberal vision, supporting Trump's impeachment, universal health care, gun control, marijuana decriminalization, steep federal subsidies for prekindergarten education and relaxed immigration policies. But he's drawn criticism from supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 Democratic presidential campaign who worry O'Rourke is too moderate to excite Democrats' liberal base.\n\nO'Rourke has shrugged off such complaints, saying he doesn't know if he's liberal enough to be called a \"progressive\" and doesn't much care for party labels. But it's a question he may not be able to duck forever, especially with Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary fray.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the Chuck Hagel Forum in Global Leadership, on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Omaha, in Omaha, Neb., Thursday, Feb. 28, 2019. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) ( AP )\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Former Vice President Joe Biden formally joined the crowded Democratic presidential contest on Thursday, declaring the soul of the nation at stake if President Donald Trump wins re-election.\n\nIn a video posted on Twitter , Biden focused on the 2017 deadly clash between white supremacists and counter protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Biden noted Trump's comments that there were some \"very fine people\" on both sides of the violent encounter, which left one woman dead.\n\n\"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\" Biden said. \"If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation - who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\"\n\nThe 76-year-old Biden becomes an instant front-runner alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is leading many polls and has proved to be a successful fundraiser. Among Democrats, Biden has unmatched international and legislative experience, and he is among the best-known faces in U.S. politics. He quickly racked up endorsements on Thursday morning, becoming the first Democrat running for president with the backing of more than one U.S. senator.\n\nStill, Biden must compete in a field that now spans at least 20 Democrats and has been celebrated for its racial and gender diversity. As an older white man with occasionally centrist views, Biden has to prove he's not out of step with his party. He's betting that his working-class appeal and ties to Barack Obama's presidency will help him overcome those questions.\n\nBiden has said he would campaign as an \"Obama-Biden Democrat,\" who is as pragmatic as he is progressive.\n\nJust minutes after the announcement, the GOP lashed out against Biden's record in the Obama administration, a line of attack in sharp contrast with recent criticism against other 2020 Democrats that has largely focused on them being too liberal, or even socialists.\n\n\"Biden's fingerprints are all over foreign policy blunders and the weakest economic recovery since World War II,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said. \"We don't need eight more years of Biden. Just ask President Obama, who isn't even endorsing his right-hand man.\"\n\nWhile it's true that Obama hasn't explicitly endorsed Biden's bid, the former president took the unusual step of weighing in on Thursday's announcement through a spokeswoman.\n\n\"President Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made,\" Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill said. \"He relied on the vice president's knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today.\"\n\nPrivately, Trump allies have warned that Biden might be the biggest re-election threat given the former vice president's potential appeal among the white working class in the Midwest, the region that gave Trump a path to the presidency.\n\nBiden is paying special attention to Pennsylvania, a state that swung to Trump in 2016 after voting for Democratic presidential candidates for decades.\n\nThe former vice president will be in the state three times within the opening weeks of his campaign. He'll be in Philadelphia on Thursday evening headlining a fundraiser at the home of David L. Cohen, executive senior vice president of Comcast. Biden is aiming to raise $500,000 at the event.\n\nHe will hold an event in Pittsburgh on Monday and will return to Philadelphia in the next two weeks for a major rally.\n\nHe's scheduled to make his first media appearance as a 2020 presidential contender Friday morning on ABC's \"The View,\" a move that may help him make an appeal to women whose support will be crucial to winning the primary.\n\nAs he neared his campaign launch, Biden's challenges have come into greater focus.\n\nHe struggled last month to respond to claims that he touched 2014 Nevada lieutenant governor nominee Lucy Flores' shoulders and kissed the back of her head before a fall campaign event. A handful of other women have made similar claims, though none has alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nBiden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware, pledged in an online video to be \"much more mindful\" of respecting personal space but joked two days later that he \"had permission\" to hug a male union leader before addressing the group's national conference.\n\nBiden also has been repeatedly forced to explain his 1991 decision, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, to allow Anita Hill to face difficult questions from an all-male panel about allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, who later was confirmed to the high court.\n\nHe has since apologized for his role in the hearing. But in the #MeToo era, particularly after the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the episode remains a significant political liability.\n\nLikewise, Biden once played a key role in anti-crime legislation that had a disproportionately negative impact on African Americans. And while several 2020 Democratic contenders have embraced the possibility of reparations to African Americans for slavery in recent weeks, Biden last month struggled to explain comments he made as a freshman senator in 1975 about the school busing debate.\n\nHis first White House bid in 1988 ended after a plagiarism scandal. He dropped out of the 2008 race after earning less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses. Later that year, Obama named Biden as his running mate.\n\n___\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.\"\n\nObama's remarks came during an interview out Monday with comedian Marc Maron for his popular podcast, where crude language is often part of the discussion.\n\nThe president said while attitudes about race have improved significantly since he was born to a white mother and black father, the legacy of slavery \"casts a long shadow and that's still part of our DNA that's passed on.\"\n\nObama also expressed frustration that \"the grip of the NRA on Congress is extremely strong\" and prevented gun control from advancing in Congress after 20 children and six educators were massacred in a Connecticut elementary school in 2012.\n\n\"I will tell you, right after Sandy Hook, Newtown, when 20 6-year-olds are gunned down, and Congress literally does nothing - yes, that's the closest I came to feeling disgusted,\" he said. \"I was pretty disgusted.\"\n\nHe said it's important to respect that hunting and sportsmanship are important to a lot of gun-owning Americans. \"The question is just is there a way of accommodating that legitimate set of traditions with some common-sense stuff that prevents a 21-year-old who is angry about something or confused about something, or is racist, or is deranged from going into a gun store and suddenly is packing, and can do enormous harm,\" Obama said in a reference to suspect Dylann Storm Roof, whose purported 2,500-word hate-filled manifesto talked about white supremacy. Roof faces nine counts of murder in connection with Wednesday's shooting.\n\nObama sat for the interview Friday in Maron's Los Angeles garage studio - close to where the president attended Occidental College - and seemed to marvel at the absurdity of it. \"If I thought to myself that when I was in college that I'd be in a garage a couple miles away from where I was living, doing an interview as president, with a comedian ... it's not possible to imagine,\" he said. But he said he did the interview because he wants to reach a nontraditional audience and \"break out of these old patterns that our politics has fallen into\" where \"it's not this battle in a steel cage between one side and another.\"\n\nWith the campaign to replace him heating up, Obama said he thinks he would be a better candidate if he were running again, because although he's slowed down a little bit, \"I know what I'm doing and I'm fearless.\"\n\n\"I've screwed up. I've been in the barrel tumbling down Niagara Falls. And I emerged and I lived. And that's always such a liberating feeling,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Nedra Pickler on Twitter at https://twitter.com/nedrapickler\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that this is not the first presidential podcast.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio's son, Dante, who starred in one of the most notable political ads in New York City history, will be attending Yale University this fall.\n\nDante's mother, Chirlane McCray, made the announcement Wednesday morning via Twitter. She wrote, \"So excited for your next adventure, Dante. #bulldogs2019.\"\n\nShe also posted a photo of her smiling son holding a Yale sweatshirt.\n\nDante, now 17, became a familiar face to New Yorkers during the stretch run of the 2013 mayoral campaign. His father, then the public advocate, had languished in fourth place for months leading up to that September's Democratic primary.\n\nBut as some of the leading candidates - including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and former congressman Anthony Weiner - saw their bids collapse, the de Blasio team put out an ad that changed the course of the campaign.\n\nBill de Blasio, a white man married to a black woman, had railed against what he deemed the overuse of stop and frisk, a police tactic that allowed officers to stop anyone they deemed suspicious. Its critics charged that it discriminated against black and Latino men.\n\nBut the argument really resonated when his teenage son, who identifies as black and sports a distinctive Afro, made the same case.\n\n\"He is the only one who will end a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color,\" Dante said in the ad's voiceover. \"Bill de Blasio will be a mayor for every New Yorker, no matter where they live or what they look like, and I'd say that even if he weren't my dad.\"\n\nAfter that ad aired, the son became nearly as big of a star as the father, drawing louder cheers at that year's West Indian Day Parade than the candidate. Bill de Blasio then captured the party's primary and breezed to a general election victory.\n\nDante was at the center of another political debate over police and community relations last December. After a grand jury declined to indict the white police officer who placed Eric Garner, who was black, in a fatal chokehold, the mayor publicly recalled having to warn Dante about the potential dangers of an encounter with police.\n\nThose comments were seized on by the police unions and were at the heart of a cold war between City Hall and many New York Police Department officers.\n\nBut Dante de Blasio's actual appearances in the public eye have been rare since his father took office. He has largely focused on his studies at Brooklyn Tech High School, one of the city's elite public high schools. He and a classmate captured the state high school debate championship in March.\n\nHis older sister, Chiara, attends Santa Clara University in California.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

The plate, which is not associated with a Volvo, may no longer be on the vehicle,\" the FBI said.\n\nThe suspect could also have some experience with metal work and welding, the bureau said.\n\nVideo footage of the incident saw the driver appear to light an incendiary device that they proceeded to drop in the ballot box, which began smoking and spark briefly. However, fire suppressants prevented serious damage. The incendiary devices are believed to have been inscribed with \"Free Gaza\" and \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nThe incidents occurred after the intelligence community warned Americans in July about the threats of explosive or incendiary devices being dropped in ballot boxes this November.\n\nMisty Severi is an evening news reporter for Just The News.

The sole controller handled air traffic for both planes and helicopters during the collision.\n\nThe major lawsuit was filed on behalf of Andrew Brigida, a white man who claimed that he was discriminated against based on his race, after he was rejected for an air traffic control job despite graduating from Arizona State University's training initiative in 2013, and scoring 100% on his training exam, according to the New York Post .\n\nThe lawsuit centers on allegations that the FAA, during the Obama administration, dropped a skill-based system for hiring controllers and replaced it with a \"biographical assessment\" to boost the number of minority applicants.\n\nThe FAA dropped the biographical assessment in 2018 and all applicants must take the Air Traffic Skills Assessment (ATSA) now.\n\n\"Every FAA-certified air traffic controller has gone through months of screening and training at the FAA Academy, and that is before another 18-24 months of training to learn specific regions and airspaces,\" the FAA told Fox Business in 2024. \"There is a well-known national shortage of air traffic controllers, and the FAA has ramped up outreach to ensure no talent is left on the table.\n\n\"We are accelerating the pace of recruiting, training, and hiring to meet demand, while maintaining the highest qualification standards,\" the administration added.\n\nMisty Severi is a news reporter for Just The News.

Garrett is \"aware of quite a few forthcoming suits.\"\n\nVice President John Corkins even compared RIFL faculty to his livestock, saying \"we have to continue to cull\" them in a December 2022 board meeting, though he later apologized.\n\nA federal court greenlit Johnson's suit last fall and blocked KCCD's enforcement of the state's diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility regulations against Johnson's speech, including his planned recommendation of Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's book on defeating \"cultural Marxism\" - a phrase called \"hate speech\" in Garrett's termination notice .\n\nNondisclosure agreements \"may have been used to address still other cases\" under Ali, whose tenure is marked by \"noticeable turnover in HR\" and \"low morale and widespread fear of administrative retaliation\" as documented in the 2024 Workplace Culture Survey, \"with some citing HR as a significant factor,\" Garrett wrote to the trustees.\n\nAli violated \"California legal standards\" by not consulting Garrett on allegations presented to the board in April 2023 , which were \"often disproven by unambiguous evidence,\" and the survey shows faculty concerns that Ali has turned a blind eye to \"seemingly protected bad actors who seem to disrupt the workplace with impunity,\" as with the allegations against Garrett, he said.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Ali's new contract \"exceeds the KCCD salary schedule maximum by $40,000,\" Garrett said.\n\nJust the News asked KCCD for its response to Garrett's allegations and documents, including what bearing they might have on Ali's contract extension and Parks' status.\n\n\"Kern Community College District unequivocally supports the right for our students and faculty to share their views and opinions on campus and elsewhere,\" spokesperson Norma Rojas wrote in an email. \"As a District, we create an environment that provides our diverse students and communities with the opportunity to professionally engage with new ideas.\"\n\nKCCD \"does not have further comment\" on personnel matters, however, she said.\n\nGarrett told Just the News he obtained Parks' testimony in his administrative trial from someone who filed a public records request for it specifically. He requested \"all trial transcripts\" but KCCD has yet to turn over any, he said.\n\nParks is the founder and coordinator of BC's affiliate of Umoja, whose stated mission is \"enhancing the cultural and educational experiences of African American and other students.\"\n\nHer affiliate, however, is secondarily named \"African-American Success Through Excellence and Persistence ,\" and unlike some other affiliates that explicitly state they are open to all students, BC's Umoja does not except in an image from Umoja on every affiliate's page.\n\nThe BC program \"integrates academics, support services and African-American culture,\" it says. \"African and African-American histories and voices are deliberately and intentionally acknowledged and are woven into the learning experience.\"\n\nParks testified that she told students about Garrett and RIFL because of its Facebook page, which he managed at the time. (The college subjected Johnson to a five-month investigation for his own management of the page, which he took over after Garrett's suspension.)\n\nSome RIFL posts said \"there are classes where white people couldn't be in the classes,\" which was accusing Parks and BC of \"breaking the law\" and \"maligning the [Umoja] statewide organization,\" which thought she was violating Umoja's mission, Parks said. She emphasized a white man was one of the founders.\n\nThey also \"misrepresented\" its study space, known as a \"village,\" as black-only, Parks said. Garrett had encouraged \"white people to go to the space and see if they'll be turned away,\" which made it \"not really a safe space\" because visitors might \"act on those lies.\"\n\nParks then invited the students to attend the regularly scheduled October 2022 meeting of the Equal Opportunity and Diversity Advisory Committee. RIFL members including Garrett had taken over the first-come, first-serve committee by signing up as soon as slots opened, then slowed down its work, twice upsetting progressive faculty.\n\nShe wanted them to see her propose the racial climate task force, which might usurp the committee's jurisdiction, and warned they might hear negative comments about it. Parks said she didn't tell students they might hear negative comments from Garrett or RIFL members.\n\nWhile one committee member cursed when Parks entered with a group of students, the RIFL bloc simply grilled her about the rigor of her evidence and whether it justified her proposal, according to a surreptitious recording of the 79-minute meeting Just the News reviewed.\n\nIt seems to contradicted students' subsequent allegations against Garrett, particularly that he disparaged Parks, much less referred to her or her teaching or made racially directed comments. (Garrett included his full statement from the meeting in a cheat sheet on Parks' testimony.)\n\nHe did say that \"safe spaces\" can create more racial \"animosity\" than they resolve, which Parks apparently interpreted as a reference to the Umoja village. Parks agreed when asked whether students were made \"uncomfortable or unsafe\" by Garrett's comment in the meeting.\n\nAfter the committee meeting, Parks convened an Umoja \"porch\" - an open discussion forum - at a student's request. She said \"we spent at least an hour with them talking about the meeting,\" delaying her Umoja-tailored English class by an hour, \"because they were so upset\" by \"the way people looked at them\" in the meeting, which \"made them feel uncomfortable and unsafe.\"\n\nStudents also discussed the meeting at the village, with similar sentiments about \"how the environment was racist,\" Parks said. She agreed when asked whether she had students \"write letters after this experience\" - five or six did so - because \"their minds were fresh.\"\n\nSome letters were sent to the Academic Senate and trustees, and Parks admitted asking students to share their perspectives at both entities' meetings. She spoke to the trustees so they would know how RIFL was \"impacting myself, the program, and especially my students.\" (Corkins made his \"cull\" comment at the end of that meeting.)\n\nParks said she gave interviews to two \"print outlets\" - one of them, the national Inside Higher Ed - and two local TV stations about Garrett and RIFL before Fox News reported on the controversy Jan. 17, 2023, but said they reached out to her."

The signing will occur on the 116th anniversary of the riot, and the ceremony will include civil rights leaders and elected officials.\n\nThe riot began when 5,000 white men gathered outside of a jail in Springfield and demanded jailers turn over two black men who were accused of rape and murder. One man was accused of raping a white woman, while the other was accused of killing a white man. However, the jailers had already moved the men to a jail in Bloomington.\n\nThe rioters decided to flood a black neighborhood since the men were moved, which resulted in the deaths of eight black men, five white men, and the destruction of roughly 35 black-owned businesses.\n\nThe rioters also looted a white business that helped jailers move the black suspects.\n\nGeorge Richardson, who was accused of raping the white woman, was released after the woman recanted the allegations, but Joe James, who was accused of murder, was convicted and hanged. The riot occurred between Aug. 14-16.\n\n\"The monument is a poignant reminder of the devastation Springfield and the nation faced during a time of racial violence,\" Illinois Lt. Gov.  Juliana Stratton said in a statement, per CBS News. \"We honor the memories of the lives that were tragically cut short, the families irrevocably shattered, and the businesses destroyed.\"\n\nThe designation comes as scrutiny over race returns to Illinois, after a white former sheriff's deputy allegedly killed a black woman who called 911 over a suspected prowler.

One of the men writes a letter to Santa stating, \"Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is you.\"\n\nPublished: December 6, 2021 9:51pm\n\nUpdated: December 6, 2021 11:14pm\n\nNothing and no one, factual or fictional, is immune, it seems, from the forces of woke revisionism - not even Santa Claus, the personification of the Christmas season, whose iconic image has taken shape through centuries of folklore and commercial advertising, primarily in Europe and North America.\n\nSanta Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or Santa, has been known worldwide as a rotund, jolly white man with a bushy, white beard. Dressed in a red and white suit, wearing a black belt buckle and black boots, he drives a sleigh pulled by reindeer to bring children all over the world gifts solely on Christmas Eve.\n\nAccording to various traditions, parents leave out milk and cookies, and the next day, on Christmas morning, children are told Santa came by, drank the milk and ate the cookies, and left them presents.\n\nA well-known song that saturates the airwaves in the weeks prior to Christmas warns that \"Santa is coming to town\" to judge children who are \"naughty or nice,\" encouraging them to behave in order to get presents. (Naughty children, and adults, get a lump of coal.)\n\nBut Norwegian children may encounter a different version this Christmas, through a national advertising campaign portraying Santa as a gay man.\n\nNorway's national postal service, Posten, publishes a Santa-themed ad every year. This one depicts two adult men kissing, with one dressed like Santa. In the video , one of the men writes a letter to Santa stating, \"Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is you.\"\n\nThe ad, entitled, \"When Harry Met Santa,\" is a play on words alluding to the title of the popular romantic comedy featuring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nThe ad ends with a statement noting that by next Christmas in 2022 Norway will mark the 50th anniversary of \"being able to love whoever we want,\" a reference to its government decriminalizing homosexuality 50 years ago next year.\n\n\"It has been a dark year for everyone - A global pandemic, code red for our planet, refugee crisis and more,\" Monica Solberg, Posten's marketing director, told  told LGBTQ Nation . \"Perhaps what we need this year is a warm and heartfelt love story? A celebration of the fact that we can love whomever we want in Norway, despite everything bad that happens around the world.\"\n\nLast year's ad depicted Santa being angry with Posten for taking business away from him, Solberg said.\n\nWhile some praised the ad, others criticized it. British singer Steve Brookstein tweeted,\n\n\"Norway making Santa a closet homosexual cheating on Mrs. Claus is the worst Christmas idea....EVER!\"\n\nThe ad comes not long after a New Zealand shopping center made headlines for unveiling a \"gender fluid\" Santa in its Christmas display - and amid ongoing debate over the gender of his reindeer.\n\nPonsonby Central in Auckland in 2018 hoisted a giant Santa on top of its building, with an exposed fat belly protruding from a red coat, wearing fishnet stockings.\n\n\"The Coca-Cola company doesn't have a monopoly on what he/she looks like,\" Ponsonby said of its display at the time, alluding to a series of commercial illustrations commissioned by the Coca-Cola company in 1931 that did much to crystallize the modern image of Santa.\n\nThose paintings, by illustrator Haddon Sundblom, \"established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines,\" as Coca-Cola claims on its website. Sundblom's Santa was inspired by an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \"A Visit from St. Nicholas,\" popularly known as \"Twas the Night Before Christmas.\"\n\nAlso in 2018, logo design firm GraphicSprings conducted a survey to gauge the public's view on Santa's gender. Among its sample of 400 American and British adults, the majority, 70%, said Santa should be a man.\n\nYears before this, a topic pondered by wildlife experts and American academics was that of the gender of Santa's fictional reindeer.\n\n\"Santa's reindeers were really females, most likely,\" Alice Blue-McLendon, a veterinary medicine professor at Texas A&M specializing in deer, told Fox News in 2008.\n\nHer analysis was based on the size of the antlers depicted in literature, popular culture and movie images of Santa's sled-bearers, compared to real-life reindeer.\n\nBoth male and female reindeer grow antlers, but bulls typically shed them before Christmas.\n\nGreg Finstad, at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said Santa's reindeer might be castrated males, or steers, because people who sled in arctic temperatures usually use steers. Also, females might be pregnant and not able to pull a sleigh, since their three-month mating season usually runs from September through November.\n\nBlue-McLendon explained years later in another commentary that in some parts of the country, reindeers played an important role during the Christmas season. \"In the early days of Alaska's history, some mail routes were made with sleds pulled by reindeer, so it's likely they even delivered some Christmas cards, too,\" she said.\n\nThe American experts note there are two genders of reindeer: male and female. And only the female deer get pregnant, meaning, gender fluidity doesn't exist among reindeer, even among the fictional ones pulling Santa's sleigh."

The documents also state that she went on vacations with Wade using funds that his firm received from his work on the Trump case.\n\n\"Cases are not lost because of some 'Matlock' moment, some moment like you see in 'My Cousin Vinny,' where suddenly somebody finds the evidence.

      "text": "Democratic lawmaker Jasmine Crockett rants about 'the white man' during a hearing on the Dismantle DEI Act\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) became upset during a House hearing Wednesday, which led her to rant about how white men were never oppressed in the United States.\n\nDuring a House Oversight Committee hearing about the \"Dismantle DEI Act,\" which seeks to weaken diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, Crockett responded to a Republican colleague championing the bill as a \"strong response to the oppression of our rights, liberties and freedoms.\"\n\nCrockett strongly objected to Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) using the word \"oppression.\"\n\n\"You consistently said over and over the word 'oppression,' and every time that you said it, it was almost as if I was hearing nails on a chalkboard, because it seems like you don't understand the definition of 'oppression.' And I'd ask you to just refer to Google to help you out. Oppression is the prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control. That is the definition of oppression,\" she said. \"And so, as I sit here as a black woman who practiced civil rights, let me tell you the reason that my colleagues wanted to make sure you understood the same black history that your side of the aisle wants to delete out of classrooms is because you can then misuse words like 'oppression.'\"\n\nCrockett argued that white men in the United States haven't faced oppression because they weren't forced off their lands and sent to a foreign country as slaves.\n\n\"There has been no oppression for the white man in this country. You tell me which white men were dragged out of their homes. You tell me which one of them got dragged all the way across an ocean and told that 'You are going to go to work. We are going to steal your wives. We are going to rape your wives.' That didn't happen. That is oppression,\" Crockett said.\n\n\"We didn't ask to be here. We're not the same migrants that y'all constantly come up against. We didn't run away from home. We were stolen. So yeah, we are going to sit here and be offended when you want to sit here and act like ... and don't let it escape you that it is white men on this side of the aisle telling us, people of color on this side of the aisle that y'all are the ones being oppressed, that y'all are the ones that are being harmed. That's not the definition of oppression. You tell me the prolonged, cruel or unjust treatment that you've had and we can have a conversation.\"\n\nCrockett pointed to how white men only comprise 30% of the country's population but hold over 60% of elected offices.\n\n\"I can't even tell you how many white men have served in this chamber. But I can tell you that I am only the 55th black woman to be elected to Congress. And so when you want to talk about history and pretend as if it was so long ago, it wasn't,\" she said. \"Because again, I am just number 55.\"\n\nShe concluded her remarks by claiming \"companies with more diverse workforces are more likely to outperform their competitors.\"\n\n\"Diversity works, and until you can show me data that says otherwise, I think that we need to go back to being a country that listens to experts and gets out of our feelings and recognizes again that racism is real in this country, and until we stop pretending that it's not, we will not solve the problems that we are consistently facing. And that will bring real unity that we seek when we're looking for a more perfect union,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement"

So, white men are becoming extinct in the workplace. Does that sound like a lawsuit to you? These are the horrible questions you have to ask in these horrific times.\n\nDiversity and inclusion initiatives are taking a hit right now in the media. Unfortunately, the intent of these programs is getting lost in the rancor and divisiveness in our culture.\n\nIt's hard to deny the benefits of having a diverse workforce - meaning every dimension of diversity, including thought and perspective, not just gender and race. However, when not incorporated or communicated equitably, it can leave many feeling excluded and angry.\n\nThe law protects everyone from discrimination, even employees who have historically been entrenched in the majority, such as white men.\n\nThey are also entitled to protection under any laws that were intended to assure equal treatment for women and racial minorities. Whether or not you have a lawsuit based on your particular circumstance is a question for a lawyer.\n\nI went on a business trip and then took a mini vacation after the trip, before flying home. I expensed my flight back, and my employer declined the expense because I came home from vacation, not business. Is this right?\n\nDid your employer plan to leave you stranded wherever they sent you on your trip? They have an obligation to bring you home, even if you decide to take a detour after the business trip for a little personal excursion - the obligation is still your employer's to get you back home.\n\nHowever, they are not obligated to pay more to bring you back, either because you're coming from a different destination or on a different day, making their cost more to fly you home from your business trip.\n\nIf your return flight from your mini vacay is more, then you should pay the airfare difference. Additionally, any expenses you incur after the business purpose of your travel, whether meals, hotel or anything, are fully yours.\n\nGregory Giangrande has over 25 years of experience as a chief human resources executive.

And for 250 years, it has been mediocre White men who have been hired based on their skin color.\"\n\n\"And those are facts. - I've heard people say DEI is racist. If that's what you believe, you know nothing about diversity, equity, inclusion, and you know nothing about racism. And that speaks to you as a human being.\"\n\nSpeaking about Wake County as a whole, which includes Raleigh as well as Fuquay-Varina and Zebulon, Hershey said DEI ensures kids who need more educational help receive it without lowering standards.\n\n\"That's the thing that drives me nuts the most,\" Hershey said.\n\n\"That's being real. And I've said this before: People who throw around ' DEI hire ,' they're just replacing the n-word with 'DEI hire.' That's what they want to say. We get it. You guys are all losers.\"\n\nHe referenced the recent helicopter-plane collision above Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia, where some pundits were hypothesizing about the personal identifiers of the pilots involved.\n\n\"Should I see a Black pilot or do I think they're a DEI hire? No, that's racism to think that way.\"\n\nIn Wake County Schools, he said, candidates are hired based on their qualifications and that it would be insulting not to do so.\n\n\"We've got vacancies, so we're not turning away people because they're White,\" he said.\n\nA communications official for Wake County Schools told Fox News Digital, \"I don't have any information to share with you,\" when reached on Thursday.\n\nSuperintendent Robert Taylor did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and several assistant superintendents, as well as Hershey, did not respond to emailed inquiries whether any reprimand or other action was being considered because of his remarks.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, Hershey's comments led to criticism, including one user who asked if he had ever listened to speeches from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"What happened to a world where one is not judged by the color of his skin (or other immutable outward characteristics for that matter?). Why should anyone consider skin color in hiring?\"\n\n\"Sam Hershey has decades of experience in 'white man mediocrity,\" another user wrote. \"Not exactly the best and brightest Wake County has to offer.\""

      "text": "Daniel Penny labeled 'the white man' by prosecutor at racially charged manslaughter trial\n\nOn day two of his manslaughter case , Daniel Penny ceased having a name.\n\nHe became merely \"the white man.\"\n\nDuring the prosecution's opening statements on Friday, they asked why Penny, 26, did \"not see Mr. Neely's humanity.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Marine Corps veteran - facing 15 years for the subway chokehold that killed mentally ill homeless man Jordan Neely - was reduced by the same prosecution to his race and sex.\n\nOver and over.\n\nThis started when 19-year-old Ivette Rosario, a bystander on the train that day, was called to the stand. Rosario, appearing visibly shy and nervous, captured a short, shaky video of Penny holding Neely in a chokehold on the uptown F train.\n\nIt became clear that Rosario, whose voice at times was barely audible, did not know Penny's name, so she referred to him as \"the white guy.\"\n\nBut she was not corrected by Assistant DA Jillian Shartrand, nor did the lawyer inform Rosario of the defendant's name. Instead, Shartrand adopted it as her own, calling him \"the white man.\"\n\nShartrand continued to question Rosario, referring to the defendant as such, more than a half a dozen times. It was jarring to hear it repeated so casually.\n\nGiven the racial undertones of the case, with BLM protesters hurling accusations of Penny being a \"racist vigilante,\" it felt doubly reckless. Even if it wasn't wholly malicious.\n\nIn fact, when Penny's defense attorney, Thomas Kenniff, got up to cross-examine Rosario, his client's name was the first order of business. He clarified that \"the white man\" was indeed his client and kindly agreed with Rosario that they'd refer to him as \"Danny\" and Neely as \"Jordan.\"\n\nThus, \"Danny\" - sitting almost motionless in court - was finally back in the room.\n\nSo was the fear that Rosario, a regular subway rider, felt on May 1, 2023. The Bronx resident testified that she, like most New Yorkers, has seen her share of underground nonsense and \"situations,\" she said, pointedly adding, \"But not like that\" - not like Neely's outburst when he boarded the train at 2 Avenue. According to witnesses , Neely said \"someone is going to die today\" and that he was \"ready to go to Rikers\" prison.\n\nAnd on that short but harrowing ride, she testified, she was so nervous that she buried her head in her friend's chest and thought she might pass out.\n\n\"I got scared by the tone. It was an angry tone,\" she said of Neely's voice and threats of violence.\n\nRosario's footage, which was shown to the jury, darted around, barely capturing a clear shot of Penny and Neely, their figures obscured by her friend's coat.\n\nThe one object that was very much in focus: Rosario's non-recording hand, shaking violently in the frame.\n\nIn the video, one onlooker can be heard saying, \"He's dying - you gotta let go!\" as another said, \"Let him go.\"\n\nShe told jurors, \"Yeah, you can hear it in the video, but in the moment, I couldn't hear it in the moment.\"\n\nLater, the jury was shown a far more graphic video, this one shot by Mexican journalist Juan Alberto Vazquez, who lives in Brooklyn. Through a translator, he testified that his journalistic instincts kicked in, leading him to film Penny holding Neely as the struggle ensued - and another man helped to restrain Neely's arms.\n\nThe unfolding horror and tragedy understandably proved too much for Neely's father, Andre Zachary, who left the courtroom as it played for the jury.\n\nFor his part, Penny seemed to be staring straight ahead, briefly glancing toward the large screen for a split second before his head almost reflexively snapped back.\n\nIt'd be easier for us to all look away. Ignore how our city's disastrous, \"compassionate\" policies toward the mentally ill and unhinged violent drug users have endangered everyday New Yorkers.\n\nBut one man didn't look away during the chaos. And he's standing trial for it.\n\nAdvertisement"

The expansive complex is projected to be Illinois' biggest casino, boasting a 500-room hotel tower with a rooftop bar, a riverwalk, thousands of slot machines and a 3,000-seat theater. Bally's will be the city's first casino; its bid was selected by then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2022.\n\nAs part of the Host Community Agreement Bally's signed with the city of Chicago, the casino committed to 25% minority ownership. The HCA was drafted in accordance with a 2019 state law expanding gambling in Illinois. Currently, in order to take part in the casino's $250 million initial public offering, one must meet its \"Class A Qualification Criteria,\" part of which states that an investor must be a \"minority or woman.\"\n\nA minority is defined as \"African-Americans, American Indians, Asian-Americans, Hispanics\" and other groups deemed by the city to be \"socially disadvantaged\" including Arab Americans, per the Municipal Code of Chicago.\n\nThe Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty is suing Bally's Casino and members of the Illinois gaming commission for what they allege is racial discrimination. WILL is representing two would-be investors who say they were denied the ability to take part in the project because of their race - Richard Fisher and Phillip Aronoff - who are part of the American Alliance for Equal Rights, which is also a plaintiff in the case.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Bally's is in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the first Ku Klux Klan Act and years of Supreme Court precedent by preventing White men from buying stock in their company. The suit also alleges that Bally's is preventing shareholders from transferring shares to people who do not meet \"Class A\" criteria.\n\n\"Making a contract is essential to the rights of citizenship. What Bally's is doing here is absolutely illegal and has been for decades and decades,\" Dan Lennington of the Wisconsin Institute of Law and Liberty told Fox News Digital.\n\nChicago attorney Patrick Callahan is not a party to the lawsuit, but he told Fox News Digital he was unable to invest in the project because he is a White man.\n\n\"It's so blatantly discriminatory, I can't imagine how that could possibly be permissible,\" Callahan said.\n\nCallahan, 39, said he first heard about the casino from a realtor he follows on Instagram. He thought it was an exciting investment opportunity and attempted to buy shares in the project. After filling out his personal information on the Bally's investment portal, he was asked if he met the \"Class A\" criteria. When Callahan input that he did not, due to his race and gender, he said the portal stated that he could not proceed with his investment.\n\n\"This offering is only available to entities who satisfy Class A Qualification Criteria in accordance with the Host Community Agreement with the city of Chicago,\" the portal displayed in red text.\n\n\"I assumed that it was more of a guideline than a hard rule... this can't actually be... but sure enough this is exclusively available to women and certain minorities,\" Callahan told Fox News Digital.\n\nCallahan said that the alleged racial discrimination was far from shocking given how the city has been run under Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, but he was still alarmed.\n\n\"It didn't surprise me as much as it was kind of startling because it was just so blatant... Chicago is a mess so it doesn't surprise me,\" he said.\n\nWILL's lawsuit could lead to legal consequences for Bally's that may even put its casino license in jeopardy, Lennington said.\n\nBally's SEC filing stated the terms they agreed to in the HCA could leave them vulnerable to lawsuits from people who don't meet \"Class A\" criteria, which would incur \"substantial costs\" from the casino and \"could adversely affect our ability to operate our casinos and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,\" should the HCA be found invalid or unconstitutional.\n\n\"The Bally's Chicago IPO complies with our obligations under the Host Community Agreement with the City of Chicago,\" a Bally's spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\nThe Chicago Mayor's Office and Illinois Gaming Commission did not respond to Fox News Digital's request to comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

The work consists of a 70-second looped video showing an average-looking white man in white button-down shirt and black pants, expressionless, standing on an auction block in the middle of a busy Brooklyn intersection.\n\nBlack pedestrians wearing coronavirus masks pass him by. The scene was shot at Flatbush and Church Avenues.\n\n\"The White Male for Sale NFT makes the medium itself an inherent and essential part of the conceptual project,\" Scott, 56, said in an explanation of his work on Instagram. \"People are inherently non-fungible. But as slavery became an integral part of developing capitalism, enslavers sought to turn people into commodities and make them fungible.\"\n\nAn NFT is a unique and non-transferable data unit that can be stored on a digital ledger known as a blockchain - the same technology which powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nChristie's refused to speculate about what it might sell for but the auction house has developed a niche in America's burgeoning NFT marketplace. In March the company sold an NFT by the digital artist Mike Winkelmann (aka Beeple) for $69 million.\n\nScott did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Post, but he told Art Net that his work could be worth north of $2 million - suggesting he has made peace with at least some parts of capitalism.\n\n\"While Male for Sale\" will be auctioned on Oct. 1 in at Christie's auction house at 20 Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nThe work has already stirred controversy among fellow artists, like Manhattan painter David Paul Kay , who blasted the NFT as \"cheap\" and \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"He is just trying to cash out. This is not fixing the problem he is talking about. It's literally making it worse,\" Kay, who is white, told The Post. \"This guy is just an opportunist. I don't like to bash other artists. I don't like to do that.\"\n\nIt's far from Scott's first controversy. Past works featured on his website include \"Burning the Constitution,\" and \"Perpetual 911,\" which repeatedly shows a plane crashing into and then reversing out of 2 World Trade Center.\n\n\"I don't accept the economic foundation, the social relations or the governing ideas of America,\" Scott said in a 2018 TED talk .\n\nA 1989 piece, \"What Is the Proper Way to Display an American Flag?\" featured the flag laid out on the floor so people could step on it. The exhibit was condemned by then-President George H.W. Bush after being displayed in Chicago at the School of the Art Institute. The Senate subsequently passed a bill forbidding the piece from being shown again.\n\n\"I signed on to [the bill]. We don't need people desecrating the flag. It's wrong and morally reprehensible,\" retired New York Sen. Al D'Amato told The Post."

Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) argued in a letter addressed just to \"White People\" on Tuesday that \"white supremacy\" is the reason Daniel Penny was acquitted in the subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely.\n\nIn the bizarre rant, posted on X, the departing \"Squad\" lawmaker further suggested that he doesn't understand why he feels the need to \"keep talking\" to white people.\n\n\"Dear White People,\" Bowman's manifesto begins.\n\n\"I don't know why I feel the need to keep talking to you. I don't know why part of me still has hope for you and for us. Some of you are too far gone. But maybe enough of you aren't and will join us in fighting to end white supremacy,\" the congressman writes.\n\nBowman, 48, goes on to spotlight several high-profile cases of police violence against black men and women, as well as the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin by Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman - who was also acquitted of wrongdoing .\n\n\"White supremacy is not skin color. It's a state of mind,\" the Bronx and Westchester rep argues after referencing the death of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten by five black Memphis Police Department officers.\n\n\"Jordan Neely is the latest,\" Bowman adds. \"He was sick. He was not a threat. He was subdued. Still not a threat. Daniel Penny choked him for 6 minutes. And killed him. We all watched it on camera, and he was still acquitted.\"\n\nA community note appended to the tweet thread noted: \"As part of a plea agreement, after punching a 67-year-old woman in 2021, Jordan Neely was given free access to stable housing and healthcare at a treatment facility. Neely abandoned the facility after 13 days.\"\n\nX users also added: \"Penny's actions were in response to Neely threatening passengers.\"\n\nNew York's 16th District pol then asserts that white social media users have \"never\" seen \"a white man killed in cold blood on camera on your newsfeed.\"\n\n\"How many times have you even heard about this? The answer is never. You never have,\" Bowman declares.\n\n\"And whenever you feel discomfort from your whiteness, Black people are harmed or killed,\" he charges. \"And there is never accountability or justice. This is the evil of white supremacy. It spans across geography and political parties and sickens us all.\"\n\n\"RIP Jordan Neely. The justice system failed you. Kyle Ritenhouse [sic] and Daniel Penny are free. You're gone. We must still fight,\" Bowman's missive ends.\n\nPenny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide by a Manhattan jury on Monday.\n\nProsecutors argued that Penny was \"criminally reckless\" when he held Neely, who witnesses said was scaring passengers, in an approximately six-minute-long chokehold.\n\nDefense attorneys raised doubts about whether Neely died from the chokehold, citing his schizophrenia, drug use and a genetic health condition.\n\nBowman was defeated by Westchester County Executive George Latimer in New York's 16th District Democratic primary earlier this year.\n\nThe former Bronx middle school principal faced criticism for opposing Israel's war against Hamas and for infamously yanking a fire alarm in a Capitol office building in September 2023.\n\nBowman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, agreed to a $1,000 fine and was later censured by the House over the fire alarm pull.\n\nHe claimed at the time that he \"thought the alarm would open the door\" and pulled it by \"accident,\" saying he \"was just trying to get to my vote\" for a critical government funding package.\n\nLatimer went on to easily beat Republican Miriam Flisser in the general election and will replace Bowman in the House of Representatives next month.\n\nAdvertisement"

The billionaire NBA owner took to X to promote how it helps corporations flourish, succeed, and prosper, including the NBA.\n\nSo it was shocking to see that Cuban and the DEI crowd did not celebrate or publicly acknowledge Mac McClung becoming the first white person in the history of the NBA to win the Slam Dunk Contest in consecutive years (and the first white man to win since 1996).\n\nI waited over a week to write this because I genuinely wanted to see if anyone would have acknowledged this milestone. I cannot say I am shocked that no one did.\n\nAnyone who watches sports or pays attention to pop culture can tell you that anytime a non-white athlete is the first (insert race here) to (insert sports accomplishment here), it receives widespread attention and praise. So then, why didn't McClung get the same kind of recognition? The answer: because he is a white male.\n\nAs much as anti-white stereotypes are allowed to exist in this country, the one about white men being unable to jump has been around for a long time. There was even a classic '90s comedy movie about it - two if you count the horrible 2023 remake - aptly titled White Men Can't Jump . If there were ever a true diversity accomplishment or milestone to celebrate, especially in sports, it would be a white man winning the NBA's Slam Dunk Contest, let alone in consecutive years.\n\nFurthermore, given that white men are a minority in the NBA, recognizing a racial minority's accomplishment would seem to be everything DEI enthusiasts want. Yet, unless I missed something, everyone failed to appreciate this momentous occasion. Why? As mentioned earlier, it's because McClung is a white man. See, diversity and inclusion really aren't about diversity and inclusion. It's a left-wing dog whistle, which truthfully means \"not white.\" It's a sociopolitical aspect of our culture that must stop.\n\nIf we want to live in a society where we celebrate diversity and acknowledge feats and milestones of people based on race, then fine. I have no qualms celebrating, recognizing, or acknowledging the first (insert race here) to accomplish (insert achievement here). But if we are going to do it, then do it for every race. Otherwise, failure to do so exposes the fraud behind diversity, equity, and inclusion . The sooner people realize that, the better."

      "text": "Why is it socially acceptable to ridicule white people based on their skin color?\n\nW ith all the (alleged) social justice activism recently, we are supposed to be living in a nirvana of racial equality. We are supposed to be sensitive to anything that could be perceived as a racial bias, as it could offend others. We were warned that what some find humorous, others may find hurtful and insulting, and we must curb our speech. And, in an effort to treat everyone fairly, we have been told we must stop the aggression in our speech - both micro and macro. Yet all of these guidelines get completely ignored when it comes to one specific group: white people.\n\nConsider the most recent comments made by basketball player Andre Iguodala on an episode of Point Forward , a podcast hosted by former basketball player Evan Turner. Iguodala marveled over the skills of Luka Doncic, a basketball player of Slovenian origin for the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\"Luka Doncic, this white boy is a problem, and it's getting to the point where I don't think he's white anymore,\" Iguodala said.\n\nWhile Iguodala meant this as a compliment, it still came with the implication that white people are inferior when it comes to basketball - and other athletics. Iguodala was surprised at Doncic's skill level because of his white skin color and couldn't believe a white person could be so good at basketball.\n\nBelieving a particular race is inferior - isn't there a word for that?\n\nMoreover, ignoring the negative profiling and stereotyping in Iguodala's comment, would this kind of comment be allowed if it was about a person of any other skin color? No, of course not. Yet Iguodala's remarks didn't cause any frenzy. This is because it is socially acceptable to mock and criticize white people in ways that, if the same comments were said about minorities, would be condemned as racist.\n\nConsider that Iguodala's comments come days after a white baseball player, Josh Donaldson, was criticized and punished for making \"racist\" comments by calling a black baseball player ... Jackie Robinson. Donaldson commented facetiously toward Chicago White Sox baseball player Tim Anderson in reference to his self-absorbed and narcissistic remarks in a 2019 Sports Illustrated interview . Donaldson was branded a bigot and forced to apologize. There's been zero outrage over Iguodala's comments.\n\nIguodala's negative stereotyping of white people's athletic abilities is nothing new. Many commentators, athletes, celebrities, comedians, etc. have insinuated or joked that white people are inferior athletes. It's permissible to ridicule based on one's skin color, just so long as the butt of the jokes is white people.\n\nAfter all, as I am sure Iguodala knows, there is a movie titled White Men Can't Jump , a personal favorite of mine, released all the way back in 1992. And, as further proof of this lack of racial sensitivity toward white people, they are even remaking this movie.\n\nConsider comedian Chris Rock's statements from the 88th Academy Awards in February 2016. When talking about the movie Creed , Rock made a joke about how the character Rocky Balboa couldn't exist because he would never be able to defeat black boxers routinely.\n\n\"We've got a black Rocky this year. Some people call it Creed . I call it 'black Rocky .' And that's an unbelievable statement, because Rocky takes place in a world where white athletes are as good as black athletes,\" Rock said. \" Rocky's a science fiction movie.\"\n\nRock's joke caused the entire audience to laugh. It was even considered one of the night's best jokes by the Los Angeles Times . But had Rock incorporated a negative stereotype about black people into his comedic routine, especially if Chris Rock were white, the response would have been much different. He would have been branded a racist bigot, forced to apologize, and his career would most likely be over.\n\nFurthermore, if it was ever true, this negative stereotype is being shattered by white athletes in sports all over the world - even more of a reason to find such athletic profiling offensive and racist.\n\nConsider some of the most recent dominant athletic performances. The best wide receiver in the NFL, a position long thought to be dominated by black players, is Cooper Kupp, a white man. In boxing, we must be living in the alternate world Chris Rock was referring to, because white athletes Tyson Fury and Vladimir Klitschko have dominated the heavyweight division for most of the last decade. And, in Iguodala's NBA, Nikola Jokic has been voted the league's best player the past two seasons.\n\nSimply put, white people are held to different standards when it comes to comments made about people's race. They are supposed to remain quiet and accept whatever ridicule they receive - even if the same type of ridicule would be deemed offensive if said about people of color. And then, if one protests this double standard, many on the Left dismiss their objections as white supremacy.\n\nIn their eyes, the only socially acceptable response to this racial scorn is submission. This is wrong, and it must stop. Either racial jokes are universally accepted, or they should not be made at all. But this double standard, in which making comments about other races is bigotry but acceptable when done to white people, is wrong. It is not acceptable anymore. And it should have never been acceptable in the first place. We should be striving for racial equality of all people - not just the preferred races of the Left's political agenda."

      "text": "Why was a black congresswoman not criticized for her racist comment about white men?\n\nIt was quite contentious in the House of Representatives last week. Discussions about fake eyelashes, \"bleach blonde\" hair, and (supposedly) homophobic slurs were part of the heated exchange between Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) that received much of the country's scrutiny and attention. Yet before that chaos ensued, a black Democratic congresswoman made a bigoted statement in the House that also went unchecked and uncriticized.\n\nIf Democrats didn't have double standards, they would have none at all.\n\nWhile commenting about the accusations of sexual misconduct against Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin Gruenberg, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) stated that she was \"so tired of white men failing up.\" It's the kind of racism, intolerance, and bigotry that Democrats said they want to purge from society. However, because the target of Pressley's racist and bigoted wrath was a white man, her comments were absolved from widespread criticism or the kind of outrage had a white Republican made a similar comment about a black Democrat.\n\nFeelings or sentiments regarding the accusations against Gruenberg aside, the criticisms against him should focus on his alleged actions and what he was accused of doing. Whatever Gruenberg allegedly did or did not do, his skin color had nothing to do with it. Pressley should not have even brought it up, and everyone in Congress and the media should have criticized and condemned her for her racial bigotry.\n\nBut they didn't. Why? Because racial discrimination against white men is permitted and, in many instances, actively encouraged.\n\nAs mentioned above, Pressley's comment was the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that would have led to widespread condemnations if roles, races, and political parties had been reversed. This double standard and hypocrisy keep happening in the country's political realms. More people seem concerned with attacking Greene than calling out Pressley for her racial bigotry. It must stop. Democrats who make racist remarks deserve a strong, swift condemnation. They deserve the same kind of vitriol they have when they accuse Republicans of such things.\n\nFurthermore, given her concerns about what appears to be wealthy men not being held accountable for sexual misconduct, Pressley might want to familiarize herself with the numerous stories of professional athletes and rappers who seem to escape punishment for such crimes consistently. They repeatedly \"fail upward,\" and they aren't white men. Pressley also might want to watch the video that was released this weekend of affluent rapper and music producer Sean \"Diddy\" Combs beating his girlfriend senseless in an incident from 2016.\n\nWe should all want bad people to be held accountable for their actions. This holds true if they are white or black, male or female, rich or poor. Bad people are bad people. But to Democrats like Pressley, skin color is the only factor that matters in all of this. She has routinely shown during her time in Congress that in these kinds of instances, the only things she cares about are the skin color of the victim and the skin color of the aggressor.\n\nAyanna Pressley is a racist bigot. Everyone should call her out as one. She must be held accountable for her egregious intolerance and discrimination."

      "website": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com",
      "text": "Denial of equal protection for whites: How culture countered the Constitution in America\n\nIn 1994, I represented a Colorado Springs, Colorado , businessman, a college dropout who found his niche bidding on and building guardrails on federal and state highway projects. Randy Pech developed a statewide reputation for having a sharp pencil, leaving behind well-built projects, and timely completion of subcontract awards. That is, until a day when a bid he knew was the lowest was rejected by the prime contractor, who told Pech that the federal government gave him $10,000 to award the project, not to Pech, but to a competitor based on his race. Pech believed racial preferences in federal highway contracting were unconstitutional and sued.\n\nWhen his case, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, reached the Supreme Court, the corporate media labeled him an \"angry white man\" for his demand that the Constitution's equal protection guarantee be applied to him and to the United States government. Remarkably, at the dawn of the 21st century, it did not; in fact, the solicitor general argued to the court that Congress, as a national legislature, could discriminate between and among people on the basis of race, including Pech. The court disagreed. Writing for a 5-4 majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor vacated earlier court precedents to the contrary and held that, regardless of the race or the person burdened or benefited by congressional racial discrimination, everyone had a constitutional guarantee of equal treatment.\n\nSo breathtaking was the ruling that it led the news on all three networks, made the front page (above the fold) of the nation's newspapers, and drew predictions from political pundits that \"affirmative action is dead.\" In fact, in dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that, if it remained in force, Adarand doomed all the court's past racial carveouts. Affirmative action did not die, in part because of an intervening misstep by the court (most recently corrected by the court of Chief Justice John Roberts when he wrote that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\"), but also because a case challenging congressional racial preferences has not yet reached the nine justices. Nonetheless, Adarand remains controlling in the nation's courts - for example, it was used to strike down racial preferences set forth in President Joe Biden's partisan American Rescue Plan Act.\n\nAlthough the founders' equal protection vision is embraced fully by the Supreme Court, something appears amiss in our culture in which one group and one group alone is subjected to the most un-American, uncivilized, and even unconstitutional of abuse. In a nation where, as Tucker Carlson points out, \"being racist is the ultimate sin,\" how could that have happened?\n\nFortunately, Jeremy Carl, in his crucially important new book, The Unprotected Class: How Anti-White Racism is Tearing America Apart , has answers and solutions. Carl, a graduate of Yale University and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, a top official in President Donald Trump's Interior Department, and a former research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, is now a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute out of his home in Montana, where he lives with his wife and children.\n\nFor those who dream, as did the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that their children will be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin, Carl, whose dream for his children is similar (that they \"be treated equally as they pursue their dreams\"), provides great information, insight, and inspiration. Perhaps his greatest contribution is speaking the truth: \"White Americans and 'whiteness'\" have been stigmatized \"in the service of justifying blatant racial discrimination.\" In doing so, Carl provides an exhaustive, dense, but highly readable education on how our culture, media, and, in some cases, our laws got to the sorry state in which we find ourselves. Carl backs it all up with 76 pages of nearly 1,000 endnotes with authentication, source materials, and more information.\n\nCarl painstakingly documents that anti-whiteness has manifested itself throughout America's culture. How could it not - after all, \"white supremacy\" is called the greatest threat to the country by the \"White House, Hollywood, and many major corporations.\" That is not the worst of it, however, and if you think you have been paying attention, think again. Carl provides chapter and verse on how anti-white racism has played out, including the distortion of civil rights laws; the collapse of the criminal justice system, with the concomitant excoriation of police and one-sided application of \"hate crimes;\" the destruction of white neighborhoods; the trashing of public education (CRT, nondiscipline, and affirmative action); the erasure of history; the elimination of barriers to illegal immigration, the racialization of movies, Madison Avenue, Broadway, television, music, and literature; the DEI-ing of big business and Big Tech; and finally the perversion of medicine, religion, and America's military.\n\nLed by the Democratic Party and its all-too-willing, enthusiastic, and contrary to decades of policy positions (e.g., \"school busing\") puppet President Joe Biden and the usual assortment of race hustlers, race-baiters, and demagogues, it has achieved bandwagon status as white liberals (whether out of guilt, ignorance, or ideology), colleges and universities (most of which were already leading the parade), the corporate media, and corporate America joined in decrying the alleged racism, crimes, and evils of white America. Meanwhile, this band of banal bandits drew unwitting support from a host of useful idiots, as Carl points out. After all, Vice President Dan Quayle coined the insanity, \"Diversity is our strength,\" President George W. Bush teamed with \"racial justice\" advocates to adopt the lax lending standards that led to the 2008 market crash, and the Army's chief of staff whined that the worst tragedy of the Fort Hood jihad massacre (13 dead, 42 wounded) would be if \"diversity\" became a casualty of the killings.\n\nIt matters not that, for decades, the supply of white racism has exceeded exponentially progressives' demand for it. Nor does it matter, as Carl points out, that \"white people are increasingly struggling with social dysfunctions\" that tragically yield \"deaths of despair.\" Carl argues, with authority, that they suffer from \"downward mobility, declining fertility[,] rising drug addiction[,] depression, and narrowing opportunities.\" Nonetheless, for example, lily-white environmental groups, when given a chance \"to promote a clean environment,\" will instead \"choose to slander whites every time\" to establish their anti-white bona fides.\n\nWhere is all this headed? Carl maintains that the \"common ideological purpose\" is \"to create an intellectual and cultural environment to justify the expropriation of land, property, and other wealth from whites while instituting a permanent regime of anti-white employment and legal discrimination.\"  Not all or even most participants in the movements Carl outlined share these goals, perhaps believing instead that their attacks on \"white privilege\" are merely a fight for \"justice\" - however, the movements' leaders know the end game.\n\nCarl, perhaps more than most, is sensitive to such topics after living in India, where the saying was \"you don't cast your vote, you vote your caste.\" Nonetheless, Carl has hope \"for all Americans\" and not just because a 2023 poll showed 72% of people agree it is \"okay to be white.\" (Fifty-three percent of black people agreed, and only 26% disagreed.) Carl has hope because \"Americans of all racial backgrounds understand the danger of our current situation\" and have joined in the fight for \"equal rights for Americans regardless of the color of their skin.\" Many of them have led that fight for decades, suffering abuse for doing so. Finally, Carl has hope because \"hysterical [white racism] charges are no longer deterring people from speaking out.\"\n\nCarl's closing strategies and solutions merit thoughtful consideration and implementation by leaders and ordinary people, including reforming the census, net-zero immigration that he faults today as \"unfettered\" and worsened by \"a declining focus on cultural assimilation,\" embracing lawfare against the anti-white establishment, eliminating affirmative action, reforming civil rights laws, ending DEI bureaucracies, and strengthening law enforcement. Meanwhile, Carl proposes courting Asian Americans as allies, holding black political leaders and white progressives accountable for their anti-white policies and rhetoric, speaking out against anti-white discrimination, engaging in civil disobedience, and boycotting anti-white racism.\n\nCarl's final chapter, \"Finding Our Way Home,\" foresees a home that is \"one of freedom and equality under the law,\" as envisioned by the founders, particularly James Madison. Carl notes that Madison thought that \"equal laws protecting equal rights\" ensure not only \"loyalty, and love of country,\" but also \"mutual respect and good will among citizens.\"\n\nAs America continues its journey, Carl's vision of such a homecoming is encouraging.\n\nWilliam Perry Pendley, a Wyoming attorney and a Colorado-based, public-interest lawyer for three decades with victories at the Supreme Court of the U.S., served in President Ronald Reagan's administration and led the Bureau of Land Management for former President Donald Trump."

      "text": "Am I Racist?: Fighting the culture war with a smile\n\nMatt Walsh is giving DEI's loudest voices the seriousness they deserve.\n\nA successful podcaster and Daily Wire personality, Walsh continues to pull off the act of effectively flummoxing progressive partisans into letting him into their support groups, interviews, and even dinner parties. I have to imagine there's a decreasing return on investment on Walsh running around in the equivalent of glasses and a fake mustache and successfully running the deception play, but the gas hasn't run out of the tank yet as Walsh brings audiences his latest foray into the politics of thinly veiled mockery: Am I Racist?\n\nWalsh takes viewers on a ride through the past four years of American race politics, from the ramifications of George Floyd's death to the modern state of the diversity, equity, and inclusion movement, framed as one white man's attempt to understand how his race shapes his approach to the cultural and social problems of our current moment. Perhaps unsurprisingly - given Walsh's previous cinematic offering, What Is A Woman? - hijinks ensue. At one point, when Walsh infiltrates a racial support group under a pseudonym, the revelation of his true identity leads the group actually to call the police to have the offending wrongthinker removed.\n\nAs someone who's spent the past several years dealing (willingly and unwillingly) with the onslaught of race politics, I noticed many disagreeably familiar faces in the film, from an interview with the white and fragile Robin DiAngelo to the less white but similarly fragile minds behind \"Race2Dinner,\" a sanctimonious program aimed at teaching white women about how terrible they are over formal dinner and selling them racialized salvation for $2,500 a night. (Walsh was relegated to a waiter role for the dinner scene.)\n\nThe rhetoric of diversity, equity, and inclusion's loudest proponents is on full display throughout the film. The accusations made range from Walsh being a racist (the diagnosis, of course, coming from a lily-white practitioner of antiracism) to America itself being unworthy of saving. It's nothing surprising to those who've been paying attention to the cancerous growth of DEI since late 2020, but a much-needed exposé for those who don't spend all their time paying attention to politics.\n\nIt's no new insight to note how the American racial \"equity\" movement broadly functions as a religion and one built on carefully crafted lies. If antiracism is bad religion, and it is, the people Walsh confronts in Am I Racist? aren't acting in service of politics; they're acolytes of a utopian religion that sees historical distortion, $ 2,500-a-day con jobs, and outright lies as necessary evils toward a desired goal.\n\nIn short, they're the modern version of faith healers: Just like donating to a TV preacher brings healing, participating in an antiracist training session with DiAngelo or the Race2Dinner crew brings forgiveness for one's sins of internalized prejudice. Walsh's exposing of DEI's most pedantic and radical figures functions similarly to unmasking faith healers. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and his reductio ad absurdum method is a completely viable strategy for conservatives looking to advance a better philosophy of race in America.\n\nBut it's not the only strategy we need to employ.\n\nMatt Walsh's documentaries are case studies in political mockery, and let's be clear: For conservatives seeking to architect cultural change and not just opine our way to victory, there are moments when this is good and necessary. In the case of What Is A Woman? those who are willing to deny biological differences between men and women in the face of the human costs that such denial creates have earned such mockery. In the case of Am I Racist? those who have undermined legitimate concerns about racial tensions either to cash out or advance further division and then cash out have also earned their mockery. But witty criticism is only one tool in the toolbox.\n\nAm I Racist? is a film made by the Right for the Right. It galvanizes people to take the fight to DEI advocates, but let's not forget that the fight isn't only won that way. Winning the fight takes the hard work of explaining to people who buy into DEI's premises why there's a better way out. Winning takes the hard work of explaining to marginalized people why the burdens of agency and freedom are better than the shortcuts of identity politics.\n\nThese are hard debates that won't be won merely by making satirical documentaries. But winning them is the only way to achieve the goals shared by every American who cares about greater racial equality and national unity. It's time to get in the trenches and fight the culture war. And it's a lot easier to fight if we can do that with smiles on our faces.\n\nIsaac Willour is an award-winning journalist focusing on race, culture, and American conservatism and a corporate relations analyst at Bowyer Research .

      "text": "The new PM won't be a white man, and it's not really that big a deal\n\nT he next British prime minister won't be a white man. The final runoff is between Rishi Sunak, whose resignation as chancellor of the exchequer prompted Boris Johnson's downfall, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary. Sunak's parents were born into the British diaspora of East African Indians; Truss's were left-wing teachers.\n\nOf the 11 candidates who put themselves forward for the top slot, six were not white. For context, this is in a country where white people are around 86% of the population.\n\nAnd you know what? It was no big deal. The British media were vastly more excited by the prospect of Barack Obama becoming the first black president of the United States, or of Hillary Clinton becoming the first female president, than they are by their own country getting either its first nonwhite or third female prime minister.\n\nThis partly reflects the British obsession with American identity politics, which I've lamented before in these pages. Mainly, though, it is because these are the wrong kind of women and the wrong kind of ethnic minorities. Being conservatives, they refuse to be defined by their melanin or their gametes.\n\nAs one of the candidates, Attorney General Suella Braverman, put it: \"Don't vote for me because I'm a woman. Don't vote for me because I'm brown. Vote for me because I love this country.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the contest has scrambled the sensors of some leftist pundits. They can't come to grips with the idea that the hated Tories have overtaken them in the only measure they care about. \"Can you imagine a Black or Asian person leading the Conservative Party?\" asked the woke journalist Nadine White, suggesting that \"the very concept is diametrically opposed to the party's core values.\"\n\nSome anti-Tory commentators cope with the cognitive dissonance by denying the authenticity of the candidates, circulating ugly memes that show them with white spouses, for example. Others go further. Gus John asked in the Jamaican newspaper the Gleaner: \"Why should I rejoice because 'massa' has recruited a bunch of house negroes and handed them whips to keep me in bondage and under control?\"\n\nEven relatively moderate commentators make some breathtaking assumptions. Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik savaged another Tory leadership candidate who had been brought up mainly in Nigeria for being anti-woke and for quoting Thomas Sowell. Then she condescendingly allowed, with the air of a woman making a great concession, \"This is not to imply that there is no place for people of color on the Right.\"\n\nTo see what is wrong with that sentence, try inverting it: \"This is not to imply that there is no place for white people on the Left.\" How extraordinary to assume that people should have a default setting based on skin color.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is the problem that many leftist parties have. They think in blocs, collectives, and tribes. One of the reasons minority candidates have risen further and faster in the Conservative Party than the others is that they are not confined to ethnic ghettos.\n\nThe Labour Party tends to put its West Indian candidates in seats with big West Indian electorates, its Bangladeshis with Bangladeshis, and so on. They look for community leaders, especially in local elections, who are able to deliver bloc votes, a system known among Pakistanis as \"Baradari.\" The Tories, prizing individualism, do no such thing, and most of the minority candidates contesting the leadership represented white, rural constituencies.\n\nThere are two problems with the Left's approach. First, it is incompatible with the notion of personal freedom, which is why many young people from minority communities, fed up with being expected to vote for others on essentially tribal grounds, are walking away from it.\n\nSecond, it is incompatible with pluralist democracy. There is a reason why representative government evolved largely in ethnically homogenous states - including, though it is now unfashionable to say so, 18th-century America. Multinational polities tend to produce parties that represent particular religions or language groups. Voters feel obliged to back \"their\" team, which makes politicians complacent and corrupt and turns government into a scramble for the spoils of office.\n\nThere is one part of the United Kingdom where this already happens: namely, Northern Ireland, although the system there is slightly ameliorated by the fact that there are at least two competitive parties within each community.\n\nThe question faced by every Western country, including Britain and the U.S., is whether increasing levels of immigration lead, if not to actual balkanization, at least to political tribalism. Is it possible to instill such a strong sense of shared identity that skin color becomes as irrelevant as hair color? Not, I fear, if the Left gets its way."

      "text": "Inclusive DNC Chooses White Man To Save Party - And Gun-Grabber Hogg As Vice Chair\n\nIn the wake of its general election beatdown, the party that's dedicated to smashing America's \"white heteronormative patriarchy\" has elected a lily-white, heterosexual man to its top position . Hitherto unheard-of Minnesota Democratic Party chair Ken Martin will be the new national \"chairperson,\" while skinny 24-year-old gun-grabber and general-purpose ignoramus David Hogg is among three vice chairs .\n\nIn a bold move, Democrats elect a strong black woman to be the new head of the DNC and not the whitest guy you've ever seen. pic.twitter.com/bJNofpC9Sf\n\nEvidencing a party that's still in denial, the DNC leadership race didn't center on why the party has lost control of the House, Senate and White House. Martin has, however, promised to lead a \"post-election review.\" He better get on it quickly: Only 31% of US voters view Democratic Party favorably .\n\nIn his campaign, Martin positioned himself a \"pro-labor progressive,\" however, some progressives were put off by his willingness to embrace donations from \"good billionaires.\" To hardcore progressives, that's an oxymoron . He's also rankled some progressives with his establishmentarian support of a strong US-Israel relationship -- an issue that caused major 2024 divisions in the Democratic Party and sapped leftist enthusiasm for the Harris campaign . In that context, he's been known to play an identity card of his own: Raised as a Catholic, Martin has used the fact that his mother is Jewish to try shutting down his challengers on the topic.\n\nIf Democrats were seeking to infuse a trace of genuine masculinity into the party's brand, it couldn't have chosen a worse duo than Martin and Hogg. For starters, the married-with-two-kids, mild-mannered Martin comes from the same is-that-guy-really-straight mold as Tim Walz, the Dems' exceedingly cringy 2024 veep candidate:\n\nNow, it all makes sense! Ken \"Kenergy\" Martin was Tampon Tim's life coach and advisor 😂😂😂 I couldn't imagine a more perfect fit for the new DNC chair pic.twitter.com/Lp1CkhROBC\n\nThen there's Hogg, the noodle-armed leftist and perpetual meme-target who deftly exploited his status as a student at school victimized by a mass shooter, becoming a gun control activist and snagging a Harvard University acceptance letter. On Saturday, he persuaded delegates that he's just the man to win back the many young men and women who abandoned the Democratic nuthouse in November.\n\nDavid Hogg is the Dylan Mulvaney of Greta Thunbergs. https://t.co/NzoAuEmF6B\n\nHere's Hogg last year, being nicely eviscerated on his core issue by a Chinese immigrant who escaped Communism and understands why the Constitution protects the human right of armed self-defense:\n\nDavid Hogg torched by a Chinese immigrant warning against gun control. This is what happens when liberals do an open mic. They get wrecked. They can't defend their positions. pic.twitter.com/aeUGq0ff0c\n\nAs incoming chair, Martin takes over from a black man, Jaime Harrison. Despite being the first non-woman or \"person of color\" in 14 years to lead the party, some Democrats see Martin's election as a cause for sorrow. \"Black women have always been the backbone of our party. We show up our communities, our party and our party in every election,\" former DNC staffer Marilyn Davis told Politico . \" Yet time and time again, we are overlooked when it comes to the top leadership positions in our party.\"\n\nAs for the black female candidates who were \"overlooked\" in favor of Martin, here's the unorthodox campaign speech of Dr (PhD) Quintessa Hathaway :\n\nWHAT THE!?️... During a forum for candidates running for DNC Chair, one of the candidates broke out INTO SONG. pic.twitter.com/v0tSVdKCMR\n\nApparently, that was just a warm-up...\n\nThe DNC is in shambles... SO LET'S SING!!! pic.twitter.com/TirfGCMZlD\n\nAnd here's a vice-chair also-ran demanding that delegates shut up and listen to her -- not out of courtesy, of course, but out of deference to her position on the identity-politics totem pole:\n\nI'm watching the @DNC Vice Chair candidate speeches live right now so you don't have to and I'm laughing so hard. Every other words is about race, gender and sexuality 🤣🤣 They've learned absolutely NOTHING. Every single speech is like this lmaoooo 👇 pic.twitter.com/k1yT14Da2H\n\nSpeaking of gender and sexuality, the identify-politics madness of the American left was hilariously illustrated when \"gender-balancing\" rules threw a monkey wrench in the officer elections, leaving everyone in the room baffled about how in the flying &%$# to apply them:\n\nNEW: DNC chair gets confused by his own party's rules for their \"gender balance provisions,\" has to hand over the mic to someone else who also can't explain it during leadership voting. This is absolutely insane. This party has learned nothing. pic.twitter.com/mK456Gljof\n\nThere was plenty more to laugh at -- and plenty of reasons for Republicans to think the Democrats are still drowning in Marxist identity politics, and completely detached from what most American normies want out of their government:\n\nI had a spare moment this morning, so I turned on the DNC election. This is the first thing I saw, a nerdy unmarried white woman putting on black affect and cursing - a perfect epitomization of the party. Chef's Kiss. pic.twitter.com/cedv2Ntd2Q\n\nEvery DNC Chair candidate just blamed Kamala's loss on \"racism and misogyny.\" The party's learned nothing & refuses to take any accountability for how their neoliberal corporatist policies have contributed to the very inequality they pretend to care about. pic.twitter.com/O1iRSnNGe5\n\nThis is DNC headquarters: one noticeable thing here is the lack of young fervent men in the room. And you wonder why male voters shifted away from dems last election. pic.twitter.com/I6E0uYh5jT\n\nThe party that whines endlessly about DEI just elected two white, straight (allegedly), privileged, males, Ken Martin and David Hogg, to be DNC chair and vice chair. Rules for thee but not for me? At least they don't seem to be tired of losing yet. pic.twitter.com/TDE3tkA2My\n\nDNC's Got Talent, Can Dr. Quintessa Hathaway Impress The Judges? 🎤🎵 pic.twitter.com/PZu1VdzeOO\n\nFirst Kamala, now David Hogg. I can't stop laughing 😆 pic.twitter.com/nChD35M1al\n\nIf the DNC thinks that David Hogg is the way to appeal to voters under 30, they are even more out of touch than I thought.

Jasmine Crockett burst into a loud rant during a House Oversight Committee markup session Wednesday in regards to the Dismantle DEI Act and similar legislation, asserting that \"there has been no oppression for the white man in this country.\"\n\nCrockett screeched \"You can then misuse words like oppression. There has been no oppression for the white man in this country. You tell me which white man was dragged out of their homes. You tell me which white man got dragged all the way across an ocean and told that you are gonna go and work, we are gonna steal your wives, we are gonna rape your wives. That didn't happen. That is oppression!\"\n\n\"We didn't ask to be here,\" Crockett continued to yell, adding \"We aren't the same migrants that y'all constantly come up against. We didn't run away from home. We were stolen.\"\n\nShe further proclaimed, \"So yeah, we are going to sit here and be offended when you are gonna sit here and act like, and don't let it escape you that it is white men on this side of the aisle telling us, people of color on this side of the aisle, that y'all are the ones being oppressed, that y'all are the ones being harmed.\"\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett: \"There has been no oppression for the white man in this country.\" pic.twitter.com/6Qskda7DU2\n\nThe House was in session for a hearing on HR 8706 , aka the 'Dismantle DEI Act', the purpose of which is to \"ensure equal protection of the law, to prevent racism in the Federal Government, and for other purposes.\"\n\nThe bill states that no employees should be forced to undergo \"training, education, or coursework, or other pedagogy, that asserts that a particular race, color, ethnicity, religion, biological sex, or national origin is inherently or systemically superior or inferior, oppressive or oppressed, or privileged or unprivileged.\"\n\nOh no, doing away with privilege based on ethnicity, how awful.\n\nThe bill also legislates for the Office of Personnel Management to \"terminate, close, and wind up\" the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility within 180 days.\n\nThe bill also outlines that \"No Federal funds appropriated or otherwise made available by law shall be used for the purpose of maintaining in any agency an office relating to diversity, equity, inclusion, or accessibility; or a substantially similar office.\"\n\nSo, of course those who benefit from lopsided DEI advantages are opposed to it.\n\nKeep pushing this garbage.

      "text": "Disney Exposed? VP Admits On Hidden Camera That Company Refuses To Hire 'White Males'\n\nFor almost a decade Disney has been on a Diveristy, Equity and Inclusion induced spiral into clown world (along with a number of major entertainment and media companies).  The shift by corporations towards promoting ideological propaganda instead of chasing profits started out subtle and has quickly escalated into a crescendo of absurdity.\n\nDisney has become the public focus of the wokification of media for a number of reasons including the conglomerate's massive size and global reach, but more than anything else, it used to be family favored company.  When an organization makes the virtues of family and childhood innocence its brand, any slide into degeneracy or indoctrination is going to be amplified and scrutinized.\n\nIn the past, most companies sought to remain neutral (at least in public) when it came to political affiliations and aspirations.  However, this principle has also been thrown out the window in recent years with Disney being one of the worst perpetrators of open political interference and influence; they even tried to go to war with the highly conservative state of Florida a couple years ago and that didn't work out too well for them.\n\nDisney's political allegiances are clearly to the far-left. One might even argue that without companies like Disney the woke movement wouldn't exist.  Part of this movement is the demonization of traditional western values, structures and specifically the men who built them.  That is to say, the \"white man\" is now persona non grata.\n\nEvery Marxist/Communist movement needs a great enemy, a monolithic monster to focus the ire of their followers and give them a justification for the destruction of the target society.  For the woke devout, white males are the ultimate villain that needs to be diminished and chained down for the \"safety\" of everyone else.  In other words, the anti-white male movement is an integral part of the woke movement.  The two things cannot be separated.\n\nIt has long been suspected that woke corporations have been actively discriminating against white males in the name of DEI.  Much like Affirmative Action, DEI initiatives have led companies to reject better qualified candidates for employment in favor of less qualified or completely unqualified diversity hires.  The quality of products, especially when it comes to the entertainment industry, is clearly in decline.\n\nDisney and others have consistently denied that they have an ongoing policy of white discrimination or male discrimination.  But now it appears this claim has been proven false.\n\nA Disney Senior VP, Michael Giordano, was recently caught on camera by an undercover journalist working with James O Keefe alleging that Disney actively and blatantly discriminates against white men when it comes to every area of company operations.  This includes their hiring habits for TV and film productions as well as internal company promotions.  Disney is seeking out that perfect pie chart of ethnicity, disability and sexuality to become a church of woke, sacrificing merit and success for ideological purity.\n\nTo be fair to Michael Giordano, he seems to be a victim in this situation as he notes that he is also a white male and is more likely to be passed up for promotion because of his skin color.  He mentions, sadly, that Disney also discriminates against people with mixed ethnic backgrounds if their skin is \"too white.\"  They can't just be the part genetically, they have to look the part.  The revelations he puts forward are confirmation of a DEI conspiracy that many have accused Disney of participating in.\n\nThese actions and more have inspired an army of commentators that have put Disney under a microscope, leading to increasing box office failures, dwindling streaming service numbers and a host of losing legal battles.  When Disney went woke they declared war on western culture.  It's no surprise that they are suffering defeat after defeat as western culture fights back.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Meet The Leftist Lesbian Prosecuting Daniel Penny\n\nThe latest outrage in the Daniel Penny saga, as a jury deliberates his fate, is Jordan Neely's deadbeat father suing Penny for restraining his late son, who spent his last day on earth menacing Subway riders.\n\nLooks like there is a way to get inner city deadbeat dads to care about their kids after all https://t.co/dTOiL02UeU\n\nBut something even more outrageous was brought to light recently, by the same pseudonymous X poster who brought national attention to plight of Springfield Ohio a few months ago.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran is the leftist lesbian who has been prosecuting Daniel Penny for protecting his fellow subway riders from repeat offender Jordan Neely.\n\nThis is Daniel Penny's prosecutor Dafna Yoran (Who repeatedly referred to Penny as the \"White man\" during the trial) , as profiled in Go Magazine's \"100 Women We Love.\" She brags about pioneering the \"restorative justice\" sentence for an NYC murderer. pic.twitter.com/NVeFxko2dS\n\nIt would be one thing if she were simply a tough prosecutor who threw the book at everyone, but she's not. In the video below, she brags about a particular case of \"restorative justice\": going easy on a black felony murderer who killed an elderly Asian man while robbing him.\n\nAbsolutely insane, must-watch clip of Daniel Penny's prosecutor Dafna Yoran. She talks about how she reduced a clear cut felony murder charge to (manslaughter?) because she \"felt sorry for the past trauma\" that the armed robber had endured. \"Restorative justice\" insanity. pic.twitter.com/KpJg8GHmt5\n\nWhy would Yoran go easy on a black felony murderer while throwing the book at a defendant she refers to as \"the white man\"? To ask the question is to answer it. Hopefully, she will soon face justice herself.\n\nDid she violate his civil rights? Idk, let's find out. Have the trial at the federal courthouse in Islip in Suffolk County (Eastern Long Island), which Trump won by 12 points.\n\nIn the U.S. economy, there are people like Dafna Yoran, who get paid by the government to indulge in their ideology; the rest of us have to offer useful products or services in the market economy. Here, we will do just that.\n\nAs The Market Ear reported earlier today (\"A Legend Expects A Crash In NVDA\"), a longtime Nvidia (NVDA) observer expects a crash in the stock:\n\n\"Over the past 25 years, I've witnessed five NVDA stock collapses of at least 55% and up to 90% and I've participated (via put options) in most of them. I expect a sixth relatively soon. As most know, I've been trading in and out of NVDA longer - term puts in recent months. However, prior to their latest report. I put the position back on in bigger size\" (Fred Hickey)\n\n\"Proving that human psychology never changes, here we are 24 years later and the tech industry is on another one of its overbuilding benders, even though it's clear (to me) the result will (inevitably) be a capacity glut and collapse. Instead of the limitless computing capacity needs of the Internet, this time it's the artificial intelligence (AI) story driving the capacity build out. This is a more dire situation than the great fiber-optic capacity overbuilds\"\n\n(Fred Hickey)\n\nIn the event Hickey is right, here are a couple of ways you can hedge your NVDA shares, one with optimal puts, and other with an optimal collar that effectively pays you to hedge:\n\nHedging Nvidia $NVDA\n\nWe used the Portfolio Armor iPhone app to pull up the hedges in that TikTok clip.

      "text": "The War on White Male Fiction Writers How likely is it that having produced the best literature for many centuries, in 2014 white male writers suddenly lost their ability to scrawl?\n\nC ompact magazine last week published one of the most disturbing yet culturally important articles of the decade. In The Vanishing White Male Writer , author Jacob Savage describes the cold war against male Caucasian fiction authors waged by the left-dominated publishing industry since, no surprise, the Obama years. Savage starts his piece with irrefutable proof of this outrage, citing the golden fleece for young novelists, The New York Times ' \"Notable Fiction\" list.\n\nMessage to the woke gatekeepers: White guys have universal problems ... We might have something enlightening to say about them.\n\nIn 2012, this list included seven white American men under 43, followed by six in 2013 and 2014. Then, as Savage puts it, \"The doors shut.\" There was not a single young white male millennial on the 2021 and 2022 lists, only one in 2023, and one again in 2024. In other words, only two of 72 millennials on the list were white men.\n\nSavage cites additional chilling evidence of the young white male lockout: zero in Vulture magazine's 2024 year-end fiction list, zero in Vanity Fair , zero in The Atlantic . Of the 53 millennial fiction writers featured on the Esquire year-end book list in the last five years, one was a white American male. For this group, even getting to the known authorial stage has been effectively blocked.\n\nSince 2020, no white male has been nominated for the New York Public Library's Young Lions prize for debut fiction out of 25 nominations. None for the Center for Fiction's First Novel Prize, out of 70 finalists. And none for the National Book Award, out of 14 finalists. The prestigious Wallace Stegner Fellowship at Stanford also has no white male fiction and poetry fellows, and in fact has had only one since 2020.\n\nSavage ends the data stage of his article with a brutal data bite. Not one white man born after 1984 has had a work of literary fiction published in The New Yorker , out of around 30 millennials who have. Savage provides a verdict for all this: \"The antiseptic legacy of Obama-era MFA programs hangs over this generation.\" He adds, \"The more thoughtful pieces on this subject tend to frame the issue as a crisis of literary masculinity, the inevitable consequence of an insular, female-dominated publishing world.\"\n\nSavage does a brilliant deep dive in explaining the dearth if not death of white male fiction. \"All those attacks on the 'litbro,' the mockery of male literary ambition ... have had a powerfully chilling effect. Unwilling to portray themselves as victims (cringe, politically wrong ), or as aggressors ( toxic masculinity ), unable to assume the authentic voices of others ( appropriation ), younger white men are no longer capable of describing the world around them.\"\n\nThe article gives several sad examples of young white male writers who kneel before the woke publishing overlords, such as Lee Cole ( Groundskeeping ). Cole assumes the right amount of shame at his working-class Kentucky background in his book. \"They supported Trump, chiefly because of his promise to bring back American manufacturing. Any hope I may have had for them to renounce their support was ... completely gone.\"\n\nI should like to add to Savage's insightful criticism. If white millennials have a tough time getting fiction mainstream published, older heterosexual white male scribes not named Grisham, King, Brown, Patterson, Child, or the like have it nigh impossible.\n\nI came late to the novelists club, after two prior careers as a journalist then screenwriter. I tried to get my fiction to any of the Big Five publishers but never got to the plate. The few major agents who read it liked my writing but not my white face, even with a Latin shade. Two of them told me so in more diplomatic terms. Even though my second book Paper Tigers is a Great American Novel, and my latest The Washington Trail , a shockingly prescient political detective thriller about DOJ skullduggery aimed at preventing a former President from retaking the White House. All four have done well for their boutique publishers despite their limited promotional reach.\n\nMessage to the woke gatekeepers: White guys have universal problems. They have mothers who died recently, brothers with dementia, problematic wives and girlfriends, and tempting alternatives. We might have something enlightening to say about them. We don't have to be singled out, but neither should we be shut out.\n\nWe might even create legendary new heroes to follow Odysseus, Beowulf, Robinson Crusoe, David Copperfield, the Three Musketeers, Huckleberry Finn, Mowgli, Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, Conan the Barbarian, Shane, and James Bond. Or complex successors to Captain Ahab, Rodion Raskolnikov, Captain Nemo, Jay Gatsby, Willie Stark, and Vito Corleone.\n\nWe'll never come close to the greatest writer of all time, the white man who created Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, Falstaff, Romeo and Juliet and - talk about cultural appropriation - Othello. And now he too is being cancelled by the woke mind virus: \" Shakespeare's birthplace to be decolonised after 'white supremacy fears,'\" blared a recent UK Telegraph headline .\n\nThe story relates how a trust in Stratford-upon-Avon is dishonoring its immortal native son, William Shakespeare, as a symbol of white supremacy. Shakespeare's Birthplace Trust has declared that some items in its collections may contain \" language or depictions that are racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise harmful.\" It is now \"decolonising\" its invaluable collection to \"create a more inclusive museum experience.\"\n\nI have a Shakespearean response from The Tempest to that trust, and to the anti-white male publishing bloc. \"Hell is empty and all the devils are here.\"\n\nREAD MORE from Lou Aguilar:\n\nThe Man from Planet X to the Rescue\n\nMy Mother From Another World\n\nEmail (required) *\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nExample: Yes, I would like to receive emails from The American Spectator | USA News and Politics.

      "text": "TV's Invisible White Man\n\nL ast month, the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards show garnered the lowest TV ratings in the event's history, with less than seven million viewers, a 32-percent drop from the previous year's record low of 10 million. I didn't even know the thing was on (not that I would have watched if I did), although I used to enjoy it years ago when I could still recognize a few of the nominees. Cable channel multiplication and alternate media alone cannot account for the steep drop in television interest, so clearly there are other root causes. I submit two: intersectional extremism and - the usual suspect in the death of entertainment - feminism.\n\nOnly one new network show, Prodigal Son , has a white male lead. Even granting the fact that Caucasian men dominated the small screen for close to 70 years and so moving over a bit makes sense in 2019, we still represent 36 percent of America. And while we applaud good minority-driven series like Empire (minus Jussie Smollett ), we'd still appreciate the occasional representative hero, say, a Jim Rockford, Sonny Crockett, or Captain Kirk, as would traditional female viewers. In fact, many women, including professional ones, would also enjoy a show about a stay-at-home mom or a romantic girl, but none are to be found. That's because today's Hollywood producers don't just ignore the large potential audience; they disdain it - indirectly through intersectional fare, yet quite noticeably. And wise persons avoid going to places where they're unwelcome, such as the modern TV landscape.\n\nI took a look at the new fall season's primetime network schedule to see which freshman shows a conservative like myself - one of a group that comprises half the country - might want to watch. I confined my research to dramas on the four original networks, since politically incorrect comedy is as dead as Roseanne Barr's career. I assessed, in broadcast order, the premise of each new series, the plotline of its second episode, its woke factor, and whether these elements give a positive or negative impression. Here are my findings.\n\nMonday\n\nAll Rise (CBS). Premise: Judge Lola Carmichael dishes out justice for the people of Los Angeles (\"justice\" here clearly excludes getting homeless people off the streets). Episode 2 plotline: When an immigration agent pursues a defendant in Lola's courtroom, she must fend him off. Woke factor: Crusading black female judge protagonist; anti-ICE/anti-Trump alert. Impression: Negative.\n\nProdigal Son (Fox). Premise: Criminal psychologist Malcolm Bright draws on his background as the son of a serial killer to advance his career. Episode 2 plotline: As Bright slips into the mind of a serial killer, he must deal with the repercussions of seeing his father for the first time in years. Woke factor: Irrelevant. Tired serial killer-mind hunter cliché. Impression: Negative.\n\nBluff City Law (NBC). Premise: Brilliant lawyer Sydney Strait joins her liberal lion father's Memphis law firm in the belief that it's her best chance to change the world (into Venezuela). Episode 2 teaser: Sydney eviscerates a squirming white male on the stand. \"You're twisting my words,\" he cries. \"No, sir, your words are twisted,\" she snaps back (in truly awful writing). Woke factor: SJW female lawyer protagonist. Impression: Negative.\n\nTuesday\n\nEmergence (ABC). Premise: A police chief takes in a young girl she finds near the site of a mysterious accident. Episode 2 plotline: Jo and Chris try to identify the sinister forces coming after Piper (probably a Christian cult). Woke factor: Female police chief protagonist. Impression: Negative.\n\nAlmost Family (Fox). Premise: Julia Benchley discovers two new sisters after her fertility doctor father reveals he conceived dozens of children (happens all the time). Episode 2 plotline: Julia is haunted by her new reality. Woke factor: Irrelevant. Three female protagonists is standard for a chick show. Impression: Positive for women only.\n\nStumptown (ABC). Premise: Army veteran Dex Parios works as a private investigator in Portland. Episode 2 moot. Woke factor: Female private eye protagonist. Impression: Highly negative.\n\nThursday\n\nEvil (CBS). Premise: Agnostic psychologist Kristen Bouchard joins trainee priest David Acosta in investigating the Church's backlog of unexplained mysteries. Episode 2 plotline: Kristen and David investigate a supposed miracle when a teenage girl comes back to life after being declared dead for two hours. Woke factor: Female and black male co-protagonists, possibly offset by the strong Christian element. Impression: Positive.\n\nJudging by the new TV season, I suspect next year's Emmy ceremony will get even lower ratings. Fortunately, there's Turner Classic Movies to keep me watching television. To indulge in more recent non-woke entertainment, however, I recently went to the movies to see Rambo: Last Blood , a film enjoying great box-office success ($40 million after three weeks in the top 10) despite - or perhaps because of - critical handwringing over its \"toxic\" white male hero dispatching Mexican \"bad hombres. \" Variety warned , \"Suddenly, the infamous wall along the U.S.-Mexico border seems inadequate - less in containing the cartels than in protecting them from Rambo's brand of vigilante justice.\"\n\nBut before the movie started, I sat through four trailers: 21 Bridges , starring Chadwick (Black Panther) Boseman as a disgraced NYPD detective; Black and Blue , with Naomie Harris trying to balance her identity as a black woman and her role as a police officer ; Gemini Man , with hitman Will Smith battling a younger clone of himself; and Midway , which probably would have had female fighter pilots attacking the Japanese fleet if the producers thought they could get away with it historically. I suspect next year's Oscars won't fare much better than the Emmys.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

      "text": "Men in College: Not Left Behind. Cut Loose. Contempt for men is having dire consequences.\n\nA generation of men is falling through the cracks. As reported by Douglas Belkin in the WSJ , a recent study by a nonprofit research group reveals that the college enrollment gap between men and women has reached new records. Last year, women made up about 60% of college students, and if the trend continues, it is predicted that in the next few years women earning degrees will outnumber men two to one.\n\nThe trend has been shown to be especially pronounced among white men, whose enrollment is often lower than minority men within the same income range. Lower-income white males were the demographic group least likely to enroll in college, more than 20% less likely than white women in the same income bracket.\n\nMany schools have been resorting to covert forms of incentivization just in order to prevent the disparity from becoming too extreme, but the slide continues as administrators all around the country shrug their shoulders helplessly. Who knows what might be going on? There's simply no explaining it.\n\nMeanwhile, last week at Arizona State University two white male students were harassed out of a campus building , ostensibly for having non-liberal progressive political opinions, but based on the way the video plays out, it's obvious that their true offense was existing in a certain kind of body that happens white and male. Some of the exchanges include:\n\n\"White is not a culture. You think whiteness is a culture?\"\n\n\"This white man is trying to take up our space.\"\n\n\"[This] is peak white, cis, male bullshit.\"\n\nAt one point in the video, the woman who is harassing the men refers to their actions (sitting at a table and studying) as \"violence.\" \"You're making this space uncomfortable,\" she screams without the faintest hint of self-awareness, this being yet another the same crude racial bullying that has become commonplace on American campuses.\n\nWatching the young man with the \"Police Lives Matter\" sticker attempt to apologize to the women who are laughing at him and degrading him on the basis of his race, it was so blindingly clear that the national conversation about \"privilege\" has become totally unmoored from reality. Unsurprisingly, the ASU administration has released an entirely inadequate response referring to the \"incident\" as a \"difference of opinion,\" a nice bit of lie-by-description. One can bet that there will be no serious repercussions for the students involved and that these kinds of \"incidents\" will continue unabated as they have for years now.\n\nBut could the creation of such an openly hostile environment possibly be contributing to the decline in male attendance? Might the ubiquity of an ideology that paints \"white straight cis men\" as the sin bearers of society having something to do with it? Might hearing constantly that there are \"too many white males\" in every given context or being told that \"the future is female\" play any part in this? Surely not. In this year of our Lord, drawing obvious and sensible conclusions from the evidence of our own eyes has become distinctly un-American. Instead, denial and obfuscation are the style of the day. So it was no surprise when, shortly after the WSJ article was published, all of the predictable players leapt into the action to reframe the narrative.\n\nKevin Carey, writing for the NYT, argues that the reason that colleges seem to favor women over men is because of sexism - against women. You might be confused but as Carey explains, this is because \"society requires women to spend more time and money to get a job.\"\n\n\"There are still some good-paying jobs available to men without college credentials,\" he claims (without evidence), \"There are relatively few for such women.\" But Carey won't mention that these jobs, where they still exist , are usually physically demanding, dangerous and that women, by and large, do not want them. (The list of jobs which women are actually prohibited from having is vanishingly small and consists of items like \"male stripper.\") This is also the reason why men are ten times more likely to die on the job . He also won't mention that these jobs are steadily disappearing as a result of increasing automation. But I very much doubt that this argument is being made in good faith to begin with.\n\nCarey ends his article by saying, \"Last year, women were less likely than men to leave community college...[but] about 200,000 fewer women were enrolled in community college last year nonetheless. If we're looking for a college enrollment crisis, that's also a good place to start.\"\n\nGet it? It doesn't matter that more men than women left community college last year, the attention must remain on women. It is important to understand that hacks like Kevin Carey are part of a media apparatus that exists for the sole purpose of masking leftwing failures with semi-plausible, sophistical gibberish. None of his arguments hold water, but debunking them would require a level of attention and detail that can rarely be given in articles made for the general public.\n\nJennifer Delahunty is a college enrollment consultant who has headed admissions offices at Kenyon College and Lewis & Clark College. When interviewed by Belkin she noted that the primary obstacle to improving the situation is gender politics, as if it could be anything else.\n\nIn a recent interview , Dr. Warren Farrell (author of The Boy Crisis ) recounts an experience he had speaking with 2020 Democratic nominee Andrew Yang. He was trying to gather political support to tackle some of the issues affecting men, and as Farrell tells it, Yang was very sympathetic. But later, one of his staff explained to Farrel that giving this attention to boys and men would certainly alienate feminist voters, and Yang's campaign simply could not afford to take on those issues. So boys and young men will continue to flounder, and then, when men fail in their lives, the issue will be framed as women being further victimized by a lack of \"economically attractive\" partners . This is the reality of sexual politics in this country.\n\nWhether or not they'll talk about it with journalists, large numbers of disaffected young men have taken to the web where they can vent their grievances, become radicalized, and get addicted to pornography, creating a cycle of emotional wreckage that goes on and on without end. Who benefits from this? Certainly not the normal men and women who still share the hope of settling down into loving relationships and making families.\n\nDelahunty acknowledges the danger of choosing to ignore the plight of one-half of the nation. \"If you care about our society, one, and, two, if you care about women, you have to care about the boys, too. If you have equally educated numbers of men and women that just makes a better society, and it makes it better for women.\" But even the fact that it has to be framed in this way is evidence of depressing moral collapse. How sad is it that in the age of \"empathy\" reasons must be given to care for people to care about men and boys?\n\nIn reality, men are not failing society. Our society is failing them, through a combination of prejudice, callousness, and cowardice. Will this have long-term negative consequences? Of course. Disastrous ones. And when they manifest, when it is no longer possible to gaslight the American people any longer, the parties responsible will, without missing a beat, publish a rash of articles to explain why this just proves that they were right all along.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Banal Evil of Isis Davis-Marks \"Totalitarianism appeals to the very dangerous emotional needs of people who live in complete isolation and in fear of one another.\" - Hannah Arendt\n\nM ama's don't let your babies grow up to be Yalies. They're the worst. And, as it turns out, evil. Isis Davis-Marks, a staff columnist for the Yale Daily News wrote a piece titled, \"Evil is banal.\" Indeed. Ms. Davis-Marks then proceeded to unintentionally illustrate that fact.\n\nHer first sentence is a tip-off, \"Everyone knows a white boy with shiny brown hair and a saccharine smile that conceals his great ambitions.\" The word \"saccharine\" is used multiple times throughout her piece. There is no such thing a sweet smile from a white boy.\n\nShe fleshes out her argument:\n\nWhen I'm watching the white boy - who is now a white man by this point - on CNN, I'll remember a racist remark that he said, an unintentional utterance that he made when he had one drink too many at a frat party during sophomore year. I'll recall a message that he accidentally left open on a computer when he forgot to log out of iMessage, where he likened a woman's body to a particularly large animal. I'll kick myself for forgetting to screenshot the evidence.\n\nAnd, when I'm watching him smile that smile, I'll think that I could have stopped it.\n\nShe wonders at the solution to stop this evil and comes to this conclusion:\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure what the solution is. This expands beyond vocalizing problems about sexual assault: The core of this problem has to do with our values. The problem isn't just the Yale administration; it's Yale students. We allow things to skate by. We forget. We say, \"No, he couldn't have done that,\" or, \"But he's so nice.\" No questions are asked when our friends accept job offers from companies that manufacture weapons or contribute to gentrification in cities. We merely smile at them and wave as we walk across our residential college courtyards and do nothing. Thirty years later, we kick ourselves when it's too late.\n\nBut I can't do that anymore - I can't let things slip by. I'm watching you, white boy. And this time, I'm taking the screenshot. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIt's worthwhile to note her standards here.\n\nIn other words, good people like Isis gather information against their peers and use it to ruin them, based on their race and gender, later.\n\nIsis demonstrates the banality of evil. She shows how facile it is to make blatant racist statements. She illustrates the absurdity of her own argument.\n\nWould anyone trust someone so misandrist, sexist, and racist to judge anyone or anything? And who gets to define what's offensive?\n\nThere's a reason we have the legal system we have, with a presumption of innocence and a jury of our peers. This Yale senior wants to be judge and jury against a group she despises - white men.\n\nOne could argue that being a Yale senior is privileged and that to utterly destroy someone and to have innate credibility due to the color of one's skin and gender is also privileged. But that's not how this very privileged young woman sees it. She sees the white boy/man as the \"other\". She is what she claims to hate.\n\nHeaven help us from the banal evil of people like Isis.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "CNN Goes Full Racist: 'Nothing More Frightening' than Angry White Men\n\nCNN followed up the Kyle Rittenhouse \"not guilty\" verdict by leading with an op-ed from John Blake proclaiming there is \"nothing more frightening in America today than an angry white man.\"\n\nPutting it as the lead on the front page with a photo of the acquitted Rittenhouse, the op-ed essentially lumped the 18-year-old in with men like Jacob Chansley, a.k.a the \"QAnon shaman,\" and the white supremacists who participated in the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville.\n\n(CNN.com/screenshot)\n\nThough Blake admitted the \"vast majority of White men are no menace to society,\" citing the numerous left-wing men who \"wallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year's protests over the murder of George Floyd,\" Blake asserted that the time has come to put a certain character trait on trial: \"a vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they ' can rule and brutalize without consequence. '\"\n\n\"This angry White man has been a major character throughout US history,\" Blake lamented. \"He gave the country slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\"\n\n\"It's this angry White man - not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night - who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America,\" he continued.\n\nLest people accuse him of racism, Blake admitted his statement condemning white men so broadly was a \"sweeping claim\" while maintaining that the rise of the angry white man, fueled in part by former President Trump, has led to a spike in political violence. His chief example: Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) sharing an anime cartoon in which he kills socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) with a sword. Though Blake acknowledged the 2017 attack in which a Bernie Sanders supporter attempted to assassinate Republican members of Congress, he believes that too many white conservatives fantasize about killing their opponents:\n\nTalking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal - and seemingly acceptable - in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month:\n\n\"When do we get to use the guns? ... How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?\"\n\nAdd to this toxic political atmosphere another element: Laws that not only protect White vigilante violence but, in some cases, seem to embolden vigilantes.\n\n\"That period, known as Reconstruction, was destroyed primarily by the violence of White men who used terrorist and vigilante groups like the KKK to assassinate elected officials, prevent Blacks from voting and overthrow state government,\" Blake said.\n\n\"The January 6 insurrection wasn't unprecedented. In many ways, it was a sequel,\" he added, citing an 1898 case in Wilmington, North Carolina, where white supremacists killed members of the multi-racial local government.\n\nBlake did not so much as even acknowledge how the wave of angry far-left activists (black and white) burned their way across the United States in 2020, destroying businesses, homes, and neighborhoods.\n\nBlake concluded his piece with a warning that Rittenhouse and other cases point to a frightening future.\n\n\"This is what that future looks like: More angry White men emboldened by 'stand your ground' and citizen's arrest laws, inspired by a conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment. And more dead Americans,\" he concluded.\n\nThe \"not guilty\" verdict in the Rittenhouse trial has led to scores of far-left media figures lamenting that white supremacy will go unchecked. Speaking on MSNBC, NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson even went as far as to say that the Rittenhouse acquittal was worse than the acquittal for those who killed Emmett Till.\n\n\"This was worse than the Emmett Till trial. This was worse [than] so many trials where we know, for a fact, individuals committed murder and yet they were not brought to justice,\" Johnson said. \"It is unfortunate, but this is America.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

In the piece, the author argues that \"the idea of the white man\" should be dismantled \"wherever it tries to manifest itself.\"\n\nStudent Kevin Ssonko wrote his anti-white piece in response to the backlash that had been received in response to another op-ed published in the school's student newspaper last week, entitled, \"Should White Boys Still Be Allowed to Talk?\"\n\nIn the first anti-white piece, the author had argued that white males are not qualified to share their opinions due to the color of their skin, and therefore, should be silenced.\n\nSsonko chose to double down on the claims made in the initial op-ed, stating that white men \"have yet to demonstrate any collective competence in treating people as human beings,\" and that they should listen when told to \"take a step back and shut their mouths for once in history.\"\n\nThe student also claims that the backlash garnered in response to the first piece had been similar to the backlash received in response to \"the history of liberation in the United States.\"\n\n\"If there is one thing an individual can learn from the history of this nation, it's that on the question of the liberation of human beings, white people, and white men more specifically, will not respond rationally,\" argues Ssonko.\n\n\"White men have chosen to respond to calls for equal justice as being an existential threat to their existence,\" continues the student.\n\n\"As a result of this, the conversation continues to be stifled as oppressed people are forced to continue to make the same arguments for their humanity as white men continue to refuse to understand.\"\n\nSsonko added that while Malcolm X never lived to see \"the absurdity of the neo-fascist government that we have in our current administration,\" his \"diagnosis\" of the \"racial climate\" in the United States still \"reads just as true now as it did then.\"\n\n\"So the question then must be asked,\" affirms Ssonko, \"how do we save the world from the white man?\"\n\nThe student claims that the world can be saved from \"the white man\" when society understands that \"the idea of the white man has become obsolete,\" and that it should be challenged and dismantled \"wherever it tries to manifest itself.\"\n\nDickinson College is not the only student newspaper to have published anti-white pieces recently.\n\nAn op-ed was published in Yale University's student newspaper last week, suggesting that students collect and save evidence on white male classmates, so that it can be used to ruin political careers in the future.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Joe Biden Says Racism a 'White Man's Problem,' Will Not Promise Black Running Mate\n\nJoe Biden claimed racism is institutional in America on Tuesday, but would not commit wholeheartedly to picking a person of color as his running mate if he were to win the Democrat presidential nomination.\n\nBiden, who has faced scrutiny over his ties to avowed segregationists and opposition to school busing, told a group of reporters that racism is an institutional \"white man's problem visited on people of color\" within the United States.\n\n\"White folks are the reason we have institutional racism,\" the former vice president said . \"There has always been racism in America. White supremacists have always existed, they still exist.\"\n\nBiden, who leads his fellow 2020 Democrats substantially among black voters, claimed that President Donald Trump had only furthered those divisions by using rhetoric that appeals \"to the worst damn instincts of human nature.\" Along similar lines, the former vice president has accused Trump of fanning the \"flames of white supremacy\" in recent weeks, as he attempts to portray the next election as a referendum on the nation's soul.\n\nIn order to succeed in that battle, let alone win the general election, Biden will need to do better among African American voters than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Exit polling from the race indicates that Clinton received 88 percent of the black vote. Although the figure appears high, in actuality it was significantly lower than the 93 percent former President Barack Obama garnered in his successful 2012 reelection campaign.\n\nPolitical scientists have attempted to explain the discrepancy by pointing out that overall turnout among African American voters was lower in 2016 than 2012. Few, however, have mentioned that Trump's share of the black vote was greater than Mitt Romney's in 2012, as denoted by the Roper Center for Public Opinion at Cornell University. In fact, Trump garnered the highest percentage of African American voters since 2004 .\n\nTrump's better than expected margins among black voters, coupled with strong support from the white working-class, ensured he was the first Republican presidential candidate to carry states like Michigan and Pennsylvania since 1988. In Michigan alone, Trump received 15,000 more votes in urban Wayne County-where Detroit is located-than Romney in 2012. Although Trump lost the county by a heavy margin, the increase helped him eke out a win over Clinton statewide by more than 10,000 votes.\n\nAs Biden admitted on Tuesday, the eventual Democrat nominee will need to have crossover with both black voters and the white working-class to stand a chance of ousting Trump in 2020. To ensure that he can bring together such a coalition, Biden plans to highlight his \"middle class\" bonafides on the campaign trail and actively court black cultural institutions, like churches.\n\nWhen asked if there were elements of his 40-year political career that could damage that strategy, Biden said that, although he had a \"record,\" people knew his \"character.\"\n\n\"The bad news is I have a long record. The good news is I have a long record,\" the former vice president said. \"People know me - at least they think they know me. I think after all this time, I think they have a sense of what my character is, who I am.\"\n\n\"I've never, ever, ever in my entire life been in a circumstance where I've ever felt uncomfortable being in the black community,\" Biden added.\n\nDespite touting his \"record\" and his attacks on institutional racism, Biden demurred when asked if he would commit to picking a person of color or a woman as his running mate, provided he won the Democrat nomination.\n\n\"Whomever I pick would be preferably someone who was of color and who was of a different gender, but I'm not making that commitment until I know that the person I'm dealing with I can completely, thoroughly trust, is authentic, and is on the same page,\" the former vice president said.\n\nThe question comes as some of Biden's long-held stances on racial issues are increasingly under scrutiny. Earlier this year, the 76-year-old Biden came under fire after praising the \"civility\" of two ardent segregationists with whom he served in the U.S. Senate during the early 1970s. That situation quickly spiraled when it became known that the two men in question, the late-Sens. James Eastland (D-MS) and Herman Talmadge (D-GA), were allies in Biden's crusade against busing to integrate public schools.\n\nBiden's history in that regard, coupled with his support for mass incarceration during the 1990s and his penchant for racial gaffes, have led many within the black community to call the former vice president \" woefully ignorant \" on the issues impacting African Americans.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

The feminist MP revealed that she has received many threats from the \"woke\" wing of her party over her stance against transgender people using female only spaces.\n\nIronically, the conference has so far been dominated by comments from deputy Labour Party leader and Jeremy Corbyn acolyte, Angela Rayner, who described Conservatives as bigotted \"scum\" in a meeting of leftist activists on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mirror , she said : \"I'm sick of shouting from the sidelines, and I bet youse lot are too. We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, mysoginistic, absolute pile... of banana republic... Etonian... piece of scum... and I held back a little... that I have ever seen in my life.\n\nDespite considerable backlash against the statements, Ms Rayner said that she would only apologise if Prime Minister Boris Johnson retracts the unidentified homophobic, racist, and mysoginistic comments.\n\nShe told Sky News that she was trying convey in a \"passionate way\" the \"anger and frustration that people feel when you have a prime minister, who has said things and not apologised that are racist, that are misogynistic, that are homophobic, that has given billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to their mates and literally wasted that money\".\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is struggling to keep the reigns on the far-left of his party, said that he would not have used such language and would \"talk to her later\".\n\nResponding to the outburst from Rayner, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said : \"At a time when the country is trying to pull together to recover from Covid, the last thing we need is the deputy leader of the Labour Party calling people 'scum' and yelling insults.\n\n\"We need to make politics better, not drag it into the gutter.\"\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

The systems that they use are capitalism, patriarchy, and fascism. They were created and perpetuated by white men, for white men, in the interests of white men.\"\n\nHe added that \"once we realise that we are all fighting the same fight, it just strengthens the army. A problem shared is a problem halved. Imagine if we all realised and came together and grouped together?\"\n\n\"All of these groups of people, the issues they face, it all comes from the same people: white men. So we need to get rid of them,\" he said, going on to suggest that - sotto voce - people should \"kill the rich\".\n\nThe activist also repeated a debunked claim that Apple and Google had recently removed \"Palestine\" from their map services - despite the fact that the companies never listed the \"Palestine\" label on their maps, as no such state exists - suggesting that it was a result of pressure from Israel and America.\n\n\"Palestine is not gone, as much as Israel wants to take over everything, as much as America is funding them,\" the speaker said.\n\nIn a similar Black Lives Matter protest in London earlier this month, an activist dressed in Black Panther-style attire said that it is not antisemitic to \"say free Palestine\".\n\n\"Don't let no Jewish man create a way to be unheard, to make you unheard. Silence is violence. If we keep silent, we are also a part of that oppression,\" she added.\n\nThe far-left Marxist organisation Black Lives Matter UK has also come under fire for writing on social media a \"FREE PALESTINE\" rant which attacked \"Israel's settler-colonial pursuits\" and the alleged campaign that has \"gagged of the right to critique Zionism\".\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Eva Longoria Suggests Hollywood Racist: 'White Male Can Direct' a Blockbuster Flop and 'Get Another One,' Not Me\n\nActress Eva Longoria lamented that a white man can direct a major blockbuster flop and still get another picture while women like her cannot.\n\nThe former Desperate Housewives star made her pronouncement during her Kering Women in Motion talk at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. She had been reflecting on her experience directing the movie Flamin' Hot , an American dream story about the Frito-Lay janitor who invented the popular Flamin' Hot Cheetos.\n\n\"We don't get a lot of bites at the apple,\" Longoria told Variety chief correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister. \"My movie wasn't low budget by any means - it wasn't $100 million, but it wasn't $2 million. When was the last Latina-directed studio film? It was like 20 years ago. We can't get a movie every 20 years.\"\n\n\"The problem is if this movie fails, people go, 'Oh Latino stories don't work...female directors really don't cut it.' We don't get a lot of at-bats. A white male can direct a $200 million film, fail and get another one. That's the problem. I get one at-bat, one chance, work twice as hard, twice as fast, twice as cheap,\" she added. \"You really carry the generational traumas with you into the making of the film. For me, it fueled me. I was determined.\"\n\nLongoria had been joined by USC Annenberg professor and researcher Dr. Stacy L. Smith, who praised the actress-turned-director for pushing diversity in entertainment and \"walking the walk.\"\n\n\"This was a collaborative effort to reward folks that are doing well on-screen when it comes to representation across multiple categories: gender, race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ as well as people with disabilities and over the age of 65,\" Smith said. \"Are we showing the stories that aren't told? And then who is working behind the camera?\"\n\n\"The metric in which you measure success is important,\" Longoria responded, adding that studios will make tiny gestures like adding more women behind the camera.\n\n\"They've gone from one to two. And you're like, 'Okay, technically, you did, but you still only hired two women.' So, how you measure success is really important. And inclusion being that metric is so awesome because you can applaud the people who are doing it right,\" she said.\n\nLongoria concluded with a call for Hollywood to aim for the Latino audience more.\n\n\"28% of ticket buyers at the box office are Latino,\" she said. \"Your film will not succeed if you don't have the Latino audience. Do you know how many Latinos showed up for 'Crazy Rich Asians'? Do you know how many Latinos bought a ticket for 'Fast and the Furious'? We over-index at moviegoing, so why shouldn't there be content for us if we are the ticket buyers? If we are the viewers? ... For me, I take great pride in throwing around that buying-power weight. If you don't speak to us, we may not buy that movie ticket.\"\n\n\"We're still underrepresented in front of the camera, we're still underrepresented behind the camera, we're still not tapping into the females of the Latino community,\" Longoria added. \"We were at 7% in TV and film, now we're at 5%, so the myth that Hollywood is so progressive is a myth when you look at the data.\"\n\nLongoria's lamentation about white men getting to direct a blockbuster following a flop echoes sentiments that were expressed after director Ava DuVernay's disastrous A Wrinkle in Time bombed in the box office.\n\n\"It's important to note the ludicrously unfair burden that Wrinkle was saddled with as soon as DuVernay signed on and turned protagonist Meg into a biracial girl: It had to be both artistically dazzling and a commercial hit in order for it to be considered any kind of success. Grossly put, the 'system' was rigged against it,\" wrote Inkoo Kang of The Hollywood Reporter (THR) at the time.\n\nPaul Roland Bois joined Breitbart News in 2021.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) blew up during a Wednesday House hearing on the \"Dismantle DEI Act,\" yelling that there \"has been no oppression for the white man in this country!\"\n\nThe act was introduced by Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) and Rep. Mike Cloud (R-TX) in June to \"ensure equal protection of the law\" and to \"prevent racism in the Federal Government.\"\n\nThe bill aims to end the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in government agencies like the Department of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as \"public companies subject to [the] Civil Rights Act.\"\n\nDuring a House Oversight Committee markup on the bill, Crockett became enraged at Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) for using the word \"oppression\":\n\n\"You consistently said over and over the word 'oppression,' and every time that you said it, it was almost as if I was hearing nails on a chalkboard because it seems like you don't understand the definition of 'oppression,\" Crockett said, while gesturing at Higgins.\n\n\"And I'd ask you to just refer to Google to help you out,\" she continued. \"Oppression is the prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control. That is the definition of oppression.\"\n\nIn using the Cambridge Dictionary's definition of the term - \"a situation in which people are governed in an unfair and cruel way and prevented from having opportunities and freedom\" - one could make the argument that unfairly denying someone a government job or federally funded scholarship because he is a white man could qualify as \"oppression.\"\n\nCrockett continued, \"And so, as I sit here as a black woman who practiced civil rights, let me tell you the reason that my colleagues wanted to make sure you understood the same black history that your side of the aisle wants to delete out of classrooms is because you can then misuse words like 'oppression.'\"\n\n\"There has been no oppression for the white man in this country,\" she yelled, with her finger wagging in their air.\n\n\"You tell me which white men were dragged out of their homes. You tell me which one of them got dragged all the way across an ocean and told that 'you are going to go to work. We are going to steal your wives. We are going to rape your wives,'\" the congresswoman loudly demanded.\n\n\"That didn't happen. That is oppression,\" Crockett said. \"We didn't ask to be here. We're not the same migrants that y'all constantly come up against. We didn't run away from home. We were stolen. So yeah, we are going to sit here and be offended when you want to sit here and act like... and don't let it escape you that it is white men on this side of the aisle telling us, people of color on this side of the aisle, that y'all are the ones being oppressed, that y'all are the ones that are being harmed. That's not the definition of oppression. You tell me the prolonged, cruel or unjust treatment that you've had and we can have a conversation.\"\n\nCrockett handily won her reelection bid for Texas's thirtieth congressional district after running unopposed by the Republican Party.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News, Rep. Cloud explained that the Dismantle DEI Act would rescind DEI-related executive orders in the government and close a number of DEI offices \"throughout every single agency.\"\n\n\"It prohibits federal funding for DEI activities. It ensures equal treatment,\" Cloud said, before adding that \"this is something we would love to see Trump sign.\"\n\nRELATED - Clown Show: Dem Rep.

(AP) - An 86-year-old Missouri man has died just days after pleading guilty to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl , a Black honor student who rang the white man's doorbell by mistake, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\n\nAndrew Lester of Kansas City was charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and is now a freshman at Texas A&M. Before his trial was scheduled to begin, he pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge of second-degree assault, which carries up to seven years behind bars. He was scheduled to be sentenced on March 7.\n\nCher Congour, a spokeswoman for the Clay County prosecutor's office, said Lester's attorney informed them of his death.\n\n\"We have learned of the passing of Andrew Lester and extend our sincere condolences to his family during this difficult time,\" the prosecutor's office said in a news release. \"While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr. Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case.\"\n\nThe news release offered no cause of death. Kansas City police said they weren't conducting a death investigation. And Sarah Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Clay County sheriff's office, said she had no information on Lester's cause of death since he wasn't in custody, but noted that he was in \"poor health\" at last week's plea hearing.\n\nYarl's family said in a written statement Wednesday that what happened was one of the reasons they had pushed for a speedy trial.\n\n\"Now, another Black child harmed by prejudice will never see the man who shot him face the full weight of the justice system. While Lester finally admitted guilt, it came at the very last moment-after two years of stalling. That delay leaves our family reeling,\" the statement said.\n\nThe case shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the U.S.\n\nYarl showed up on Lester's doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings.\n\nLester's attorney, Steve Salmon, had argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm.\n\nYarl testified at a hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed \"longer than normal.\" As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door, assuming he was at his brothers' friends' parents.\n\nHe said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, \"Don't come here ever again.\" Although the bullet didn't penetrate Yarl's brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later.\n\nHis family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they had filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic.\n\nSalmon said last year that Lester's physical and mental condition had deteriorated . He said Lester had heart issues, a broken hip and had been hospitalized. Lester also lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received.\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Lester was hunched over as he was wheeled into the courtroom, his hands folded. Asked whether he was in poor health, Lester responded yes.\n\nThe judge had previously ordered a mental evaluation of Lester but allowed for the trial to proceed after its completion. The results of that evaluation were not released publicly.\n\nLester's grandson, Daniel Ludwig, didn't immediately return a text message from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "'Greatest White Man That Ever Lived': Charlamagne Claims 'Trump Has Even Defied The Laws Of White Privilege'\n\nScreenshot/YouTube/Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM\n\nRadio host Charlamagne Tha God argued Friday that former President Donald Trump operates beyond what he called \"the laws of white privilege.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said during a Thursday rally that Trump would seek revenge on his \"enemies\" if he wins a second term. Charlamagne , on \" The Breakfast Club ,\" reacted to her remarks by agreeing, adding Trump would also likely focus on resolving his legal issues if reelected. (RELATED: Harris Campaign Backpedals From Economic Agenda For Black Men Days After Releasing It)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I said that so long ago. Donald Trump will be in there looking for revenge. Not only that, he's gon' be in there, you know, pardonin' his self, tryin' to get out of all his legal trouble,\" Charlamagne said before co-host Loren LoRosa cut him off to ask if Trump has the ability to pardon himself.\n\nWhen radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump on Thursday whether he would pardon himself or fire special counsel Jack Smith upon beginning his potential second term in office, the former president asserted he would immediately fire Smith.\n\n\"I'm sure he can [pardon himself],\" Charlamagne said. \"There's nothing that he can't do.\"\n\nSmith is currently prosecuting Trump on four counts of allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"The law is some magical stuff when you ain't black, ain't it?\" LoRosa asked.\n\n\"No. No. I'm telling you, Donald Trump different. Like, Donald Trump has even defied the laws of white privilege. I've never seen anything like it, ever,\" Charlamagne answered. \"Like, Donald Trump, he out white-mans the biggest white man. I'm not even joking; he's the greatest white man that ever lived. He is the Frankenstein monster of white supremacy. I never seen anything like that.\"\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan released redacted documents of Smith's evidence against Trump on Oct. 18, consisting of four heavily redacted appendix documents totaling over 1,800 pages filed in the public docket . Trump objected to publishing the materials so close to the election, but the judge argued it would be \"election interference\" not to release them.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said on Oct. 18 that he couldn't \"think of any precedent where a court has released something ... two weeks and change before our presidential election.\"\n\nChutkan also published Smith's lengthy motion on presidential immunity on Oct. 2, which described the evidence the special counsel plans to introduce at trial.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Race-Baiting Reporter Tells Major Basketball Program's Coach He's Been 'Put On The Hot Seat By The White Media'\n\nScreenshot/YouTube/UM Hoops.com\n\nA wildly unprofessional reporter told Michigan's head basketball coach Juwan Howard that he's been \"put on the hot seat by the white media\" following the Wolverines' season-ending loss to Penn State on Wednesday night.\n\n\"There's three black coaches in this conference, and throughout the season each one of you has been put on the hot seat by the white media,\" Charles Hallman of the Minnesota Spokesman said to Howard.\n\n\"I'm hoping that you survive this, because we know black coaches sometimes don't,\" Hallman added.\n\nWho is asking this question.. is this a real media person? pic.twitter.com/kOoyG738fZ\n\n- ᗩᑎT ᗯᖇIGᕼT (@itsAntWright) March 14, 2024\n\nI can't get over how grossly unprofessional, shockingly divisive, but most importantly, blatantly wrong this statement is. First of all, as a reporter, it's not Hallman's job to share his opinion on why the people he's covering are facing criticism and then make excuses for said people to their faces. If you want to do that, go start a podcast.\n\nBut more importantly, Hallman's divisive racial rhetoric completely ignores the reality of Howard's situation. He's been terrible at Michigan. Howard's Wolverines have missed the NCAA Tournament in three of his five years as skipper, including the last two seasons consecutively. This year his team has been one of the worst in the league, posting an atrocious 8-24 record. But Hallman is blaming criticisms of him on the white media...\n\nShould I, as a white man, ignore it when a black head coach is performing poorly because he's black? Isn't that incredibly demeaning? Doesn't that imply I should treat the black coaches as inherently more fragile and less able to handle criticism? I don't know Juwan Howard personally, but I'm pretty sure that's not what he would want.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "'We Were Stolen!': Dem Rep Goes On Racial Rant During Hearing, Says Black Americans Didn't 'Ask To Be Here'\n\n[Screenshot/YouTube]\n\nDemocratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett went on a racial rant against Republicans Wednesday during a House Oversight Committee hearing, stating that Black Americans didn't \"ask to be here.\"\n\nThe House Oversight Committee held a full markup hearing to consider pieces of legislation, including the Republican-led H.R. 8706 , also known as the Dismantle DEI Act. During the hearing, Crockett claimed that Republicans had misused words like \"oppression,\" stating they didn't understand what the word meant because they were white. (RELATED: Biden-Harris Health Department Spent Tens Of Millions Annually On DEI)\n\n\"It's because you can then misuse words like oppression. There has been no oppression for the white man in this country. You tell me which white men were dragged out of their homes. You tell me which one of them got dragged all the way across an ocean and told that 'You are going to go and work. We are going to steal your wives. We are going to rape your wives.' That didn't happen. That is oppression,\" Crockett said.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"We didn't ask to be here. We're not the same migrants that y'all constantly come up against. We didn't run away from home. We were stolen,\" Crockett added. \"So yeah, we are going to sit here and be offended when you want to sit here and act like and don't let it escape you that it is white men on this side of the aisle telling us people of color on this side of the aisle that y'all are the ones being oppressed. That y'all are the ones that are being harmed.\"\n\nIn June, Republican Texas Rep. Michael Cloud and Vice President-elect JD Vance introduced legislation seeking to dismantle Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) within government offices, as well as to ban \"federal contractors from mandating DEI statements or trainings,\" according to a press release. In addition to barring federal grants from funding diversity initiatives, another provision of the bill would also seek to \"prevent accreditation agencies from requiring DEI in schools and bar national securities associations, like NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange, from instituting diversity requirements for corporate boards.\"\n\nCrockett has previously used race as a talking point during committee hearings, lashing out in September at a Republican witness testifying and claiming he would be afraid to listen to a \"qualified Black woman\" like Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there \n\t\t\t\t\tare millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that \n\t\t\t\t\twe have long used to support our mission.

Rosario apparently didn't know Penny's name, so she referred to him as \"the white guy,\" and the prosecution not only didn't correct her but began referring to Penny as \"the white man\" throughout her testimony. Rosario, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who has lived in New York City for 10 years, referred to Neely by his first name or as \"Mr. Neely.\" Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Jillian Shartrand did the same throughout the exchange.\n\nMATT WALSH'S 'AM I RACIST?'

      "text": "Apple Makes It Clear: White Men Need Not Apply\n\nToday we begin with some very big news. Tickets for my new film \" Am I Racist? \" are on sale right now.\n\n\"Am I Racist?\" is the follow up to my 2022 film \"What Is A Woman?\". Two years ago we explored the insanity of gender ideology. This time we are diving deep into the world of anti-racism and DEI. It's a different topic, a different film, and a very different approach. Rather than simply ask questions, this time around I became a DEI grifter myself in order to expose the DEI grifters. It's a simple premise, really. I began this journey by asking questions, and this time around I believed whatever answer they gave me, and tried to put their ideas into action.\n\nThe film is heavily satirical, very funny, and at times very dark. And if the film is a success at the box office, it will send a profound message not just to Hollywood and the entertainment world, but to the DEI industry and all the race hustlers made this film to expose. But its success depends entirely on you. We need your support. And the best way to support our movie and the work we're doing is to go to AmIRacist.com right now and pre-order tickets.\n\nTickets for \"Am I Racist?\" are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.\n\nI know that pre-ordering movie tickets probably seems unusual to a lot of you. I've never pre-ordered a movie ticket in my life, personally. But it's extremely important in this case. Pre-sales go a long way to determining the ultimate success of the film, and they even determine how many theaters will show it in the first place. So get ready, because you're in for a wild ride with this film.\n\nNow, it's a pretty easy transition from \"Am I Racist?\" to today's lead story.\n\nAbout a year ago, Bloomberg published a report on their website that was pretty stunning, even given everything we know about rampant DEI in workplaces all over the country. Here's the headline:\n\nCorporate America Promised to Hire a Lot More People of Color.\n\nIt Actually Did.\n\nThe year after Black Lives Matter protests, the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs - 94% went to people of color.\n\nAfter that report ran, a lot of people dug a little deeper into the data. One of them was The Daily Wire's Luke Rosiak, who found that Bloomberg had made some significant math errors . For their part, Bloomberg stood by the story. It's still available on their website.\n\nWhat was lost in the discussion about the numbers is that, whether the data were precisely accurate or not, the biggest companies in this country clearly wanted to send the message that they weren't hiring white people anymore. Bloomberg admitted that the point of its article was to, \"hold companies accountable to [diversity] pledges.\" So these massive S&P companies had publicly pledged to hire fewer white people, probably coordinated with Bloomberg on the article, and then when the article came out, these corporations didn't repudiate it in any way. They didn't claim that there had been some mistake when Bloomberg reported that only 6% of their new jobs went to white people.\n\nIn retrospect, that was a pretty big tell. It was basically an admission by these corporations that white people are systematically disfavored in the application process. They're either being skipped entirely, or at the very least, corporations strongly want to create the impression that they're being skipped entirely. And indeed there have been several stories in the past year proving that this is still happening all over the place.\n\nOMG Media for example reported on this internal document at Best Buy, in which the company announced a partnership with McKinsey & Company on a Management Training Program.\n\nThe document states: \"Candidates for these programs must meet the requirements below: ... Identify as Black, Latino, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander.\"\n\nDISCRIMINATION: A Citizen Journalist has revealed Best Buy is partnering with McKinsey & Company on a Management Training Program.\n\nThe program is not open to white applicants.  \"Candidates must meet the [racial] requirements below\"\n\nAny comment @BestBuy ? pic.twitter.com/lxfivezCa6\n\n- O'Keefe Media Group (@OKeefeMedia) August 8, 2023\n\nSo unless you're one of those preferred identity groups - or at least willing to \"identify\" as one - then you don't get the extra training. Of course, if the listing had said that only white people were allowed to participate, Merrick Garland would have sent a SWAT team into Best Buy headquarters before dawn the next day. But excluding white people from professional opportunities is fine. Best Buy had no problem doing it openly.\n\nAnd when they were finally caught, they didn't immediately renounce the document. They didn't issue an apology and fire everyone involved. Instead, the CEO of the company went private on social media. Store managers called the police on James O'Keefe for standing in the mall parking lot. And eventually, Best Buy changed the job posting to remove the references to racial requirements:\n\nDELETED: As a result of our reporting, Best Buy has REMOVED a webpage featuring discriminatory language about a management training program for minorities only. @BestBuy has still not publicly commented on the fiasco pic.twitter.com/YTH52Qzz39\n\n- O'Keefe Media Group (@OKeefeMedia) August 16, 2023\n\nOf course it's not just Best Buy and Footlocker that's running anti-white programs like this. Pretty much every organization in every industry is doing it - even industries where lives are clearly at stake. Just this week, for example, a top medical fellowship announced it's going to stop excluding white applicants - not because they realized it was wrong, but because they were forced to do so.\n\nAs The Washington Examiner states:\n\nA top medical fellowship for women will stop excluding white applicants after a complaint accused the program of being racially discriminatory in light of the Supreme Court outlawing affirmative action last year. Do No Harm, a nonprofit organization that serves as a watchdog in the healthcare industry, filed a lawsuit in June on behalf of female students who met the criteria for the $20,000 award offered by the American Association of University Women but were excluded on the basis of race.\n\nSo that's progress, but it's still not clear why the fellowship is allowed to exclude men. They got rid of one part of the discrimination but kept the other, which doesn't really make sense. If we want the most qualified people in medicine - and we do - then it doesn't matter if 100% of the doctors and nurses happen to be straight white men, or gay black women, or any combination of race, gender and sexual orientation. The only thing that should matter is the quality of their work. This is not complicated. But this fellowship still requires that applicants identify as \"women,\" even though there's a zero-percent chance they can even define the word.\n\nThere are many other examples along these lines. The Daily Wire reported last year that the tech giant Oracle \"hosted scholarship and internship opportunities in conjunction with the United Negro College Fund that excluded both white and Asian applicants on the basis of their race.\" There's a whole section on \"eligibility requirements\" that limits ethnicities to \"African American/Black, American Indian - Alaska Native, Hispanic American.\" So no whites or Asians are allowed.\n\nThen there was NASCAR's listing for an internship that included this requirement: \"Be a member of one or more of the following races/ethnic minority classifications: Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Latino or Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.\" Like Best Buy, NASCAR took that listing down once people noticed it. So they at least pretended they regretted their decision to openly discriminate against whites, even though they obviously didn't. That appears to be the trend in corporate America at the moment.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' - A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nBut there's one major company that's not backing down from its overt anti-white racism. They don't care how many people notice. They are firmly in the camp of restricting opportunities for certain applicants on the basis of their skin color. I'm talking about Apple, which depending on when you check, is the biggest company on the planet. Apple has pushed various DEI initiatives over the years, which is why their operating system offers emojis of pregnant men. It's also why they recently ran an advertisement featuring an overweight black woman representing Mother Earth. But now Apple is doubling down on something called the \"Apple Entrepreneur Camp,\" which has apparently been running for a while now.\n\nHere's what the application process for the Apple Entrepreneur Camp entails, straight from the Apple website.\n\nApple Entrepreneur Camp supports underrepresented founders and developers, and encourages the pipeline and longevity of these entrepreneurs in technology. Attendees benefit from one-on-one code-level guidance, receive unprecedented access to Apple engineers and experts, and become part of the extended global network of Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni. Applications are now open for female,* Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous founders and developers.\n\nApple is taking applications for its entrepreneurship camp. No white or Asian men allowed, though.\n\nHow is this legal? Somebody should sue and make them explain why.\n\nAlso, since when did female* have an asterisk? pic.twitter.com/aDQngAUArU\n\n- Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) August 13, 2024\n\nIn other words, no white or Asian men are allowed. By virtue of their skin color, they don't get \"unprecedented access to Apple engineers and experts.\" They don't get one-on-one guidance. Because they are white or Asian, and therefore a certain level of access to Apple engineers and experts - which could obviously be vital to their careers - is closed to them. Apple is just coming right out and saying it.\n\nThis isn't remotely legal, not that Apple cares. Title 42 of the U.S. Code, section 1981, states that everyone in the United States has the right to \"make contracts\" without regard to skin color. That includes the right to enter into employment arrangements and programs like the ones Apple is offering. And no entity, whether public or private, can impair that right on the basis of skin color. Apple knows this. But no one's stopping them. No white or Asian plaintiff has sued, and the DOJ certainly doesn't care. So they're just ignoring the law.\n\nAs best I can tell, they've been running similar programs for more than a year. And now that this one is getting more attention, they still don't care. They haven't apologized. This is what they believe.\n\nActually, it's even more embarrassing than that. In the eligibility requirements, there's an asterisk by the word \"female.\" And here's what Apple says when you check into what it means.\n\nApple believes that gender expression is a fundamental right. We welcome all women to apply to this program.\n\nThis is what's known as a loophole. If you're an Asian or white man who really wants to get into this camp, there's still a pathway open to you, if you're willing to take it. You just have to tell Apple you're a woman, and they'll let you in. You have the fundamental right to demand that Apple recognize your womanhood. That's how important \"gender expression\" is to Apple. But if you don't do that, and you're white or Asian, then you won't even be allowed in the building.\n\nThe exclusion of Asian applicants is worth highlighting in particular, given that Asians have been so successful in the tech world (and in many other industries). Apple's response to their success is to exclude them. Imagine a school producing lots of NFL stars and an NFL team responds by making sure to not recruit from that school. That's basically how the corporate world handles recruiting now, except with races instead of schools.\n\nOf course white people have been particularly successful at Apple too. This is what their current senior leadership looks like:\n\nScreenshot: Apple.com/Leadership/\n\nNone of these white guys are going to resign their post to make room for more diversity. They've obtained power and success. They're not going to give it up. Instead they're going to punish white people who are just starting out in their careers. They know that, if they make some sacrifices on the altar of DEI, then the activists will leave them alone. So that's what they're doing.\n\nThe good news is that more people are willing to call this madness out. Some politicians on the Right have even noticed the problem of anti-white racism. This fact is very disturbing to the race hustlers on the left. Last night Joy Reid - chief of the modern day race hustlers - lamented the fact that Donald Trump wants to put a stop to anti-white racism:\n\nDeranged Joy Reid says Trump and Vance will \"nationalize their long-term goal of putting a stop to anti-White racism.\" pic.twitter.com/FCorckDy1M\n\n- TheBlaze (@theblaze) August 14, 2024\n\nWhat she's complaining about there, specifically, is that Trump says he would stop programs that dispense aid and relief to Americans based on race. Because if you're going to have programs to help people, everyone should have access to those programs regardless of their race. But people like Reid disagree. She quite explicitly believes that white people are and should remain a disfavored group, because she is an unapologetic anti-white bigot.\n\nBut the truth is that all it really takes is a few brave plaintiffs to step up and end all of this. There are lawyers at conservative firms all over the country that would be more than happy to take a case as cut-and-dried as the case at Apple. It really doesn't take much. But until that happens - until these corporations have to face a real financial cost for their overt discrimination - they'll keep doing it.\n\nWhat Apple is doing in particular is a clear sign that the DEI obsession has not gone anywhere. If anything it's only become more pronounced, and these corporations have become more emboldened. Recently, I covered the collapse of the fake \"consensus\" on gender procedures for children and adolescents. All that took was one journalist asking one question to the American association of plastic surgeons, and the whole \"consensus\" crumbled. And that's ultimately an encouraging development. It suggests that maybe all it takes for companies like Apple to stop their anti-white discrimination is for one job applicant - just one - to say he's had enough.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Diversity Killed His Son, But He Wishes A White Man Did It?\n\nAs Springfield suffers from cultural clashes and tragic loss, the meeting exposes the deeper issues behind the ideology of multiculturalism.\n\nOne of the many lies you'll often hear about multiculturalism is that it's an ideology of tolerance. We're a melting pot. Diversity is our strength. We're stronger together. And so on.\n\nNo one really believes any of that, least of all the proponents of multiculturalism. In reality, as Thomas Sowell has pointed out, multiculturalism is an ideology that tolerates every culture except one, which is Western culture. When it comes to Western culture, no level of hatred or self-loathing is beyond the pale. Anyone who belongs to this disfavored culture must apologize repeatedly for his own existence. He must grovel at every opportunity on account of his skin color and ethnicity. And ultimately he must turn on his own family, and sacrifice them at the altar of multiculturalism.\n\nThat's exactly what happened on Tuesday, at a city commission meeting in the town of Springfield, Ohio. In the past few days, Springfield has found itself in the center of a national political firestorm after several residents reported that animals are being sacrificed, and in some cases eaten, by the tens of thousands of Haitian nationals that have flooded into town in the past four years. And despite what ABC News says, there is clear merit to these claims. The Daily Wire is on the ground in Springfield, where we've found evidence that the heads and carcasses of slaughtered pigs are being left out in public.\n\nAs disturbing as this is, all of the talk about animals obscures a more important point, which is that human beings are being killed as well. One of them, as I mentioned earlier this week, was an 11-year-old boy named Aiden Clark. He was killed - and more than a dozen other students were seriously injured - last year by a Haitian national who crossed the center line and crashed into a school bus on the first day of school. This Haitian national was on the roads illegally. His driver's license was from Mexico.\n\nWATCH: THE MATT WALSH SHOW\n\nOn Tuesday, the father of Aiden Clark addressed the national coverage of his son's death. Here's what he said:\n\nThe parents of Aiden Clark say they wish he had been killed by an older white man, instead of a Haitian, because they say his death has been used to spread hate towards migrants. Aiden's father asks for Republicans to stop using his death for political reasons. pic.twitter.com/jzlzm5EI9q\n\n- TheBlaze (@theblaze) September 10, 2024\n\nBefore I go any further, I'll say this: Losing a child is the single worst thing that can happen to a person. It's the greatest pain a human being can experience. That's why, as a father, I almost never criticize people who have gone through something like that. I don't criticize them for how they grieve. I don't criticize them for what they say in the aftermath. It's a horror so unthinkable that there just is no way to know how a person will react.\n\nBut after these remarks, unfortunately, I feel compelled to say something because, for one thing, the man is slandering people - people like myself - who have spoken up for his son. He is attributing false motives to us. He's labeling us racists and \"hateful\" and so on. He's also claiming that no one - including politicians - has the right to even mention his son's name.\n\nNone of this is true. And we have a right to correct the record, especially since this man is now using his son's death to make a political statement. It's a false statement. It's a harmful statement. So we need to speak up because this is a matter of national importance.\n\nI'm going to repeat what the father of Aiden Clark said. \"I wish that my son, Aiden Clark, was killed by a 60-year-old white man.\" That was the line he wrote down, prepared, and then delivered. He didn't say that he wished his son was never killed, Instead, he said that he wished someone else had killed his son, so that other people wouldn't draw any unapproved conclusions.\n\nHis comments only go to show that white guilt is a sickness - an infection that has burrowed deep inside this man's mind and soul. So deep that even the death of a child did not shake him free of it. I cannot comprehend how a thought like this even enters your head. A man kills your child and your wish is that a man of a different race had killed him? How does that thought occur to you? I would expect that you'd wish that a Haitian immigrant hadn't killed your son because you wish nobody had. But to wish that someone else had killed him is incomprehensibly deranged.\n\nHis implication, if you want to be as charitable as possible, is that the tens of thousands of Haitians who have moved into Springfield are safe drivers. They're just as safe as the American citizens who have been living there for generations, supposedly. But everyone living in Springfield knows that's not true. The journalist Taylor Hansen is in Springfield. He just reported, \"Every resident I've talked to is scared of driving, and they are dealing with increased insurance rates due to unlicensed and uninsured Haitian drivers causing multiple accidents on a daily basis. There's no punishment taking place for Haitians driving without insurance, but if an American citizen does it they can have their license suspended.\"\n\nHansen also put together a compilation of some of the car crashes he's seen involving Haitians in Springfield. Here are just some of them:\n\nHere is a short compilation I put together of car accidents caused by Haitian drivers in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nEvery resident I've talked to is scared of driving, and they are dealing with increased insurance rates due to unlicensed and uninsured Haitian drivers causing multiple... pic.twitter.com/29LKnBPCpe\n\n- Tayler Hansen (@TaylerUSA) September 12, 2024\n\nSo this is what's happening in Springfield. It's all predictable. When you increase the size of a town by one-third - and all of the new arrivals are from a dysfunctional hellhole like Haiti - you're going to get a lot of bad drivers who don't obey the rules of the road. That's common sense. And some of those bad drivers are going to kill children on their way to school.\n\nIt's understandable that Aiden Clark's father is angry. But his anger is directed at the only people who have expressed any concern over his son's death. He attacks the only people who actually care that his son is dead. It seems to me that, after suffering such a tragedy, most of your anger would be reserved for the man who actually killed your son. The rest of the anger should be directed at the politicians who let that guy into the country. If he hadn't been allowed in, if your immigration system was functional, if our borders were enforced, his son would be alive. The terrible racist Right-wingers he hates so much? Guess what: if we had our way, his son would be alive. But we're the problem in his mind.\n\nAm I Racist? ONLY In Theaters Tomorrow-Get Your Tickets Now!\n\nAnd it's not just this father who thinks like this. I watched some more of this Springfield City commission meeting. The whole thing resembled a struggle session, where no one felt they could speak their minds. They all had to affirm the virtues of multiculturalism. For example, you might remember this woman who spoke a few days ago about her experiences in Springfield. This clip went viral at the time for obvious reasons. Here's some of it:\n\nSpringfield, Ohio woman says homeless Haitians are trying to camp out on her front yard, says she \"wants out of this town.\"\n\n\"I have men that cannot speak English in my front yard, screaming at me, throwing mattresses in my front yard.\"\n\n\"Look at me, I weigh 95 pounds. I couldn't... pic.twitter.com/eShzG8grC1\n\n- Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) September 9, 2024\n\nShe's understandably frustrated. She's clearly telling the truth about her firsthand experiences. And yet here was that same woman on Tuesday:\n\nSo now, after her comments generate outrage - appropriate, justified outrage - she's backtracking. Now that they make Democrats and the ideology of multiculturalism look bad, she's apologetic. She doesn't say she lied before. She just recognizes now that what she said was inconvenient for the ideology she's required to hold, if she wants to stay in the good graces of her community.\n\nAgain, the whole council meeting went like this. One speaker after another affirmed the values of \"diversity.\" Here's another:\n\nIt's like watching someone with Stockholm Syndrome. She knows the huge influx of Haitians has caused problems for Springfield. She heard all the residents saying so, just a few days ago. But then she implies that there's no use complaining about it because no one's ever going to remove all of these people. No one in power is going to send these foreign nationals back where they came from. So she might as well smile, and hold back tears, as she pretends that \"diversity\" is strengthening Springfield.\n\nThis is the essence of multiculturalism, as it's being applied in the United States. It is not an ideology of tolerance or empowerment. It's an ideology with one goal, which is the destruction of Western culture. And if this city meeting in Springfield on Tuesday is any indication, a lot of American citizens - even those who have suffered unimaginable horrors as a result of \"multiculturalism\"- are perfectly fine with that.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Affirmative Action Suit Details How Law School Blackballed Accomplished White Men, Opted For Unqualified Black Women\n\nOnly 14% of law professor job offers went to white men due to affirmative action that blocked elite scholars in favor of incompetents, lawsuit says\n\nNorthwestern Law School made faculty job offers to only three white men in the last three years, passing over intellectual giants in favor of less qualified black females, including one who graduated \"near the bottom of her class\" and another who plagiarized when writing an exam, according to a blistering lawsuit filed on Tuesday.\n\nCharging that \"[f]aculty hiring at American universities is a cesspool of corruption and lawlessness,\" the suit was filed by lawyers including Jonathan Mitchell , who was involved in the 2023 Supreme Court case on Harvard University admissions that blocked affirmative action , and signals that similar lawsuits could be in store against colleges across the country.\n\nThe lawsuit delves into the details of Northwestern's recent hiring to paint a picture of affirmative action that is not simply a tie-breaker between equals, but rather the near-total exclusion of highly qualified white males in favor of minorities with weak qualifications, and whose hiring typically ends in disaster.\n\n\"For at least the last twelve years, since the installation of then-Dean Daniel Rodriguez, the leadership of Northwestern Law School has propagated and enforced a mandate to hire as many non-white and non-male faculty candidates as possible,\" it said.\n\nThe lawsuit says it was impossible for even the brightest legal minds to reach a classroom if they were white. Northwestern declined to even interview Eugene Volokh, a \"prolific and internationally renowned legal scholar,\" for a job, the suit said - adding that Vice Dean Emily Kadens \"openly said that Professor Volokh would have been hired at Northwestern had he been anything other than a white man.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it hired Destiny Peery, a black woman who graduated from Northwestern Law \"near the bottom of her class,\" something Northwestern's faculty was well aware of, and which ordinarily would be an absolute roadblock to being hired as a law professor.\n\nBy the time Peery came up for her three-year employment review, where the school decides to get rid of or promote junior faculty, Peery had published almost nothing, but fellow black professor Janice Nadler, who was in charge of the review, misled the committee by falsely claiming old dissertation chapters were actually new work.\n\nAfter that was exposed, Nadler shifted gears to complain that because of her race, the school had given Peery so many speaking opportunities that she had no time to write. The committee voted to retain Peery, despite being \"incensed\" by Nadler's dishonesty, the suit said.\n\nAt the five-year mark, when a final decision on tenure is made, Peery had still \" failed to produce any scholarship that could warrant a tenured appointment,\" and was warned not to seek tenure. Peery then accused \"Northwestern of racism for denying her tenure, pretending that she was a victim of race and sex discrimination when racial preferences were the very reason she was hired in the first place,\" the suit said.\n\nNo other college would put her on its faculty - but Peery found employment at Harvard Law School in a non-teaching position at its \" Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice.\"\n\nSimilarly, Northwestern hired \"another unqualified black woman named Candice Player, who (like Peery) failed to obtain tenure after proving herself incapable of producing scholarship that could justify a tenured appointment. Player also struggled in the classroom, and admitted to colleagues that she did not understand the material she was teaching and couldn't handle the students' questions. In one of her classes, Player gave a final exam in which she had plagiarized an exam hypothetical from another source, because Player was too lazy to write her own exam question,\" the suit continued.\n\nThe plagiarism scandal led to her departure from Northwestern and \"Player, like Peery, failed to obtain another academic appointment after leaving Northwestern.\" She now works as Vice President of Advocacy, Public Policy and Street Outreach at Project HOME in Pennsylvania.\n\nThen- Dean Rodrigue z had \"ramrodded Player's appointment through the faculty by threatening to withhold bonuses from any professor who had the temerity to question the wisdom or legality of the appointment. Player would never even have been considered for a faculty appointment at Northwestern if she had been white or a member of a different race, and Player was hired over white male candidates who were vastly more capable and qualified than she was, \" the suit said.\n\nIn 2018, Kimberly Yuracko was appointed dean of the law school at Northwestern in a process that was secret and focused on identity politics and the exclusion of men, with the white female Yuracko beating out a black female critical race theorist, who was runner-up, it added.\n\nIn the 2019-2020 school year, Yuracko made a deal with a conservative professor that if the faculty greenlit h er problematic appointments, she would see to it that a gay professor, Ilan Wurman, was hired, even though he is white. After her candidates were approved , Wurman was blocked, with then-Associate Dean Sarah Lawsky saying \"at a faculty meeting that she opposed Wurman's appointment to the faculty because he is a white man ,\" the suit said .\n\nIn 2022, the school hired Jamelia Morgan, a black woman from the low-ranked UC Irving with only four years of teaching, and gave her a $900,000 budget to start a \"Center for Racial and Disability Justice.\" The center's website h asn't published a journal article in a year and a blog post in six months, and the suit said it has hosted only two events.\n\nIn all, in 2023-24 Northwestern Law made six offers of employment, none of which went to white men. The prior year, it made nine offers, only one of which went to a white man (whose scholarship focused on promoting affirmative action).\n\nIn 2021-2022, it made six offers, two of which went to white men- but one offer was made to someone who had \"zero chance\" of accepting because he taught at a much higher-ranked school, perhaps a maneuver to make the statistics look less anti-white. The other worked in tax law, a specialty where there were few minority options, the suit said.\n\nAccomplished white men like Volokh and Ernie Young, a longtime Duke professor and Harvard Law grad, were \" rejected in favor of candidates with mediocre and undistinguished records,\" the suit said.\n\nThe suit was filed on behalf of a group called Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences, which says it consists of people who have standing to sue because they may have lost out on faculty jobs, represented by lawyers from America First Legal and Stone Hilton in addition to Mitchell's firm .\n\nIt said that for years, administrators have thought they could \"flout\" laws preventing discrimination based on race, but \"the jig is up\" after the Supreme Court clamped down on race-based decision-making in a 2023 case on Harvard admissions.\n\nT he Northwestern suit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the law school as well as its current dean Hari Osofsky.\n\nRelated: 'Schizophrenic' Transgender Student Terrorized Top Law School, Ranted About 'Gavel Dildos' In His Law Journal\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

He also played police body camera footage of passengers talking about how they were afraid of Neely.\n\n\"Who would you want on the next train with you?\" Raiser asked jurors.\n\n\"Danny acted when others didn't,\" Raiser added, according to the New York Post . \"He put his life on the line. He did that for perfect strangers.\"\n\nCHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE\n\n\"Who would you want on the next train ride with you?\" Raiser asked again near the end of his hours-long closing statements.\n\n\"The guy on the train with the earbuds minding his own business, who you know will be there for you if something happens?\" Raiser continued. \"Or, you just hope someone like Neely never enters, especially when you're all alone.\"\n\nDuring her closing arguments, Manhattan prosecutor Dafna Yoran claimed that Penny, who is white, placed Neely, who is black, in a chokehold due to racial prejudices. Penny and witnesses have said that Neely was threatening passengers when Penny put him in the chokehold. Penny has not been charged with a hate crime.\n\n\"He didn't recognize that Jordan Neely was a person,\" Yoran told the jury, according to Fox News . \"He saw him as a person that needed to be eliminated.\"\n\nYoran also replayed footage from Penny's first police interrogation, where he was not told Neely had died . Penny refers to Neely as a \"crackhead\" in the interrogation and told detectives, \"You know these guys, they're pushing people in front of trains and stuff.\" This was a reference to the numerous people in New York City who have been pushed in front of subway trains by mentally ill individuals.\n\n\"We've all spoken dismissively about people like Jordan Neely,\" Yoran said, according to Fox. \"Maybe we, too, have lumped them all together like this, but the context is very telling here. When the defendant is talking like this about Mr. Neely, he knows he very likely had killed him. Can you imagine a reasonable person speaking like this about a human being that he or she had just killed?\"\n\nPenny didn't know he had likely killed Neely. Neely had a pulse when police arrived and took over the situation.\n\nYoran previously brought up race during her opening statement and allowed a witness to repeatedly refer to Penny as \"the white guy\" while she referred to him as \"the white man.\"\n\nThe jury will likely begin deliberations on Tuesday. Penny faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter or up to 4 years if he's convicted on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Exec Who Claimed He Was Fired For Being White Male Awarded $10 Million\n\n\"We believe the punitive damages award is a message that an employer cannot terminate and replace employees in order to achieve greater diversity in the workforce.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a marketing and communications executive who lost his job at a North Carolina-based health care system and claimed it was because he was a white male was awarded $10 million by a federal jury.\n\nIn his 2019 lawsuit, David Duvall argued that Novant Health's diversity efforts led to him being replaced in July 2018. \"The jury said that Duvall proved that his race and gender were motivating factors in Novant Health's decision to terminate him, according to the jury's verdict form. The jury also indicated that Novant Health failed to prove that it would have dismissed Duvall regardless of his race,\" the Winston-Salem Journal reported.\n\n\"Duvall said in his lawsuit that he was fired in 2018 without warning or explanation shortly before his fifth anniversary with the company. He said he was replaced by two women, one Black and one white. Duvall, who worked in Mecklenburg County, accused Novant of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits race and gender discrimination in the workplace,\" WXII 12 noted.\n\n\"His attorneys proposed that he was fired 'out of the clear blue sky' because he was a white man, and that the move was in keeping with the hospital's 'five year plan' to boost diversity by 2020. They said he wasn't the only white executive fired; in his complaint, he says the Chief Legal Officer, Medical Group President, Chief Information Officer, Patient Experience Officer and President of Haymarket Medical Center were all replaced either by a black person or a woman in the 12-18 months after him,\" the Daily Mail added.\n\nDuvall's attorney, S. Luke Largess, celebrated after the verdict, asserting, \"We are pleased that the jury agreed that Duvall's race and gender were unlawful factors in his termination - that he was fired to make room for more diverse leaders at Novant. ... Duvall was a strong advocate of diversity at Novant. We believe the punitive damages award is a message that an employer cannot terminate and replace employees in order to achieve greater diversity in the workforce.\"\n\nNovant Health had countered that Duvall's poor leadership skills led to his firing. Megan Rivers, a spokeswoman for Novant Health, responded to the verdict, saying, \"We are extremely disappointed with the verdict as we believe it is not supported by the evidence presented at trial, which includes our reason for Mr. Duvall's termination. We will pursue all legal options, including appeal, over the next several weeks and months.\"\n\nShe added as she defended the company, \"Novant Health is one of thousands of organizations to put in place robust diversity and inclusion programs, which we believe can co-exist alongside strong non-discriminatory policies that extend to all races and genders, including white men. It's important for all current and future team members to know that this verdict will not change Novant Health's steadfast commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity for all.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Leftist Group That Used Children To Attack Moderate Parents Turns On Its Adult Boss For Being White\n\nTeens Take Charge, Which Accused Opponents Of Leftist Education Policy Of Racism, Says Its Leader Inflicted 'Harm' On Children\n\nTeens Take Charge, a New York City far-left activist group that used children to hurl accusations of racism against parents who wanted to keep schools open and nearly succeeded in ending the city's tradition of rigorous merit-based magnet schools, apologized Tuesday for harming children, and said the group itself was racist.\n\nA lead player in the education culture wars of the last few years in the nation's largest school district, the group advertised itself as an organic group of largely minority children and lobbed rhetorical bombs, while leftists claimed that any rebuttals amounted to attacking children. In reality, the group was part of a nonprofit called The Bell which was run by a white man named Taylor McGraw. In its apology, TTC said it has separated from The Bell and McGraw after \"some of our community members were harmed by the white norms he perpetuated.\"\n\nIt got a new \"Interim Adult Executive Director\" named Thivaya Saraswati, \"a queer, Tamil woman,\" who wrote in the letter that she \"learned TTC wasn't the radical utopia I thought it was,\" and that \"part of our growth as an organization is to acknowledge the harm that's taken place at TTC.\"\n\n\"There was a culture at TTC that was harmful to staff and youth, especially to Black & Brown youth. This included: a deep rooted hustle, time-scarce culture that led to severe burnout; a lack of centering the most marginalized youth, which contributed to standards rooted in white supremacy and left several Black & Brown organizers feeling disposable; the deradicalization of grassroots organizing models and values during the transition to a nonprofit structure; explicitly racist remarks by a handful of youth organizers with no systems to address these harmful incidents; and white leadership perpetuating racial inequity with our organization,\" the letter said.\n\n\"The harm compounded over time, resulting in tension and a sense of disillusionment so strong, some organizers wanted us to shut it down altogether,\" it added. \"To the youth and adults who joined this organization eager to fight for change and justice but experienced harm in the process, we're deeply sorry. To the Black & Brown youth hurt by the culture at TTC, we're deeply sorry. To the Black Femme members of last year's Steering Committee, we're deeply sorry. To the TTC founders, from whose radical vision TTC strayed, we're deeply sorry.\"\n\nMcGraw did not return a request for comment from The Daily Wire on the accusations.\n\nMaud Maron, a former New York school board member and Democrat city council candidate who was attacked by TTC for disagreeing with its stance that tests are racist because too many Asians excelled, told The Daily Wire the group has much to atone for.\n\n\"They should apologize - to people whose lives they derailed and who suffered real consequences because of their viciousness,\" she said. \"They're apologizing to the wrong people about the wrong things. It was a little Maoist terror cell that went after parents like me who were simply advocating for better education for kids.\"\n\nMaron said it was bad enough that the group used children as \"human shields\" for attacks on people trying to save the school system from being dumbed down. The recent \"apology\" doesn't fix anything, she said.\n\n\"Apologizing for the fact that Taylor McGraw is a white dude is an idiotic thing to apologize for,\" Maron said. \"He ran the organization exactly according to its own logic-a bunch of kids who are supposed to attack adults who aren't sufficiently leftist... now watching them attack the guy who coordinated their vicious attacks is pretty interesting,\" she added.\n\nAsian parents were particularly shocked by TTC not only because their children stood to be harmed from an attack on educational rigor, but because those who fled Communist China saw reflections of the Red Guard in the way adult activists cultivated and used children as ideological soldiers. Parents who advocated for mainstream ideas-like the idea that it is proper to use a math test to decide who gets in to schools like Stuyvesant , one of the most rigorous math schools in the country-found themselves at the center of outlandish struggle sessions .\n\nThe group conducted activism that curiously mirrored teachers unions ' agenda, and experts said its political activities may have violated nonprofit tax law. An email obtained by the New York Post suggested that then-schools Chancellor Richard Carranza was working with groups like TTC to flood public comment sessions to drown out the voices of parents like those affiliated with PLACE (Parent Leaders for Accelerated Curriculum and Education), a group co-founded by Maron and popular with Asian parents and others who believed \"equity\" initiatives were designed to displace them and lower standards at the few remaining high-performing city schools.\n\nTTC often had children speak at contentious education meetings, relying on their youth to give their messages emotional appeal and make it harder to challenge them. But ultimately, parents in New York City did not believe in lowering standards in schools to achieve certain racial ratios, a factor in the election of Mayor Eric Adams, who has walked back policies pushed by Carranza and previous mayor Bill DeBlasio.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "America's New Civil Rights Movement\n\nIn 1950, the action of one individual in Montgomery, Alabama began a movement that would forever change the course of our nation. Rosa Parks, a 42 year older Black seamstress, refused to give up her seat to a White man and move to the back of a city bus. She was subsequently arrested and jailed. Her action, as history now denotes, was not about a seat on the bus but respect as an American citizen. The genesis was not revolution but restoration. The restoration of rights granted by the Almighty and codified within the mission statement of His nation of freedom: to be respected, valued and treated equally.\n\nThroughout the early 1900's, the Democratic Party wielded its political power throughout the South with fear and retribution. The Party's Jim Crow laws dictated every aspect of interaction between Black and White Americans with the goal to minimize any influence Black people could have within the collective community. From segregated schools, businesses, neighborhoods, restrooms, and transportation to the most mundane actions, ie: drinking from separate water fountains, these demeaning edicts were controlled by politicians with a lust for power and a disdain for empathy.\n\nA minor decision of nonviolent civil disobedience by Rosa Parks can serve as a reminder of the power single acts of courage have. Her act sparked a collective movement that challenged our nation to continue its journey to be a \"more perfect Union\". Black citizens throughout Montgomery chose to walk and car-pool instead of utilizing the convenience of riding a bus. It should be noted that this decision came with great cost; many lost their jobs, as they were viewed by their White employees as \"uppity, trouble makers\". Local organizers of the bus strike were harassed and threatened by renowned terrorist group: the Ku Klux Klan. Through these difficulties, this movement came to represent the power of the American free market system and the true essential factor in this dynamic equation: the consumer. In the end, it was committed, principled, and traditionally disenfranchised Black customers who forced a change among decades old racist policies created by powerful, local bus companies.\n\nThese citizens demanded and were eventually granted equal treatment. Due to their courage to say 'NO', one aspect of freedom endowed to us by Our Creator was restored.  The bus segregation policies in Montgomery ended within 13 months, and the remaining remnants of this evil would be uprooted in the coming years.\n\nOur nation has now reached our own modern-day Montgomery Moment. Covid 19 has allowed our nation to see firsthand the bureaucratic overreach for power. In several short months, we have watched the Biden administration strip away freedoms once taken for granted, with no concern for the constitutionality of these actions. Through the lens of fear, we have recently seen the Department of Justice weaponized as they attempted to intimidate parents and stifle their voices of advocacy for their children's education and wellbeing.\n\nThe Radical Left wing of today's Democrat Party continues their mission to systematically erode the fabric of our country through policies that bankrupt our economy, benefit the wealthy and build up bureaucracy. However, the most sweeping overreach thus far has been Biden's vaccine mandate. This unconstitutional edict essentially demands the firing of millions of Americans who do not comply. It does not allow for any exemption whether it be natural immunities, pre-existing conditions, religious exemptions or advice from a personal physician.\n\nI was blessed to have been raised in a community that taught me that at the core of freedom is individual agency - It is the God-given, self-determined liberty to make informed choices for our families and ourselves. This freedom is guaranteed to every American and should be fiercely protected. I received my vaccination earlier this year and, after consulting with my doctor, determined it was the right decision for me. This is a personal decision that every American is entitled to make that should never be surrendered to a monolithic government.\n\nDue to the Biden administration's continued disrespect for Americans' Constitutional rights, we're seeing chaos and lawlessness nationwide. Unfortunately, this has become the norm on many of our national fronts: from open borders and super inflation to Marxist indoctrination of our children and a flippant disregard for the Rule of Law on all levels of government. As we concurrently address a broken supply chain, emboldened international enemies, and racial divide not seen for decades.\n\nFortunately the most egregious of these policies, the vaccine mandate, can be addressed immediately by \"We the People\". The movement begun by Rosa Parks allowed us to see that collective single acts of courage are more powerful than those of any want-to-be dictator.\n\nAs has been its historical stand against the evils of slavery, Jim Crow and the issuance into law the passage of the 1960's Civil Rights Act, the Republican Party once again stands ready to provide a safe haven for freedom-seeking Americans. To the millions of essential citizens throughout our nation, our military, first responders, truck drivers, business owners, and all those who have chosen to say \"NO\" to the tyranny of government bureaucrats, you will find the words of LA Congressman Clay Higgins reassuring.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to all you oppressors...be prepared to defend your position. If you want a vaccine, get it! If you don't, don't! That's called freedom....On Jan 3rd 2023, Republicans will be sworn into the majority... On that day, myself and many of my colleagues will introduce legislation to reinstate my military brothers and sisters with full pay back, into your rank, so stay hard, stay strong, stay in shape. We're going to get you back in your slot.\n\n....to my business brothers and sisters, do not comply. Put your attorneys to work....you have one year to survive. You can do it...stand for freedom....\"\n\nWithin 13 months, Rosa Parks' simple act of courage began the restoration of freedom to her community. Over the next 12 months, our actions will do the same. If you want a vaccine, GET IT. If you don't, DON'T. Regardless of your decision, my friends, those of us in the Republican Party will continue to fight against the unconstitutional edicts sent forth by this Administration. This afterall is and will continue to be America: the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave.\n\nBurgess Owens is the U.S. Representative of Utah's fourth congressional district.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

The 12-year-old was tragically fatally shot by police when his toy gun, which prosecutors argued was \" functionally identical \" to a real gun, was mistaken for an authentic firearm.\n\n\"For anyone that want to know the truth,\" Rice captioned the sharp-tongued post, which is addressed to \"Shaun King.\"\n\n\"Why do you think [it's] so important to tell folks we had a conversation? Well we talked and everything that was said was very toxic and uncomfortable for me to hear that you raised additional money and then say you did not want to to (sic) bother me. Personally, I don't understand how you sleep at night.\"\n\n\"I never gave you permission to raise nothing,\" she continued. \"Along with the United States, you robbed me for the death of my son.\"\n\n\"You gave me a cop and donut conversation,\" Rice said. \"All lies Shaun, please stop thinking we on the same page. As a white man acting black you are [an] imposter that [cannot] be trusted. My son was 12 years old and, and (sic) [the Department of Justice] needs to reopen his case period. Tamir's human rights was (sic) violated, why would you ever make it about you? You are a selfish self-centered person and God will deal with you White man.\"\n\nScreenshot via Instagram\n\nSimilarly, in May, Rice took public shots at King during an interview with The Cut:\n\nShe also claimed to have never spoken to activist Shaun King despite his claims of raising money for the Rice family at their request. \"I ain't never talked to Shaun King a day in my life,\" Rice declared in the interview, which ran on The Cut. \"Shaun King raised all that money [for Tamir] and sent me a $60,000 check. I ain't know Shaun King from a hole in the wall.\"\n\nIn March, the mother likewise blasted Women's March leader and Black Lives Matter advocate Tamika Mallory.\n\n\"Look at this clout chaser,\" Rice said, referring to Mallory in a Facebook post . \"Did she lose something in this fight? I don't think so. That's the problem. They take us for a joke. That's why we never have justice cause of s*** like this.\" Cleveland.com reported:\n\nIn an interview with Cleveland.com , Rice elaborated on her social media post. She says she feels activists like Mallory, who Rice says she's never met, are \"benefitting off the blood\" of families who have lost loved ones, gaining fame in the process.\n\n\"Who hired them to represent these families?\" Rice says. \"She doesn't speak for us.

      "text": "New Hampshire Denied White Man Vaccine Due To His Skin Color, New Complaint Says\n\nA white man with 'elevated medical risk to COVID-19' was denied a vaccine in New Hampshire due to the color of his skin, says a new civil rights complaint.\n\nA white man who had \"elevated medical risk to COVID-19\" was denied a vaccine in New Hampshire due to the color of his skin, a new joint civil rights complaint from the Ethics and Public Policy Center and Boyden Gray & Associates states.\n\nThe complaint, which was sent to the Biden administration's Office of Civil Rights on Tuesday, claims that the man attempted to get a dose of the COVID-19 shot through the Public Health Council of the Upper Valley in Lebanon, New Hampshire, in April but was denied because the council was only serving \"people of color\" at that time.\n\n\"Earlier this year, New Hampshire established the use of racial and ethnic criteria to determine eligibility for COVID-19 vaccinations. Under the cover of 'equity,' the state's racial set-asides excluded vulnerable people from access to the COVID-19 vaccine because of their race, national origin, and skin color. These actions are destructive to public health and patently illegal under our bedrock civil rights laws,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe denial came as the state began to roll out its vaccine \"equity\" initiative, using millions of federal dollars obtained through the OCR parent agency the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services specifically designated for COVID-19 shots. The complaint maintains that \"using these funds in a discriminatory manner is a violation of federal law, as New Hampshire is well aware\" but that the state continued to violate civil rights laws in exchange for serving people of a certain skin color first.\n\n\"No one seeking medical care should ever be sent to the back of the line because of their race, but that is exactly what the state of New Hampshire did with COVID-19 vaccinations. HHS must investigate and hold New Hampshire accountable for its blatantly illegal discrimination,\" Rachel Morrison, an attorney and policy analyst for EPPC's HHS Accountability Project, said in a statement.\n\nNew Hampshire is not the only state that used \"equity\" as an excuse to prioritize vaccine rollout based on skin color. In Maryland, officials in certain counties chose to kick the elderly and even some essential workers off vaccination lists based on prioritization \"in the name of racial equity.\"\n\nThe same thing happened in Washington when the African American Reach and Teach Health Ministry (AARTH) began automatically deferring white people who tried to register for a COVID-19 vaccine appointment to a standby list based on race. Only after the waitlist of black and indigenous people and people of other non-white skin colors received their vaccine first would white people will be called about scheduling a time to receive their shot.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Do Democrats Have A White Man Problem?\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Van Jones this weekend, Democratic Sen. Kristen Gillibrand was asked if it was a problem that a recent poll shows three white men are leading for the 2020 presidential nomination. Her answer, which grabbed headlines, was a blunt \"Yes,\" and drew a laugh from Jones.\n\nGillibrand explained her answer a bit, but only in very broad terms. She talked about the importance of Barack Obama's first black presidency, then said, \"\"I aspire for our country to recognize the beauty of our diversity in some point in the future and I hope some day we have a woman president.\"\n\nThis answer seems to indicate that at the moment Democratic voters don't recognize the beauty of our diversity. Their top three choices - former senator Joe Biden, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, and kinda almost senator Beto O'Rourke - represent in Gillibrand's view an electorate that has not advanced to a full understanding of equality and diversity.\n\nThis take seems a bit harsh to Democratic voters, whom by the way Gillibrand may be wooing for her own run at the Oval Office. There are good reasons these three are the current leaders. Biden was vice president, Sanders came in second for the nomination last time, and O'Rourke has received the most celebratory media coverage since the Beatles came to America.\n\nThere's also the fact that the last time the Democrats nominated a white man was in 2004. Granted, all the ones before that were white men, but over the past two decades it's been a different set. Democrats elected a record number of women into office in 2018 and are handing the gavel back to the first woman to be speaker of the House. So is it really a problem that the three leaders for the nomination are white men?\n\nThere are two basic ways to address this question. The first is electoral, and the second is ideological. From the point of view of pure voting math, there are good arguments for and against a white male candidate. Proponents would say that it could help in Trump's forgotten America. Detractors would argue that today's Democratic Party must mirror the Obama coalition and pump up minority turnout.\n\nA third option exists: most voters care far less about a candidate's race and sex than most in the media and on the far left think they do, and it won't matter very much at all. In looking at all of these electoral possibilities, it doesn't seem accurate to say that fielding a white male candidate is a problem for Democrats.\n\nThat leaves the ideological problem as the one that is truly at issue here. It isn't merely symbolic. Sure, somebody not white or male polling over 10 percent would be the kind of PR win Democrats got with the photos of their wave of new female legislators. But for many Democrats, apparently including Gillibrand, equal representation on the basis of race and sex really does go beyond campaign narrative and is a driving principle of the party itself.\n\nMany Democrats feel a pressure that if they talk the talk they must walk the walk. Institutions diversify when they decide to do so intentionally, when they decide to make people's identifiers of sex, race, etc. a key component in hiring, publishing, and promoting. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Even Mitt Romney once famously asked for binders full of women because he wanted more of them serving in his administration.\n\nBut in general it is Democrats who favor more aggressive quota policies in forms like affirmative action. While conservatives at least in rhetoric focus on the importance of equal opportunity, progressives focus on equal outcomes. From this perspective, the unequal outcome of three white men sitting atop the polls must be the result of bias or discrimination in the system.\n\nIf Democrats really do think they have a problem, there are things they can do as an institution to ameliorate the situation. The party could aggressively set quota goals for elected offices. It could take race and sex into account for levels of candidate support. In all likelihood, soft forms of this kind of thing probably are happening. In some sense, the core identity of the Democratic Party today is that it is diverse and inclusive, so maybe it really is a problem for them that only white men are scoring significantly in their presidential polls.\n\nThe political calculus that the Democratic Party and progressives in general must think about is how far they want to push the agenda of decreasing white men's power. Jones' laugh and Gillibrand's reaction seemed to show that they both thought she was saying something radical, or at least something that pushes boundaries.\n\nFrankly, in the context of modern progressive thought and its influence on the Democratic Party, this was not a particularly radical thing to say. But in the context of presidential politics and the centrist smoothing of the Electoral College, it may be. There is a risk that many voters will look at conversations like the one between Gillibrand and Jones and at best roll their eyes, at worst accuse them of divisiveness, or even racism or sexism.\n\nOver the next year and a half, Democrats not only have to find the person who can beat Donald Trump, they must find the one who can do so while representing and defining the values of their party. I deeply hope that a candidate's race and sex plays an insignificant role, if any, in judging his or her fitness. But what we are hearing from Democrats lately makes me wonder if that will be the case.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Washington Post Slurs Best American Jurist Ever For 'Thinking Like A White Man'\n\nClarence Thomas's influence must not be reduced to his race because that characterization inherently contradicts everything he stands for.\n\nThe Washington Post's attempt to smear Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for thinking like a white man is a completely incorrect interpretation of the justice's legal legacy.\n\nIn an article published on Wednesday , The Washington Post, which has a history of being racist towards black conservatives , claimed that Thomas is a \"Black justice whose rulings often resemble the thinking of White conservatives.\"\n\nThis gross mischaracterization by WaPo \"reporters\" Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Marianna Sotomayor quickly earned the wrath of conservatives on Twitter prompting the corporate media to issue a \"clarification.\"\n\n\"A previous version of this story imprecisely referred to Justice Clarence Thomas's opinions as often reflecting the thinking of White conservatives, rather than conservatives broadly. That reference has been removed,\" the update at the top of the article states.\n\nSo the Washington Post just casually refers to Clarence Thomas as an Uncle Tom and it's just something that the rest of the journalists just let happen without speaking out. It's just a thing that happens and they are fine with it. https://t.co/XDg9L8dWNo\n\nIt is insulting that The Washington Post and so many others, such as President Joe Biden who significantly reduced his search for a qualified SCOTUS nominee based on racist and sexist standards , think it is acceptable to define the intelligence, honesty, or patriotism of someone, especially a Supreme Court justice, by his skin color.\n\nWaPo's attempt to insult Thomas not only exposes the corporate media outlet's hatred for what it deems to be \"white conservative\" politics but claims that anyone who earns the respect of conservatives through hard and admirable work must somehow be of the same disgusting breed.\n\nRace obsession is on the rise in U.S. politics and media thanks to Democrats' willingness to peddle it and that's why the left hates Thomas. The second black American to assume a position on the highest court in the land contradicts everything leftists preach about race and power.\n\nThomas's life is a beautiful example of the American dream and how he worked his way up with integrity and character from the streets of segregated Savannah, Ga., to the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. As a result, he is repeatedly defamed by Democrats and their media cronies.\n\nThomas is no stranger to attacks from the corporate media and the left. During his confirmation, he was assailed with false reports of sexual assault that were peddled to stop him from assuming the bench. In recent years, the media has called for Thomas's impeachment due to these decades-old allegations, which were riddled with falsehoods and inconsistencies.\n\nIn 2015, Star Trek actor and leftist activist George Takei called Thomas a \"clown in black face\" because the justice dissented in the Supreme Court's Obergefell ruling. Shortly after, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd said Thomas was a \"creepy guy who acted pervy\" in an effort to dig up those past allegations despite countless defenses of his character from his women colleagues. Just last year, Amazon censored the justice's documentary for no apparent reason other than a political one. More recently, the New Yorker tried to drudge up a controversy , which was a dud, over Thomas based on his wife's political activities.\n\nDespite the left's attempts to tear him down, Thomas remains a resilient fighter for Americans and the Constitution. He cares about protecting unborn babies , freedom of speech , and preserving the nation's essence. The left constantly assails Thomas but for what? The crime of consistently ruling in line with the philosophy and vision of the Founding Fathers who wanted \"liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nIt's fair to say that after the justice's more than 30 \"distinguished\" years on the bench, The Washington Post's interpretation of Thomas is all wrong. Thomas's thinking has shaped the way all conservatives today think, regardless of their race. He is a great thinker who is not only admired in conservative circles but has inspired them. Thomas's influence cannot and should not be reduced to his race because that characterization inherently contradicts everything he stands for.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Pregnant Emily Ratajkowski Fears Giving Birth To A White Male Unaware Of His Privilege\n\nModel, actress, and radical feminist Emily Ratajkowski announced her pregnancy in this month's Vogue Magazine, writing an essay reflecting on the sex of her child.\n\nAs is the case with many far-left causes and feminists, Ratajkowski signals her most progressive beliefs, only to find herself wrestling with the pesky reality that is biology. Like Tampax claiming men can have periods, or school districts ruling it fair for boys to compete in girls' sports, leftist causes often come down to arguments over semantics rather than science.\n\nRatajkowski finds herself in a similar trap, claiming to not really know her child's sex until he is 18, and assuring readers she wants to avoid gender stereotypes, only to admit that finding out the sex of her child in utero is \"the first real opportunity to glimpse who they might be.\"\n\nIndeed, science shows that in addition to helping parents decide what color to paint the nursery, knowing the sex of a baby in utero can help both doctors and mothers track important developments such as growth and temperament.\n\nShe moves on to lament how \"unfair\" pregnancy seems, resenting that biology does not respect the feminist ideal of perfect equality between the sexes for growing a baby. \"My husband has no physical symptoms in 'our' pregnancy, another reminder of how different a woman and man's experience of life can be,\" she writes.\n\nThis resentment of men is a central tenet for extreme feminists like Ratajkowski, who was proudly arrested at a protest over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. The belief in an oppressive patriarchy is one that fights against not just science, but all of human history. As Camille Paglia famously wrote, \"If civilization had been left in female hands, we would still be living in grass huts.\"\n\nFinally, in what may be her most vile assessment of pregnancy, Ratajkowski says should she give birth to a son, she would be distressed by his immutable, biological characteristics. \"I'm scared of having a son,\" she writes, in what seems to be an exchange of expressing contempt for her unborn child, for the cheap reward of signaling her woke beliefs on white male privilege.\n\nI've known far too many white men who move through the world unaware of their privilege, and I've been traumatized by many of my experiences with them. And boys too; it's shocking to realize how early young boys gain a sense of entitlement-to girls' bodies and to the world in general ...\n\nI'm terrified of inadvertently cultivating the carelessness and the lack of awareness that are so convenient for men. It feels much more daunting to create an understanding of privilege in a child than to teach simple black-and-white morality. How do I raise a child who learns to like themself while also teaching them about their position of power in the world?\n\nRatajkowski goes on to share the story of a friend who not only \"resented her husband more than she'd ever imagined possible,\" but broke down into tears after learning she was pregnant with a boy. She quotes her friend saying, \"It was hard to come to terms with the fact that I was bringing yet another white man into the world.\"\n\nThe radical feminist movement is no longer just about pitting women against men, but pitting a woman against her own family. It's no longer enough to just hate men, but women must also hate that they are the ones who can create men.\n\nThis movement does not empower women, but opens doors for horrific crimes to be committed against women and children. The Ratajkowskis of the world succeeded in popularizing the demand for abortion anytime, anywhere. Who's to stop them from making the next frontier normalizing sex-selective abortion?\n\nAt the conclusion of her essay, Ratajkowski once again abandons leftist semantics for the biological reality of pregnancy. What she first referred to at the start of her essay as her \"fetus\" is now called her \"child.\"\n\n\"I'm completely and undeniably helpless when it comes to almost everything surrounding my pregnancy,\" she admits, before unknowingly rebuking every feminist, pro-abortion talking point in the book, writing, \"I'm already learning from this person inside my body.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Congrats To The Media For Finally Finding A White Supremacist\n\nFewer than ten 'white supremacy' attacks doesn't exactly sound like something the FBI should be busying itself with.\n\nAssuming the gunman who shot up the Buffalo, New York, grocery store really was motivated by anti-black racism, let's do what the media do when faced with an Islamic terrorist who goes on a killing spree in America and just refer to him as a \"lone wolf,\" a mentally unstable individual who in no way reflects any broader phenomenon or trend.\n\nExcept, unlike with violent Muslim extremism, that characterization in this case would be true.\n\nDespite what the media, Democrats, leftists, and, of course, the permanent Washington bureaucracy say (over, and over, and over again), there is no imminent, large-scale threat from white nationalists. It doesn't exist outside of Joe Biden's TelePrompter.\n\nTo that claim, leftists would surely point to news reports and declarations by the U.S. Justice Department and Homeland Security. The New York Times has been all over it.\n\n\"Top law enforcement officials say the biggest domestic terror threat comes from white supremacists.\"- New York Times, June 15, 2021\n\n\"Homeland Security Dept. Affirms Threat of White Supremacy After Years of Prodding.\"-New York Times, Oct. 1, 2019\n\n\"The Grave Threats of White Supremacy and Far-Right Extremism.\"-New York Times, Feb. 22, 2019\n\nEven under Donald Trump-especially under Donald Trump-the permanent bureaucracy had been hyperventilating about \"white supremacy\" and the existential threat it supposedly represented to every American, and even democracy itself.\n\nStrangely enough, though, there isn't a ton of publicly available government data on the topic. More often than not, a government agency or official makes an assertion about white supremacists on a rampage and we're just supposed to take it as fact without hearing any specifics.\n\nFor a threat so pervasive, prolific, and prominent, wouldn't you expect there to be a nearly unlimited body of work readily available for the public to consume and understand just how grave it is?\n\nIt's not there. You're supposed to believe it anyway.\n\nSorry, government, but would you mind showing me your work on this thing you're telling me is imminently deadly?\n\nShut your racist mouth!\n\nIn the final months of Trump's term, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf released a report titled \"Homeland Threat Assessment.\" In that report, Wolf said he was \"particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent, targeted attacks in recent years.\"\n\nThe report said that domestic violent extremists, \"specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)\" were and would continue to be \"the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland.\" It made all kinds of claims about \"WSEs\": that they have \"demonstrated longstanding intent to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians, and those they believe promote multi-culturalism and globalization\"; and \"have conducted more lethal attacks in the United States than any other DVE (domestic violent extremist) movement\"; and \"have engaged in outreach and networking opportunities abroad.\"\n\nThere was even a tally alleging that nearly 40 people had been killed in attacks perpetrated by \"WSEs\" from 2018 and 2019. \"WSEs conducted half of all lethal attacks (8 of 16), resulting in the majority of deaths (39 of 48),\" the report said.\n\nBut there was a problem with the report. There were precisely zero citations showing where the Department of Homeland Security had derived its conclusions-no news articles or academic papers. Just an assurance by the acting secretary, who was \"particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists\" of late.\n\nHmm - might there be information elsewhere? A document published the previous year by the same department said the agency looked at the years from 2000 to mid-2016 and counted \"28 attacks in the United States committed by WSEs, which collectively resulted in 51 fatalities.\"\n\nThat factoid came with a citation, so that's good. But this was the corresponding footnote: \"Based on a review of US Government information, law enforcement reporting, and open source.\" There was no link to specific incidents or verifiable data. There was no cross reference. That wouldn't fly in a high school English paper, but the feds apparently think they're above having to back up their wild claims with any actual evidence.\n\nThere's more publicly available information about the government spending millions of dollars to investigate the prevalence of obesity in lesbians than there is about an allegedly serious and fatal threat we're facing from white supremacists.\n\nWhat about at the state level? In 2019, Democrat New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy's administration published a report on individual episodes of \"domestic terrorism\" that purportedly took place across the nation throughout the previous year. To the department's credit, it was highly transparent about what it was counting as an incident of \"terrorism,\" including names, dates, and locations of the perpetrators.\n\nThere were, the report said, a total of 32 \"domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda.\" Of that 32, the office said the overwhelming majority, 25, were carried out by white supremacists.\n\nThe report listed each individual incident of white supremacist-linked terrorism, with the name of the perpetrator, his age, and the location of the incident, but without references to where it drew the data. Additional information requires looking up each episode on your own.\n\nOne of the incidents involved Benjamin Morro, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who accidentally killed himself by mishandling explosives in his apartment. No motive has ever been established as to why Morro had the combustible items but law enforcement claimed to have found \"white supremacist material,\" i.e., literature in pamphlets or books, in his home.\n\nIs a dummy who accidentally blows himself up what comes to mind when you hear the phrase \"white supremacist terrorist attack\"?\n\nAnother one involved Ronnie Wilson, a 32-year-old Tennessee man who was charged with shooting a cop during a traffic stop. Wilson was allegedly a member of the white supremacist gang Aryan Nations, but the officer he shot was also white.\n\nWhen a white man shoots another white man, is that what comes to mind when you hear the phrase \"white supremacist terrorist attack\"?\n\nOne other incident involved a homeless man who was yelling racial epithets in public. (To which I ask, has anyone seen or heard from Chris Matthews lately?)\n\nYet another pertained to a black man who was burned alive by his white housemate. The two of them lived at Frazier Young Supportive Living, a residence in Tennessee for the mentally impaired.\n\nA homeless man and a literal mental patient. Is that what comes to mind when you hear the phrase \"white supremacist terrorist attacks\"?\n\nIf those four incidents don't fill you with fear that white supremacists lurk in the shadows to commit random acts of violence, I don't know what to tell you. You should be deathly afraid!\n\nTo be sure, not all of the entries in the New Jersey government's report are a reach. A few appear to be legitimate, racially motivated attacks on ethnic minorities.\n\nOne involved Natasha Bowers, a 33-year-old woman who, along with five other skinheads, beat up a black man in the back of a bar in Pennsylvania. But the odd thing about that solitary episode is that it was counted by the report as six separate attacks, one for each of the attackers charged by police.\n\nThe authors of the report did the same thing with the assault of a black man at a bar in Washington state. Eight attackers identified by law enforcement were believed to be affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood. Each suspect was listed in the report as an individual \"white supremacist attack,\" even though there was only one incident.\n\nThis would be like saying we had 19 separate September 11s because that's the number of hijackers who participated. No, we had just the one carried out by multiple people. That more than one attacker was involved doesn't mean we count each one as an individual event.\n\nTo recap: of the 25 attacks labeled in the New Jersey government's report as white supremacy, 14 were related to only two separate incidents. One of them involved a man who accidentally killed himself, another was perpetrated by a homeless guy, and yet another was committed by a mental patient in a home for the intellectually disabled. That brings the total attacks in 2018 down to more like eight-across our entire nation of 330 million people.\n\nFewer than ten \"white supremacy\" attacks doesn't exactly sound like something the FBI should be busying itself with. The numbers on \"white supremacy\" couldn't have been more padded if they were on their period.\n\nYet the president is scheduled to visit Buffalo this week, where he will most certainly talk up white supremacy as an all-consuming force that can only be beaten back by voting for more Democrats. It's a lie.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Historical Record Shows America Was Founded Against Racism, Not To Promote It\n\nThe following essay is part of The Federalist's 1620 Project , a symposium exploring the connections and contributions of the early Pilgrim and Puritan settlers in New England to the uniquely American synthesis of faith, family, freedom, and self-government.\n\nIn recent years, some prominent voices on the left have contended that America is and has been from its inception a nation established on racism and racial subjugation. This judgment implicitly informs The New York Times's 1619 Project . According to its introductory blurb, the project \"aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery ... at the very center of our national narrative.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is more direct : \"America was founded on white supremacy.\" What are we to make of such a disturbing claim?\n\nBefore examining its intrinsic merits, we might begin by noting - and rejecting - the improper use that is sometimes made of this interpretation of our country's character. The assertion that America is a fundamentally racist nation has been deployed to discredit our traditional political institutions, including and especially the Constitution.\n\nMore than one article has been written holding that the Electoral College was devised to protect the political interests of the slave states. The same claim has been made more generally about America's system of federalism. Federalism means \"states' rights,\" and everybody knows that the southern defenders of slavery held that their right to self-government at the state level permitted them to enslave African Americans. Later on, after slavery had been abolished, southerners used \"states' rights\" to defend their systems of racial segregation and denial of voting rights for black Americans.\n\nSuch arguments are both exaggerated and, of course, fallacious. Aside from a few provisions (such as the Fugitive Slave Clause) that were admittedly included to protect slavery, most of the Constitution's structures and principles were not designed exclusively by or for slaveholders. They were intended instead to both empower the federal government to tend to the nation's needs and prevent the abuse of that power. They should be judged today by how well they accomplish those (utterly non-controversial) purposes.\n\nFrom the fact that federalism once sheltered slavery, it does not follow that state-level self-government today is unworthy of the Constitution's protection. To take an even more obvious example, the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech are not bad or tainted just because some southerners once used that freedom to defend slavery or segregation.\n\nIt is also worth noting that today's left, in claiming that America is founded on racism, aligns itself with some historical characters it might wish to avoid. Racial politics makes for strange bedfellows. This point was made many times by the late Harry Jaffa in response to an earlier generation of critics of America, and it is no less relevant now.\n\nIt was, after all, Stephen Douglas - a proponent of the right of territorial governments to establish slavery or not as they saw fit - who argued that \"this government was made on the white basis, by white men, for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever.\"\n\nIt was Abraham Lincoln - the Great Emancipator - who contended in response that America was founded on the Declaration of Independence's claim that \"all men are created equal.\"\n\nIt was Chief Justice Roger Taney - writing in Dred Scott , holding that black Americans could never be citizens - who contended that at the time of the Founding:\n\n[Black Americans had] for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefit.\n\nDissenting from Taney's view, Justice John McLean noted:\n\nI prefer the lights of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay as a means of construing the Constitution in all its bearings, rather than to look behind that period, into a traffic which is now declared to be piracy, and punished with death by Christian nations.\n\nLincoln and Frederick Douglass likewise rejected Taney's account as both a misinterpretation of and a slander on the nation's Founding. Similarly, in the twentieth century Martin Luther King, Jr., presented the struggle for civil rights as a call to live up to the nation's original principles, not as a call to reject and replace them.\n\nThe point here is not to taunt the left with this embarrassing pedigree of ideas. It is rather to ask which interpretation of America's fundamental character has proven more constructive. It seems obvious, from even a cursory glance at our nation's history, that most of the work of making America better has been carried out by people like Lincoln, Douglass, and King, who believed it was fundamentally good to begin with.\n\nAs important as these considerations are, they cannot excuse us from the duty of confronting more directly the claim that America was founded on white supremacy, that it was fundamentally characterized by racism from its earliest origins. But is this claim defensible?\n\nCertainly, slavery existed in America from the time of its earliest colonial settlements. That fact alone, however, cannot settle the question. After all, a country with racism in its midst is very different from a country dedicated to racism.\n\nThe question is often difficult to address because we are apt to be misled, either by indignation or by protective love. Outraged by the injustices that were committed against generations of African Americans, we might be inclined to condemn the country that committed or permitted those injustices as fundamentally bad.\n\nThis is a common enough temptation in our judgments about individuals. Thus a man who has committed theft can be dismissed as nothing but \"a thief,\" when he is more than only that. On the other hand, a spirit of patriotic affection for our country might lead us to overlook some real defects or minimize their scope.\n\nJust as an affectionate son would not want to admit that his father is a thief, no warm-hearted patriot would want to admit that his nation was founded on racism. How can our minds escape the distorting influence of these natural human passions?\n\nWe might try to avoid this problem by taking as our guide an intelligent, sympathetic, and honest outsider. Since it is so hard to judge our own country impartially, we might learn from the judgments of a candid and foreign friend, one who is willing to acknowledge and explain what is good and bad about America. We find such a guide in Alexis de Tocqueville, whose great work, \"Democracy in America,\" frankly, and honestly, confronts our nation's experience with slavery, but without holding that it should be understood to define the nation's core character.\n\nTocqueville famously notes the decisive importance of a nation's \"point of departure\" for its subsequent development. If you want to really know a man, you have to know his childhood. \"Only then will you understand the origin of the prejudices, habits, and passions which are to dominate his life.\" So it is, Tocqueville adds, with nations. \"Peoples always bear some marks of their origins. Circumstances of birth and growth affect all the rest of their careers.\"\n\nIf we can examine a nation's birth and infancy, there we will find the origins of its \"prejudices, habits, dominating passions, and all that comes to be called the national character.\" Here Tocqueville might seem to offer decisive support for the contemporary left's criticism of America. But unlike many contemporary voices, Tocqueville does not view slavery and racism as fundamentally shaping the nation's dominant character.\n\nIn the first place, he points out that slavery primarily influenced only a particular, localized part of America. Virginia \"had hardly been established when slavery was introduced,\" and this institution ended up exerting \"an immense influence on the character, laws, and future of the whole South.\" For Tocqueville, slavery shaped the South but not the whole country's way of life.\n\nIn the second place, Tocqueville presents the origins of slavery in America less as a deliberate choice of the New World settlements and more as a tragic accident the consequences of which gradually grew to immense proportions. Here is how Tocqueville suggests American slavery should be understood:\n\n[An] evil which has percolated furtively into the world. ... It began with an individual whose name history does not record; it was cast like an accursed seed somewhere on the ground; it then nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spread with the society that accepted it.\n\nTocqueville clearly regards the original southern settlers as less moral and less enlightened than their northern counterparts. The northerners came to America primarily to found self-governing communities based upon their (lofty and demanding) religious vision of a righteous society. The original Virginians came primarily in the pursuit of gain. Nevertheless, as Tocqueville reminds us, it would be unjust to the original southern settlers to say that they came to America with a premeditated purpose to establish slavery.\n\nIn Tocqueville's view, America's original national character was not characterized by the local introduction of slavery by certain settlers, but instead by the long-established culture and deliberate aims of the Anglo-American colonists as a whole. They were, to begin with, liberty-loving Englishmen. They came from a country that had long been agitated by party conflict, and therefore in which \"each faction, in turn, had been forced to put itself under the protection of the laws.\" Thus, they had learned the value of the rule of law, and had acquired \"more acquaintance with notions of rights and principles of true liberty than most of the European nations at that time.\"\n\nIn addition, by the time of the first settlements, \"local government, that fertile germ of free institutions, had already taken deep root in English ways.\" Thus the English settlers came to America already committed to \"the dogma of the sovereignty of the people.\"\n\nMoreover, the northern settlers - and particularly the Puritans of New England - came to America not only with the general habits of freedom characteristic of all the English but with a peculiarly intense inclination toward self-government. They came, Tocqueville says, driven by a \"purely intellectual craving,\" seeking the \"triumph of an idea.\"\n\nThey wanted to establish communities based upon their Puritan religious and moral convictions. \"Puritanism,\" however, \"was not just a religious doctrine; in many respects, it shared the most absolute democratic and republican theories.\" These settlers had \"shaken off the pope's authority\" and \"acknowledged no other religious supremacy.\" Accordingly, they \"brought into the New World\" a \"democratic and republican\" form of Christianity,\" and \"this fact singularly favored the establishment of a temporal republic and democracy.\"\n\nFor Tocqueville, the North's combination of religion and self-government - and not the South's experience with slavery - set the tone for all of America. \"New England principles spread first to neighboring states and then in due course to those more distant, finally penetrating everywhere throughout the confederation.\" As a result, America was able to embark on its experiment with self-government at a time when most European nations were still ruled by absolute monarchies.\n\nTocqueville thus offers us a balanced account of America's origins, one that is both critical and respectful, one that acknowledges the fundamentally good character of our country without ignoring the evils that have marked its history.\n\nThe despotism of slavery arose within America and did much to mar its development. But the Americans who built the country were not fundamentally a despotic people. On the contrary, they were a freedom-loving people who sought to establish and perpetuate republican self-government.\n\nThis Tocquevillian interpretation of America's point of departure is certainly more plausible than the claim made by some today that America was \"founded on white supremacy.\" It is reasonable to suppose that what is fundamentally bad will tend to deteriorate and what is fundamentally good will tend to improve. Nazism was fundamentally established on an ideology of racism. Its evil accordingly grew more malignant over time and was only stopped by the application of overwhelming external force.\n\nSelf-generated improvement, however, has obviously been the course of American development. If slavery and racism were the deepest marks on America's national soul, then why would it have moved so consistently away from them and toward the establishment of freedom and equality?\n\nA fundamentally racist nation would not have produced the generation of leaders who, in 1787, placed in the Constitution a power to abolish the foreign slave trade and who publicly condemned slavery and openly hoped for its eventual abolition. A nation founded on white supremacy would not have exerted itself first to limit the scope of slavery, later to abolish slavery, and finally to eliminate racial discrimination.\n\nUltimately, in a certain sense, America turned out to be a better country than even Tocqueville appreciated. He was deeply pessimistic about the potential for racial peace in America, even if slavery should be eliminated. Because slavery had been based on race, he thought, nobody on either side would be able to forget it or move beyond it. White Americans would never overcome their prejudices against black Americans, and black Americans would forever burn with resentment about the wrongs that had been done to them.\n\nTocqueville was certainly correct that the dire legacy of slavery would not be eliminated immediately upon its abolition. America's path toward racial justice was long and difficult, continuing for many decades after the end of the Civil War. Nevertheless, over time the process turned out better than Tocqueville expected. The country was not engulfed in a race war, and whites and black Americans gradually learned to live with each other as fellow citizens.\n\nHere Tocqueville may have overlooked something about the Americans that he actually appreciated and examined closely in other contexts. Tocqueville is famous for his positive account of Christianity's influence on American democracy. Besides noting the aforementioned role of Puritanism in planting the seeds of self-government, he emphasized Christian morality's role in placing limits on the power of the majority in America, as well as its ability to elevate the souls of Americans above the narrow individualism and petty materialism that threatened to dominate their lives.\n\nThis is the truth but not the whole truth about Christianity. It also teaches its adherents to love their fellow human beings as created in the image and likeness of God, and demands that they forgive those who have wronged them just as they hope God will forgive their own wrongdoing. Indeed, Christianity provided Americans the moral and spiritual resources to overcome differences of race, to cast aside old prejudices, to seek and to bestow forgiveness for past injustices.\n\nRacism existed in America from the beginning, but America was not founded on white supremacy. It was instead founded, as Tocqueville teaches us, on the spirit of religion, freedom, and self-government - a benevolent spirit that gradually overcame racial injustice. This is the true and constructive account of our country that we ought to teach our children.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Biden's Attack On 'White Man's Culture' Is A Mix Of Historical Illiteracy And Dishonesty\n\nDuring a recent struggle session over his role in the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill Supreme Court hearings of 1991, prospective presidential candidate Joe Biden declared that the United States had a centuries-old embedded cultural problem with permissive violence against women. \"It's an English jurisprudential culture,\" Biden explained this week, \"a white man's culture. It's got to change.\"\n\n\"English jurisprudential culture\" is, of course, the foundation of American governance and our Constitutional rights. It's unlikely any culture in history has brought more freedom and prosperity to more of humankind. Now, it's true that the tenets of thhis culture have fallen into disfavor with the progressives who Biden is trying to woo. But does any educated person truly believe that \"English jurisprudential culture\" has been more prone towards misogyny than other societies?\n\nHow has Chinese jurisprudential culture performed for women over history? How about Indian jurisprudential culture ? Or Russian jurisprudential culture ? Or sub-Saharan African jurisprudential culture ? How has Islamic jurisprudential culture worked out for women? The \"English jurisprudential culture\" of New Zealand was the first to grant all women the right to vote in 1893, followed over the next decades by an array of other English and formerly English colonies. Saudi Arabia granted women that same right only in 2011. Then again, the women of 1893 \"English jurisprudential culture\"-voting rights or not-were already leading freer and safer lives than most of the women who have to function under the deeply illiberal legal cultures of the Islamic world today.\n\nThose who demand acts of contrition over \"English jurisprudential culture,\" seem to have a problem with ideals of blind justice and due process that stop us from sacrificing people to the whims of an aggrieved mob. Biden's transgression against progressivism, as far as I can tell, was affirming to Thomas during the Hill hearings that, \"from the beginning and at this moment, until the end, the presumption [of innocence] is with you.\" It wasn't true.\n\nThough it's quite puzzling why the former vice president laments the \"white\" cultural evils of American jurisprudence when mentioning his role in the Thomas Supreme Court hearings. Perhaps confessing racial guilt is merely a form of ritual self-flagellation these days. Then again, it was Biden, with the assistance of a bunch of other white men, helped smear a black man with an impeccable record and no corroborating evidence of wrongdoing simply because he held the wrong kind of views. It was to Biden that Thomas was responding when he famously called the hearings a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you.\"\n\nIf anything, Biden should be apologizing to Thomas.\n\nIt was also the loquacious former Delaware senator with the unearned intellectual self-confidence who helped turn Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into salacious, nasty, and hyper-politicized events we saw during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Yet, Biden now says he regrets that he \"couldn't come up with a way\" to give Hill \"the kind of hearing she deserved.\"\n\nWhat did Hill deserve? In an English jurisprudential culture, Hill was free to make her accusations against the powerful nominee of the Supreme Court in front of the entire nation. Hill was able to tell her story to a free press that took her side. She was free to write a books laying out her positions and story. Her allies were free to produce revisionist films casting her as a hero and a victim .\n\nUnlike the accusation against Kavanaugh, Hill's allegations of sexual harassment were potentially a criminal matter. And in that regard, Hill wasn't a credible accuser . Not a single person-and Thomas had scores of subordinates working for him during his years in government- came forward to substantiate that the judge had ever acted in the ways described by Hill towards anyone else. Twelve former female colleagues of Thomas and Hill signed an affidavit supporting him. Not one person who worked with both came forward to vouch for Hill.\n\nThe FBI investigated Hill's claims against Thomas-though she was always reluctant to cooperate-and not only did it fail to find any evidence to back her accusation, but after the hearings, agents sent additional affidavits to the Senate accusing Hill of misleading the public by skipping portions of her story and offering public testimony that contradicted what she had told law enforcement officials.\n\nTo say the United States can do better as a nation is one thing. To claim that the injustice exists is fair. To claim that \"English\" or \"white\" culture is a unique purveyor of racism and misogyny in the world is the kind historical illiteracy that might be soothing to the ears of the victimhood brigades that inhabit the contemporary left, but it's not reality. It certainly shouldn't mainstreamed by those who have sworn to protect this jurisprudential culture-even (and perhaps especially) if they desperately want to become president.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "NYC Councilwoman Freaks Out Over White Man Holding Black Child: 'It Hurts People'\n\n'This is how black and indigenous people of color see the world and it's not for you and me ... to deny that reality,' Council Member Shino Tanikawa said.\n\nMembers of New York City's Community Education Council District 2 (CEC D2) behaved like the children they are meant to represent in last week's meeting, when discussions of a joke from a past meeting devolved into screaming, personal attacks, and slanders.\n\nDuring the council's June meeting, the group was tackling school integration. Council member Thomas Wrocklage had brought his toddler daughter and a friend's nephew. The nephew spent much of the meeting climbing on and off Wrocklage's lap.\n\nThis innocent image of a man holding a child was the target of scorn by his fellow council members. Rachel Broshi told Wrocklage, \"It hurts people when they see a white man bouncing a brown baby on their lap and they don't know the context. That is harmful.\"\n\nBroshi, and several other council members, argued that the image of a white man holding a black child was inherently racist. When Wrocklage asked Broshi to explain why holding a friend's nephew was racist merely due to their differing races, Broshi refused, yelling at Wrocklage, \"Read a book. Read Ibram Kendi. Read 'White Fragility.' Read 'How to Talk to White People.'\"\n\nWrocklage's question was never answered. How is it not racist to be offended by the sight of a child being held by someone of a differing race?\n\nIt was not just the image of Wrocklage holding his friend's nephew that caused outrage. During a discussion on ending screening in New York City schools and increasing integration processes, Wrocklage argued that increasing integration efforts were important, and had to begin as early as elementary school, contrary to the popular proposal of beginning in middle school. During his argument, he said, \"My living room's integrated right now,\" in reference to the visit from his friend, who happened to be black.\n\nSome on the council took the comment as a joke, and accused Wrocklage of purposefully belittling the problems of segregation and even minimizing slavery. Council member Emily Hellstrom monologued for several minutes, accusing Wrocklage of racism and prescribing malicious intent.\n\nIn the aftermath of the meeting, Wrocklage faced an onslaught of allegations of racism on social media. Around 100 parents in District 2 signed a letter to Maud Maron, the president of the school board, complaining about Wrocklage, who claims the letter slanders him with false allegations.\n\nEven Wrocklage's defense of himself was portrayed in a harmful light. No amount of contextualizing saved him from the accusations of racism. Once the accusation was charged, he was labeled, and it was never going away.\n\nNever mind that his comment was intended to push for increased scholastic integration. It wasn't important that his laughter was not at the comment, but an involuntary and natural reaction to watching children play. They declared him guilty, and all exculpatory facts were ignored.\n\nA recurring theme throughout the meeting was that, while it was fine to tell someone his actions are racist, the accuser had no responsibility to explain why. Instead, sizable focus was placed on the importance of \"doing the work,\" as Council Member Shino Tanikawa said, as she called for increased anti-racism training for the council.\n\nShe further expressed, \"There is no way around it, you have to read. If you're not willing to read, then you're not doing the work. This is work we all have to do. You can disagree with people, but this is not an ideological difference. This is how black and indigenous people of color see the world and it's not for you and me ... to deny that reality. We have to get on board.\"\n\nThis meeting forebodes a dark time for New York public schools. The members of this council could not hold a meeting without devolving into screaming matches and personal attacks. Further, members of the council successfully wielded accusations of racism as a tool to silence political opponents. It's a very convenient argument when you can tell anyone who disagrees with you that he needs to \"do the work\" and you have no obligation to discuss in good faith.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "The Right Can't Ignore The Rise Of White Supremacy On Campus\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has released and updated a troubling study about the rise of white supremacist messaging on America's college campuses. Incidents tripled in 2017 compared to the prior year. While the total number of incidents in 2017 was only 290, the increase from 147 in 2016 should serve as a wake-up call to address a new and insidious form of white supremacist rhetoric.\n\nBy far the most active group spreading these messages was Identity Evropa, a self-described \"fraternal organization for people of European heritage located in the United States.\" According to the study, this group \"use[s] propaganda that avoids recognizable white supremacist imagery and language. For example, IE has used black and white images of classical sculptures, including Michelangelo's David or Nicolas Coustou's Julius Caesar.\" The messages on these images, in the form of posters or fliers, say things like, \"The future belongs to us.\"\n\nThis is not exactly the white supremacy of the Klu Klux Klan. The new breed of racists has traded in white sheets for collared shirts and khakis. The best known of these new racist activists is Duke University-educated Richard Spencer, who not only presents himself as a reasonable and friendly guy, but co-opts the techniques of progressive identity politics in some cases.\n\nRecently he commended Cornel West's attacks on Ta-Nehisi Coates. West argued Coates was fetishizing white supremacy and promoting a neo-liberal agenda, to which Spencer tweeted, \"He's not wrong.\" In fact, Spencer's safe-sounding organization, the National Policy Institute, also attacks neo-liberalism, corporate capitalism, and aggressive U.S. military and foreign policy. Identity Evropa is connected to NPI .\n\nCollege campuses have become the powder keg of race relations in the United States. It was, after all, protests on the campus of the University of Missouri that helped lead to NFL players' protests over the past two seasons. The necktie racists of groups like Identity Evropa are taking advantage of a divisive approach to anti-racist pedagogy that may be disaffecting an increasing number of young white men.\n\nThere is an almost endless parade of academic hot-takes on race that range from dumb to dangerous. The dumb takes include ideas that things like yoga or ethnic food are racist. The dangerous include increasing demands for mandatory courses expressing progressive racial ideology, calls for segregation, and a desire to redress historical inequality by valuing voices and opinions based on the speaker's race.\n\nAll of this provides opportunity for dosing out the evil, insidious snake oil of white supremacy on our country's campuses. Not included in the ADL study is the increasing use of fliers and posters saying, \"It's okay to be white.\" The phrase may sound innocuous, but it can be an opening to dangerous messaging.\n\nThe Spencers of the world say: \"Hey, I'm not racist, I'm just realistic. They are tearing down your statues, nobody else's; They are taking your history out of the textbooks, nobody else's; They are telling you, young white man, to shut up, and nobody else.\"\n\nThe debate over whether progressive racial ideologies such as white privilege and cultural appropriation on campuses has gone too far is an important one, and worth having. But it is unlikely to abate the rise of white supremacy on campus in the short term. To do that, we need a different approach.\n\nLast month, a Republican member of Congress invited Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson to be his guest at the State of the Union address. Many, including the congressman, shrugged it off, saying, well, he didn't know, it was an honest mistake. That's just not good enough. The coin of the white supremacist realm is credibility. A photo of Johnson at the SOTU above one of his vile screeds would be very dangerous - it normalizes his views in a powerful way.\n\nWhat conservatives must begin to do is to actively, not reactively, seek out and oppose those who spread hatred to college students. It is not enough to say, \"These people are on the fringe, let's laugh it off.\" Instead, conservative groups, especially those dealing with education, must forcefully denounce these individuals and groups, as William F. Buckley Jr. once denounced the John Birch Society.\n\nIn another incident last month, Paul Nehlen, who ran against Speaker Paul Ryan in the GOP primary in 2016, launched an anti-Semitic Twitter thread that included a spreadsheet list of Jews (many of whom weren't Jews) in the media. The reaction was troubling. There were a lot of jokes, a lot of brushing it off as the musings of an idiot.\n\nWhat was lacking was much earnest concern that Nehlen may have been tapping into a growing vein of white supremacy in the United States. It may be a small fringe, but the ADL numbers show its activities and prominence are growing. This shouldn't be shrugged at.\n\nLast year's tragedy in Charlottesville must wake up conservative campus groups and the organizations and individuals that support them. The approach of the past several years, which has included invitations to figures like Spencer and his ilk, has been a terrible failure. Conservatives cannot shock or provoke academia into taking a more sensible approach to race. If anything, the approach calcifies, and to some justifies, the very progressive ideas that created the opening for white supremacists in the first place.\n\nWhat is needed is a new approach, one that looks and reaches out to the legitimate concerns of people of color. Issues like the black-white income gap and disparate treatment in criminal justice are as important as progressive threats to campus speech. It's important for conservatives to fight for ideological diversity on campus, but that, in and of itself, cannot be the only concern. We also must hear how conservative ideas can help solve the problems in our society.\n\nWe need fewer campus appearances from Milo Yiannopoulos and more from David French. We need to hear fewer grievances about the destruction of Western culture and more description of how that culture, with its dedication to liberty, offers the best path forward to a more equal society.\n\nThe forces of white supremacy are not as large in number as they once were, but they may well be more sophisticated. More than anything else, they rely on a narrative that colleges are stacked against white people in policies, in admissions, and in teaching. Conservatives must be more circumspect in how we address that perception and narrative.\n\nJumping on every example of ridiculous policies about who can say, wear, or eat what is great for clicks, but is it making a dent in the way colleges actually treat race? It's not clear that it is. This is an issue where reasonable people of all political stripes should be able to sit together and find solutions.\n\nIt is an opportunity for conservatives to make absolutely clear that they oppose and will actively fight white supremacy, and for progressives to really listen to serious conservative ideas about how to create greater opportunity for all Americans. The scourge of white supremacists could be a catalyst for compromise that unites the Right and Left in colleges. Until that happens, expect the rise of white supremacy on our nation's campuses to get much worse.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "White Paternalism Is Racism Too\n\nRacism isn't solved by exalting race to a daily catechesis and 'elevating black voices' in a form of white saviorism. This paternalism is everywhere.\n\nThe riots in the wake of George Floyd's killing have been decried by some black leaders, but you wouldn't know it from listening to the media.\n\nL. Joy Williams, president of the Brooklyn NAACP, tweeted Saturday, \"I know that our anger and frustration is real. I feel it myself and I know it exists in my community and in Black people across this country. But my gut is telling me that something nefarious is going on here.\"\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP legal defense fund also tweeted: \"Seeing some troubling clips. I hope that someone is putting together the clips of incidents from the various protests that appear to be perpetrated by ppl who are not protesting police violence but appear to have different motives and agendas.\"\n\nRead into their comments what you will - criticisms of Antifa or others - these voices have been effectively silenced. If only I had a dollar this week for every time a white social media influencer argued the riots are justified , or for every time a blue check mark begged their peers to acknowledge their privilege and fight broad-brush \"systemic racism.\"\n\nMaybe I live in a particularly woke bubble. As the mother of two black children, I purposely follow other interracial families on social media to learn from their experiences. I also live in Waco, Texas, a place desperately hoping to overcome a deeply racist history. I am thoroughly surrounded by voices supporting rioters and bidding others to confess their privilege.\n\nWhat I find in the place of overt racism, however, is aggressive paternalism. It is stunning to hear both public figures and my friends in the suburbs speaking sympathetically of the rioters. Arguing that black rioters or looters should be held to a lower standard than other Americans because of \"black anger\" is so patently racist, it confounds me.\n\n\"People didn't cause the riots, the system did,\" is a sentiment that denies agency. Statements denying that the African Americans rioting in Minneapolis, Oakland, and Atlanta have the will to make their own choices should shock us with their dehumanization. Yet these sentiments have gone positively viral thanks to the woke warriors of our time.\n\nWorse still, these woke saviors draw attention away from the questions that ought to be asked about, say, police procedures. For example, the Military Times surveyed police departments across the United States and found that more than half give preference to applicants from the military. Another 2017 study of Miami and Boston police departments found that officers with military backgrounds were more likely to have a use-of-force complaint filed against them.\n\nI am grateful to military veterans for their sacrifices. I'm not convinced, however, that a deployment to a battlefield in Fallujah translates well into policing the streets of American cities. While both are guardians of law and order, their approaches are different.\n\nWhat happens to applicants who are not from military backgrounds? At least one police department in my area assigns non-military applicants to \"do time\" as correctional officers in prisons, a prerequisite to patrolling. What is it like for a correctional officer who guards known cartel members in prison, for instance, and then is reassigned to police a Hispanic neighborhood? Is that really a seamless transition?\n\nThese questions don't deny that society needs law enforcement; they don't imagine a progressive utopia wherein we can somehow survive without police. But these are the kind of practical policy questions we must be asking our local officials.\n\nInstead, what's popularly labeled \"progress\" is a repackaged white man's burden. A white friend once told me she discusses race with her children \"daily\" because it's the responsibility of having privilege. Never mind that exalting race to a daily catechesis might in fact serve to teach children that race is a fundamental factor in human worth - which is the very definition of racism. Elsewhere, I've seen the call for white people to \"elevate black voices,\" incidentally forging a new form of white saviorism. Paternalism is everywhere.\n\nI am committed to anyone who will make America a more just place for my children to live. Like many Americans, I am hungry for it. It's time for concrete efforts to end police brutality, rather than virtue-signaling social media campaigns. Point out bad policies. Propose solutions.\n\nSome of us want to listen.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

After these comments, Mills played the race card when she lost control of her rhetoric and found it hard to counter the arguments of Republican strategist David Urban. \"I'm not going to be lectured by some white man who has no idea what he's talking about,\" she said. \"Listen, this isn't the first time we heard this kind of talk from Donald Trump, and it reeks of authoritarianism,\" Mills began. \"It also harkens back to a time of Hitler who used the same exact language that Donald Trump is now quoting to talk about the people who he thinks are poisoning the blood of the nation.\" \"You know, all of this smells like an affinity towards eugenics, which really should give us all pause, because when we remember the last person, the last awful authoritarian dictator who believed in eugenics, it was someone who really wanted to exterminate an entire people because they thought that they didn't have good genes and because they were trying to create a certain type of race,\" she added. Urban responded by saying it was \"just shameful\" of Mills \"to compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler\" as he reminded her that Trump wasn't talking about the genes of any race but of those belonging to \"people who came into this country and murdered Americans.\" Urban was referring to a report that 13,000 convicted murderers and 435,000 people with criminal records are among the millions who have entered the US illegally during the Biden-Harris administration. Mills insisted Urban was just \"doing Donald Trump's bidding\" and that she was at risk of being exterminated by Trump.

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE RELEASE: Matt Walsh's 'Am I Racist' premieres new video from Bryson Gray\n\n\"They're gonna say that I'm racist, but they say everyone is racist, I guess that means nobody is racist, now it doesn't mean much when you say it.\"\n\n\"They're gonna say that I'm racist, but they say everyone is racist, I guess that means nobody is racist, now it doesn't mean much when you say it.\"\n\nMatt Walsh's new film Am I Racist drops in theaters on September 13 but bits and pieces are already leaking out. The Post Millennial got access to an early download of the new song for the film from Bryson Gray, and we got to talk to him about how he connected with Walsh and what he makes of identity politics (hint: he doesn't like it). The new film is on a topic that has been prevalent in the US for the past few decades: anti-racism and DEI. It's been yet another instance of people trying to tell Americans what to think, say and feel. Gray was instantly on board with the concept, saying that as soon as he heard from The Daily Wire team, he wanted to work on it. They sent him some beats, and within an hour, he said, he had a lyrics track back to them. Gray wrote the title track for the film, including the key lyric \"they're gonna say that I'm racist, but they say everyone is racist, I guess that means nobody is racist, now it doesn't mean much when you say it.\" This is the crux of the point, and The Post Millennial caught up with Gray to talk about it.\n\nWhen asked about the rise of anti-racism, which seems to correlate somehow to a rise in racism (don't take my word for it, ask The New York Times), Gray said that he believes that persistent push \"is supposed to demonize a specific group of people and that's white men.\" The film dives into this as well, showing Walsh posing as a liberal white man, the kind that would attend a White Men for Kamala Zoom call in a man bun and skinny jeans, trying to \"do the work\" of anti-racism. That phrase, \"do the work,\" opens Gray's video, and has become synonymous with anti-racist struggle sessions where white men and women confess their racism. In some cases, these folx fork over thousands of dollars for black activists (read: grifters) to tell them they are racist and instruct them to pay out even more cash to assuage their guilt. \"A lot of times,\" Gray told The Post Millennial, \"this propaganda is being pushed by women.\" Author Robin DiAngelo is one of these women, and Walsh speaks to her in the film, only DiAngelo has no idea who Walsh is while he knows exactly who she is. Another woman who pushes this race-baiting grift is Saira Rao, who hosts dinner parties for white women to drink wine, spend thousands of dollars, and be berated about their complicity in white supremacy. One of the biggest issues with calling everyone racist, Gray said, and painting all white people as white supremacists, all black people as criminals, which has been a stereotype perpetrated by, y'know, actual racists, is that to do this is to lie. \"What we can't do as Christians is bear false witness,\" he said. \"Racism has a specific definition, but they keep trying to twist it to mean something else, like they do with gender, and that's bearing false witness,\" he said. \"Academics like to slap on the propaganda because it suits their agenda.\"\n\nAs the election season heats up, there are more and more claims by political parties about how they've secured the \"black vote\" or the \"Hispanic vote,\" and Gray said that it's wrong to paint a group of Americans as speaking with one voice based entirely on their race. Americans used to know this before the era of anti-racism. \"It's identity politics,\" he said, \"and it's funny because for the party that claims to be one of inclusion, it's funny how much time they spend making a hyper-focus on these issues. Usually we judge people on their character, or their values, and that's how I know if I can mix with someone.\" \"We have to get past making judgments about people solely on color because it's irrational,\" Gray said. That irrationality hasn't been enough to stop leftists from demanding that everyone in every industry and across all platforms view everything through the lens of race and racism. That's what critical theory is all about, and it's what Walsh and Gray set about debunking in this new film.

It's the one thing in this world I am interested in, beyond making money, having a good time and getting enough sleep.\"\n\nActor Morgan Freeman has reiterated his spite for Black History Month as he did in an old clip that has floated around the internet for years. \"I detest it,\" he told a reporter last week.\n\nFreeman, who has long been a critic of Black History Month, told Variety in an interview about the subject, \"I detest it. The mere idea of it.\"\n\n\"You are going to give me the shortest month in a year? And you are going to celebrate 'my' history? This whole idea makes my teeth itch.

There is no cultural sin a white person can commit that is worse than being white. Trying to figure out how to navigate this, as a white man, is the premise of Matt Walsh's latest film Am I Racist? The film premiered in a Nashville-area multi-plex on Monday night.\n\nThe film is at times sarcastic and at times earnest, with Walsh going to workshops against whiteness with recognized anti-racism experts and speaking to anti-racist spokespersons who claim to have been oppressed by white people. The film opens with Walsh seeming to do some real soul-searching, just the kind the progressive left wants white men to do to get them to shut up, recognize their privilege, step back, and cede whatever authority or opportunities they have to those who are not white or male or \"cisgender\" or straight. \"You're probably wondering if this is real,\" Walsh asks. \"The answer is yes, it's real. That's me, Matt Walsh, in real life, with the man bun and the skinny jeans on an actual news show as a certified DEI expert.\"\n\nHe attends a workshop where a black woman charging $30,000 to hold the event says she's not safe among the white people attending her seminar due entirely to their skin color, and hers. When asked about this, she said \"Being an African American in primarily white spaces is not safe for me, mentally or emotionally.\" She promised to go more in-depth on that, but Walsh is discovered before he can get a real answer.\n\nHe questions every choice he makes, including whether or not ordering black coffee is somehow racist. I mean it could be, right? In the era of micro-aggressions, anything is possible. All this to say that he set out to \"do the work.\" Bryson Gray provides a rap track to the film delving into this very concept. Walsh doesn't start out undercover, but he realizes that the only way to get honest answers from people is if they don't know who he really is. He dons a man bun wig, skinny jeans, a tweed blazer, and refashions himself as a liberal male-feminist type who hates his own whiteness and wants to un-racist himself.\n\nIf mainstream culture is to be believed, being white goes along with an aversion to spicy food, being unable to dance, being privileged over all others, entitlement, creating race in order to oppress people, being fragile, and if you're a man, being either an evil oppressor or the butt of jokes. Many universities even offer whiteness studies courses, but these are the only ethnic or racial studies courses that primarily teach hatred of the subject instead of discussing pride or accomplishments. Indeed, \"white pride\" is an abhorrent concept, while black pride is praised and pride in hailing from other minority groups is also celebrated. There's an entire movement dedicated to fostering and bragging about pride in being a minority when it comes to sexual preference or gender identity.\n\nAmong the left-leaning pundits and academics in the United States, which constitutes the majority, speaking about whiteness can only be done with derision. White race scholars, and I use the term loosely, like Robin DiAngelo, are essentially self-hating due to their own race. Yet these are the people from whom white Americans are supposed to take their marching orders when it comes to perceptions of race and racism. The rhetoric and vitriol have become so heated that a white person's stating that they are not racist is akin to an admission of racism and a white person's stating that they \"don't see color,\" and do not therefore discriminate against persons based on race, is too an admission that they are simply racist.\n\nThis is what Walsh learns as he frequents bookshops to educate himself on anti-racism. He attends a workshop by Race 2 Dinner grifters Saira Rao, who admittedly hates white people, and her partner Regina Jackson. The two hold dinner parties in the homes of wine-drinking white women, charging thousands of dollars to tell the women that they're racist. They insist that even those women with black husbands and biracial babies, even those women engaged in \"the work,\" are nothing more than racist mouthpieces who are complicit in the racist settler colonialism of white men.\n\nThe theory has been building to break through the surface for decades and can be traced back to two seminal ideas, both of which emerged in 1989. Kimberle Crenshaw created the concept of intersectionality, or the condition of being oppressed in multiple ways on account of having multiple identities, all of which are discriminated against by society at large. Her essay was called \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex.\" In that same year, Harvard-educated Peggy MacIntosh, a researcher at Wellesley Centers for Women, authored \"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack.\" In it, she discussed the \"unearned\" privileges white people had, just as a matter of course, simply due to their skin color. Since then, it has only compounded.\n\nAbout a decade ago, I wrote a short play called Auto Moron detailing this compounding. It followed a young woman who got auto-correct installed in her brain to stop her from sounding racist. When she explained this to her friend, her friend asked \"so you don't mind being racist, you just want to stop sounding racist?\" The young woman says that as a white person, she knows she can't not be racist, saying \"It's hard-wired into my white person DNA.\" But at the very least, she'd like to not sound racist-hence, the new auto-correct feature to prevent her from committing any micro-aggressions against minorities.\n\nSo where does that all leave white people who don't want to hate themselves? White people are left with two options in the progressive rubric, either be racist, or do the work. This is what was facing cultural commentator Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire as he embarked on his latest film, and the company's first theatrical release, Am I Racist? The film takes a similar approach to his previous cinematic venture, What Is a Woman? in that it focuses around the central question. But in this case, instead of outright blasting the leftist view that all white people are racist, such as he did with the gender ideology that questions the nature of biological reality in saying that men who say they are women really are women, Am I Racist? sees Walsh engaging with leftist critical race theory by attempting to subordinate himself to its precepts.\n\nIn a moment of ultimate trolling, Walsh manages to land an interview with White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo, for a fee of several thousand dollars. She asks who he is, saying \"I had to ask who you are because you have to be careful.\"\n\n\"Never be too careful,\" Walsh says, in a disguise that even fooled attendees at the Democrat National Convention before he was outed and ejected from the Chicago event by security.\n\nDiAngelo tells him her theory, that white people must acknowledge the race of black people and acknowledge the assumptions they may have about those persons. She insists that even if you do not believe you have negative assumptions, you do. This is part of the concept of unconscious bias. In the end, he convinces her to give cash to one of the film's producers as a means of reparations simply because he is black. Before DiAngelo hands over bills from her wallet, she apologizes to Ben, the producer, saying \"Well, on behalf of myself and my fellow white people, I apologize. It is not you. It is us. As long as I'm standing I will do my best to challenge it.\"\n\nShe admits that she found the exchange \"weird,\" that having the approach to reparations be personal, and not systemic, could cause \"some people\" to be \"offended.\" And while DiAngelo sat with her discomfort, the crux of the problem became clear. For the progressive left, racism can only be solved by governments and institutions and white people must atone for their original sin of skin by feeling guilt on behalf of their entire race. For conservatives, racism is not an inherent condition, but is overcome in personal relationships, much like Daryl Davis, who reformed KKK members one at a time.\n\nIn the end, Walsh concludes that anti-racist teaching is \"a lie meant to manipulate us.\" The entire anti-racist industry, in his view, is a grift designed to encourage all people, regardless of race, to \"be bitter and angry and resentful. They're selling us the disease. They're telling us there's no cure.\"\n\nAs with all bogus ideologies, what it takes is for good men and women to say \"no,\" to not go along with the narrative, to fight back, with their words, with their satire, with their courage. We were told that \"black lives matter\" is doctrine and \"all lives matter\" is racist. We were told that white parents must indoctrinate their children to hate their own skin color before they could even talk. We were told that to be white is to be racist. We were told that America itself is evil because it was founded by white men. All of it is a wretched lie, and it behooves us all to speak out against it, to not remain silent, and to do the real work of speaking truth.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
