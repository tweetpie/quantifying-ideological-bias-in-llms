I don't want equality and justice for Black folks. So I say to those that say, wokeness, wokeness, wokeness. We're anti-woke.' This is not wokeness, what we talked about in here, and you should be on the side of folks who are woke because we are saying no more oppression against our community,\" Bush said.\n\n\"So whatever else is being thrown around, unless you are saying, 'I'm racist, white supremacist, and I'm bigoted,' stop talking about wokeness,\" Bush continued. \"And you can't tell me that I'm wrong because I'm from the very movement where this came about. Don't let a fascist tell you what being woke means.\"\n\nWatch below or at this link ."

      "text": "Cori Bush knocks Marjorie Taylor Greene for boasting about armed insurrection\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia asserted over the weekend that former President Donald Trump's right-wing mob would have pulled off a successful coup had she and erstwhile Trump adviser Steve Bannon organized the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol.\n\n\"I want to tell you something, if Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. Not to mention, we would've been armed,\" Greene said Saturday night at the annual New York Young Republican Club dinner, during which the club's president instructed a throng of white nationalists and other far-right figures, including Donald Trump Jr., to prepare for \"total war.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), who has called for the expulsion of Greene and other congressional Republicans accused of helping to plot the deadly insurrection, responded on social media by asking, \"And then what?\"\n\nAs Rolling Stone reported Sunday:\n\nGreene is among the GOP lawmakers accused of giving reconnaissance tours of the Capitol to insurrectionists before the deadly attack. She has also been a staunch defender of the rioters jailed for violently attempting to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, referring to them as \"political prisoners.\"\n\nMore than 950 people have been arrested so far. That includes nearly 300 individuals who have been charged with assaulting or obstructing law enforcement as well as two leaders of the far-right Oath Keepers militia who were recently convicted of seditious conspiracy. In the immediate aftermath of Trump's failed coup, Greene and 146 other congressional Republicans voted to reverse Biden's decisive win.\n\n\"Very soon,\" historian Harvey Kaye warned Monday morning, House Democrats \"hand over power to the likes of her.\""

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush pushes to expel lawmakers who incited violent assault on Capitol\n\nIn response to supporters of President Donald Trump storming the U.S. Capitol during a joint congressional session on Wednesday in what many have denounced as a violent terrorist attack and attempted coup, newly sworn-in Rep. Cori Bush announced that her first formal act will target her colleagues who incited the chaos.\n\nThe siege of the Capitol came after an inflammatory speech by the president and as over 100 Republicans in Congress were in the process of contesting the Electoral College victory of President-elect Joe Biden, who is set to take office in two weeks. The two chambers had ended the joint session to debate a GOP challenge to Arizona's presidential election results when the pro-Trump mob forced a lockdown.\n\n\"My first resolution in Congress will be to call for the expulsion of the Republican members of Congress who incited this domestic terror attack on the Capitol,\" tweeted Bush, a Black Lives Matter activist and Democrat who took the oath of office to represent Missouri's First Congressional District on Sunday.\n\nThe announcement came after Bush said : \"My team and I are safe. I am in disbelief. I can't believe domestic terrorists are roaming around inside the Capitol. I'm remembering being brutalized and treated like a domestic terrorist just for protesting to keep my people alive. St. Louis: you're in my heart right now.\"\n\nTweeting from her congressional account on Wednesday, Bush added that Trump \"has incited a riot\" and \"our country deserves better.\"\n\nVarious progressive organizations and at least one fellow Democrat in Congress expressed support for Bush's forthcoming resolution.\n\nBill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.Y.)-who argued last month that Republicans backing Trump's effort to overturn the November election shouldn't be sworn in for the next session of Congress because they were violating the U.S. Constitution and House rules- tweeted that he has signed on to Bush's resolution.\n\n\"Any House members who have tried to overturn the election and install a dictatorship have violated the Constitution and should not sit in Congress,\" he said.\n\nThe group IfNotNow said it backs the resolution \" 100% \" while People for Bernie thanked Bush for the move and Justice Democrats noted her leadership.\n\n\"This is the standard for Democratic members of Congress right now,\" declared Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas.\n\nRL Miller, founder of the advocacy group Climate Hawks Vote and a member of the Democratic National Committee, tweeted : \"Hey mainstream Dem leadership. You working with freshman @RepCori on this or making her look like an outlier?\"\n\nMiller, a Californian, specifically directed her message at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.).\n\nOthers quickly urged their members of Congress to sign on to Bush's effort:\n\nColor of Change president Rashad Robinson thanked Bush for \"holding the enablers accountable for the violence they incited,\" adding that \"the entire Republican Party stoked this flame, and they are complicit in this.\"\n\nAs the Los Angeles chapter of the youth-led Sunrise Movement put it : \"The problem is so much larger than making the Congress doors impenetrable. Let's start addressing the underlying issues that led to today.\"\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Sunrise Movement co-founder and executive director Varshini Prakash delivered a message to Biden, Pelosi, and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.):\n\nSunrise co-founder and national political director Evan Weber thanked Bush for the resolution. \"They are tyrants,\" he said of those targeted by her resolution. \"Expel and impeach every last one of them.\"\n\nBrand New Congress said it \"stands with\" Bush and pointed out that \"citizens fear for their lives right now.\"\n\n\"GOP terrorists invaded the Capitol,\" the group wrote on Twitter, and cops and the military \"didn't stop them.\"\n\nDeclaring that \"the Capitol is OUR Capitol\" and \"our representatives represent US,\" Brand New Congress said that the GOP \"can no longer destroy democracy.\"\n\nJournalist David Roberts said of Bush's resolution, \"This is the only sane response.\"\n\nBush's resolution plans come amid calls for again impeaching Trump, removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment, or even arresting him. Her fellow Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) announced Wednesday that she is already prepping articles of impeachment.\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, announced Wednesday evening that after speaking with congressional leaders, the Defense and Justice departments, and Vice President Mike Pence (Trump was not listed), they have decided to proceed with certifying Biden's win \"tonight at the Capitol once it is cleared for use.\"\n\nAs lawmakers returned to the Capitol, the Center for Popular Democracy Action co-executive director Brian Kettering said in a statement that \"President Trump and the Republican congressmembers who refused to accept the fact that millions of us organized and voted to elect Joe Biden, and who illegally sought to contest battleground states' electors, are responsible for the violent attack on our country today.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake-by feeding lies about the election in order to undermine the voice of the people, they encouraged an angry mob of armed right-wing protestors and white supremacists to descend on our Capitol in a shocking display of physical violence and chaos that led to the disruption of government and the death of at least one person,\" Kettering continued.\n\nEndorsing the calls for impeachment by Omar and others, Kettering declared that \"Donald Trump and members of Congress must face consequences for inciting an attempted coup to stop the peaceful transition of power, which is enshrined into our Constitution.\" He also warned that the next two weeks \"offer a terrible opportunity for Trump to continue to fan the flames of even more violence and abuse of his presidential power.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, we support the resolution introduced by Rep. Cori Bush calling for the investigation and possible expulsion of the members of Congress who have voiced support for a reversal of the election, a group which includes more than 120 representatives as well as 13 senators,\" he added. \"We cannot stand by while the very people elected to protect our democracy encourage violent attempts to overthrow the government.\""

Marjorie Taylor Greene hasn't been shy about expressing her total disdain for progressive Democrats serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar. And according to Business Insider, another Democratic progressive, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, is changing offices after being \"berated\" by Greene in a hallway inside the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Panetta reports, \"In a statement to Insider, Bush said the incident in question occurred on January 13 when she was walking to the floor to vote - one week after the January 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. She said Greene 'came up from behind' her 'ranting loudly into her phone while not wearing a mask.' After Bush asked Greene to put on a mask, Bush said Greene 'responded by berating her,' with a member of Greene's staff telling her to 'stop inciting violence with Black Lives Matter.'\"\n\nBush is not the first progressive in the House to express concerns about sharing the Capitol Building with some of the more far-right House Republicans. Ocasio-Cortez has said that when far-right extremists attacked the Capitol Building on January 6, she literally feared for her life - and feared that some of the QAnon sympathizers in Congress would tell the insurgents where she was taking shelter.\n\nGreene has been a supporter of the QAnon movement. QAnon supporters were among the extremists who stormed the Capitol Building, along with members of the Proud Boys.\n\nHouse Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have been speaking out against Greene this week in response to reports that she has a history of advocating violence against Democrats - including Pelosi herself. And a few conservative House Republicans have called Greene out as well, including Rep. Adam Kinzinger - who has described the Georgia congresswoman as \"cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.\""

Republicans thought it was her name\n\nWhen Democratic Congresswoman-elect Cori Bush wore a Breonna Taylor face mask during an orientation session for new members of the U.S. House of Representatives, she did so in memory of a victim of police overreach and the War on Drugs. And upon seeing that mask, some Republican members of Congress assumed that Bush's name was Breonna Taylor and addressed her as \"Breonna.\"\n\nAppearing on CNN's \"OutFront\" on Monday night, November 16, Bush told host Erin Burnett that she was sad to see those Republicans didn't even know who Taylor was. Taylor, a 26-year-old frontline health worker in Louisville, Kentucky, was unarmed when she was killed by police during a botched no-knock drug raid in March. And activists for Black Lives Matter and other proponents of police reform have been citing Taylor's death as a glaring and tragic example of how horribly the War on Drugs has failed. No drugs were found in Taylor's apartment.\n\nThe progressive Bush - whose campaign was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City and the group Justice Democrats - told Burnett that when a Republican member of Congress addressed her as \"Breonna,\" it \"did not seem like they were being malicious.\" But Bush told Burnett that after more Republicans called her by that name during the orientation session, \"I really started to feel hurt. Because I'm like, 'This has been a national movement. The reports are: somewhere between 15 and 26 million people protested up to July- from June into July. How do you not know?'\"\n\nThe progressive Missouri Democrat continued, \"We signed up to be leaders. We have to know what's happening in our communities - and not only our communities, but what's happening in other communities. Because that's how we keep our people safe.\"\n\nBurnett was shocked, telling Bush, \"It is saying something - they really did not even know who she was ? And what was their reaction? Did you try to explain?\"\n\nBush responded, \"Yeah, I did - to each person who called me 'Breonna.' It was, 'Hi, Breonna, how are you? I'm such and such.' It was, 'Oh, you must be Breonna Taylor.' And with each one, I explained who she was..... It was just like this blank look. But it gave me an opportunity to teach. And so now, they know who Breonna Taylor is.\"\n\nBush, a 44-year-old native of St. Louis, pulled off a major upset in Missouri's 1 st Congressional District when, in August, she narrowly defeated ten-term incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in a Democratic primary. And Bush went on to win the general election on November 3, defeating Republican nominee Anthony Rogers by more than 60% ."

Lauren Boebert (R-CO) was outraged when the Democratic Ranking Member of a House Oversight subcommittee characterized the words of one of the GOP's witnesses as \"white supremacist.\"\n\nCongresswoman Boebert, who just days earlier at the right-wing CPAC event denounced diversity, equity, and inclusion , demanded two parliamentary inquiries, which did not give her the result she desired.\n\nCriticizing Republicans' choice for a witness, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) told the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs, \"One of these so-called energy experts is a philosopher who has previously espoused white supremacist views. For instance, in his 2000 college newspaper he wrote, 'the African and American Studies Department has 23 classes. In many of these classes, African culture is presented -\"\n\nBoebert interrupted.\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, I would like a parliamentary inquiry into taking down the gentle lady's words for insinuating that our witness made white supremacist statements,\" she said angrily, then adding, \"using his words.\"\n\n\"The Chair cannot take down words that are directed toward a witness, only to other members,\" the Chair replied.\n\nRanking Member Bush continued.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" Bush continued, beginning to quote the witness, \"'the African and African American Studies Department' - this is the quote - 'has 23 classes. In many of these classes. African culture is presented not as inferior to Western culture, but as on an equal footing with it in other departments. The same is done with Latin American, Indian, and American Indian culture.'\"\n\n\"When confronted about these views, over two decades later, rather than disavow them,\" Bush said. \"He doubled down on this narrative saying, 'it has nothing to do with skin color. I was arguing that those cultures overall are inferior to Western culture.' We are not inferior to any culture, speaking as a descendant of one of those cultures. This is the witness the Republicans invited to discuss issues of energy security. He came here to promote fossil fuels, which we know are disproportionately harming and killing black and brown people.\"\n\nRep. Bush then pointed to the two-sentence statement denouncing white supremacy and white nationalism which all 26 Republicans on the House Oversight Committee refused to sign .\n\n\"Last week, I joined Ranking Member Raskin and all of my Democratic Oversight colleagues in calling on Oversight Republicans to denounce white nationalism and denounce white supremacy in all its forms. Not one single Republican joined us. So I ask again today, will my Republican colleagues condemn white supremacy and work with us to ensure this Committee engages in advancing good and reducing harm rather than perpetuating it?\"\n\nWatch below or at this link ."

      "text": "'Discredited': Columnist explains why top Democrat's indictment actually hurts the GOP\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and his wife were recently indicted by the Department of Justice for allegedly taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes over a period of several years. However, one columnist is arguing that Cuellar's criminal charges are powerfully undermining a major Republican conspiracy theory.\n\nIn his latest op-ed for MSNBC , columnist Steve Benen wrote that the DOJ's prosecution of Cuellar - who is accused of accepting payments from a bank in Mexico City and an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan - complicates the GOP's claims of government being \"weaponized\" against them by President Joe Biden's administration. According to Benen, a weaponized DOJ wouldn't be going after a high-ranking elected member of Congress from its own party - particularly when control of the House of Representatives will come down to just a handful of seats nationwide.\n\n\"Republicans don't just want their conspiracy theory to be true; they need it to be true,\" Benen said. \"This simple, baseless idea is the foundation for the party's Trump defense, fundraising, stump speeches, cable news segments, and even legislative campaigns on Capitol Hill.\"\n\n\"In 2024, assertions about a 'two-tiered' justice system are foundational to GOP politics. They're also routinely discredited by real-world events,\" he continued. \"Indeed, if Biden and his team were trying to weaponize federal law enforcement to benefit Democrats, they've proved themselves to be incredibly bad at it.\"\n\nBenen's op-ed went on to explain how under Attorney General Merrick Garland's leadership, the DOJ has indicted other prominent Democrats on numerous felony charges, including Sen. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) and Hunter Biden . Garland's DOJ is also investigating other Democratic elected officials across the country like Rep. Cori Bush (D-Missouri) and New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n\"In advance of the 2018 elections, Donald Trump complained bitterly about federal law enforcement charging two of his congressional allies, and the then-president whined about the Justice Department undermining the Republican Party's electoral plans,\" Benen wrote.\n\n\"Six years later, federal law enforcement is prosecuting two Democratic members of Congress, potentially undermin[ing] their party's electoral plans, and Biden is taking a responsible, hands-off approach,\" he added.\n\nSince his indictment, Cuellar has stepped down from his position as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee. He has so far not indicated plans to resign from Congress.\n\n\"\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Cuellar stated . \"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\"\n\nCuellar, who is among the more conservative members of the House Democratic Caucus, narrowly survived a primary challenge from progressive activist Jessica Cisneros in 2022, winning by just a few hundred votes . His photo-finish victory may have been due to House Democratic leadership closing ranks around him amid Cisneros' attacks on Cuellar's anti-abortion record. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) praised Cuellar in 2022 even after the FBI raided his home.\n\n\"I support my incumbents,\" Pelosi said at the time. \"I support every one of them, from right to left. That is what I do.\""

Democrats who accept their money or endorsement should be shamed out of the party.\"\n\nInstitute on Race, Power, and Political Economy senior fellow Nina Turner , a former Democratic congressional candidate, declared , \"AIPAC is a right-wing group that buys deep blue seats.\"\n\nTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, drew a comparison to the National Rifle Association, saying , \"Imagine how mainstream Democrats would react if the NRA was the single biggest source of Republicans donating into Democratic primaries.\"\n\nSupport for or criticism of the Israeli government has become a defining issue in this election cycle over the past eight months, as Israel has waged a war on the Gaza Strip that has led to a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. AIPAC, which supports pro-Israel Democratic and Republican candidates, has targeted progressives who oppose the military assault.\n\n\"We are proud to engage in the democratic process in a bipartisan way to help elect candidates who support the U.S.-Israel relationship,\" AIPAC spokesperson Marshall Wittmann said in a statement. \"Candidates from both parties should welcome the engagement of pro-Israel activists because Americans overwhelmingly stand with the Jewish state. In fact, those who object to our participation only represent a small, extremist fringe.\"\n\nGallup polling released in March shows that 55% of Americans disapprove of Israeli military actions in Gaza-which as of Sunday, have killed over 37,000 people, according to local officials. A Pew Research Center survey published last week found that 53% of U.S. adults have little to no confidence that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will \"do the right thing regarding world affairs.\"\n\nPolitico put out the findings from its analysis-which is based on a review of Federal Election Commission filings from AIPAC, the ActBlue and WinRed donation platforms, and individual campaigns-a day after thousands of American critics of Israel's war and U.S. complicity in it descended on the White House while Israeli forces slaughtered hundreds more Palestinians.\n\nAccording to the outlet:\n\nThe top recipient of AIPAC money-at least $1.61 million-is Westchester County Executive George Latimer , who launched his challenge to Democratic Congressman Jamaal Bowman in New York's 16th Congressional District after visiting Israel.\n\nResponding to the report on social media Sunday, Bowman-who has called Israel's assault on Gaza genocide- said that \"Republicans are setting records spending against us. And we're going to break records beating them.\"\n\nPolitico pointed out that \"competitive Democratic primaries are also the biggest targets for AIPAC's affiliated super PAC, United Democracy Project, which has already spent $19.8 million in them this year, including $9.3 million in the Bowman-Latimer race. That makes it by far the biggest outside group in Democratic primaries, with more money flowing from UDP than the next 10 biggest spenders combined. (The super PAC has also spent in a handful of GOP primaries, dropping $3 million total.)\"\n\nThe New York arm of the Working Families Party, which is backing Bowman in the June 25 primary, shared Politico 's graph of top AIPAC beneficiaries and stressed that \"we must be united in rejecting AIPAC's efforts to subvert our democracy.\"\n\nAfter Bowman and two incumbents is St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, at $869,300. He is trying to oust another progressive \"Squad\" member, Democratic Congresswoman Cori Bush , in the August 6 primary for Missouri's 1st District.\n\n\"My opponent Wesley Bell is among AIPAC's TOP 4 recipients this cycle-and is gladly taking money from anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-labor, pro-NRA Republicans who expect his loyalty in return above all else,\" Bush said on social media. \"We deserve better. #StLouisIsNotForSale .\"\n\nFellow \"Squad\" member Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also weighed in, saying , \"Hmm it's almost like AIPAC functions as a political slush fund for Republican billionaires and should not have influence in the Democratic Party, let alone our primaries.\"\n\nPeople for Bernie-which was initially launched in support of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ' (I-Vt.) 2016 Democratic presidential campaign- said , \"Simply put: George Latimer in New York and Wesley Bell in Missouri are trying to become Democratic members of Congress off millions of dollars of money from rich right-wing Republicans.\"\n\nJustice Democrats, which worked to elect Bowman, Bush, and Ocasio-Cortez, asserted that reelecting the New York and Missouri progressives \"is a vote to #RejectAIPAC and Republican donors spending in our elections.\"\n\nThe group also noted Republican President Donald Trump , who is expected to face Democratic President Joe Biden in November. Justice Democrats said , \"Now that it's undeniable that AIPAC is *the* vehicle for Republican billionaires to spend in Democratic primaries, you have to ask what type of candidates would be willing to be bought and paid for by Trump donors?\""

Nebraska . Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina are suing the administration, alleging that its debt forgiveness plan violates the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers and Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nMOHELA is not even a plaintiff in the case, a fact that critics including progressive U.S. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) have cited in calling for the dismissal of the suit -one of two student debt relief cases the high court is expected to rule on sometime this month.\n\n\"These emails confirm what every honest observer has long understood: Missouri's lawsuit is just a partisan hack job aimed at getting the right-wing attorney general's name in the paper,\" Ella Azoulay, SBPC's research and policy analyst, said in a statement .\n\n\"MOHELA's own staff agree-the case currently before the Supreme Court that is holding up debt relief for tens of millions of borrowers lacks standing, and it should be tossed aside,\" Azoulay added.\n\n\"Just out of curiosity, is MOHELA apart [sic] of the lawsuit going on to prevent the loan forgiveness?\" wrote one employee in an email. \"Are we the bad guys?\"\n\nAnother staffer wrote that Schmitt's lawsuit \"has nothing to do with us, except that they're using the [Missouri] consumers harm as standing.\"\n\nIndeed, in an October 2022 letter to Bush-who had inquired about the lender's relationship with the attorney general's office-MOHELA said its \"executives were not involved in the decision\" by Schmitt to sue the Biden administration.\n\n\"I think MOHELA was opposed to this move, but couldn't do anything about it,\" wrote yet another staffer. \"The Mo. state AG needed to claim that our borrowers were harmed for standing, so they're making us look bad by filing this not only with Mo. on it, but especially bad because they filed it in Mo.\"\n\nDuring oral arguments in February, the Supreme Court's right-wing supermajority signaled it is poised to side with Republicans challenging the debt cancellation program and strike it down."

Each and every day, their role in U.S. politics becomes a greater scandal. They are the NRA of foreign policy. Of course they don't want a cease-fire.\"\n\nThe other lawmakers targeted by AIPAC were Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman (N.Y.), Cori Bush (Mo.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Mark Pocan (Wis.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), the only Palestinian American in Congress.\n\n\"I'm starting to think that AIPAC isn't just a puppet of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, but a partner,\" said Pocan. \"They cover for his murdering of innocents in the course of supposedly going after Hamas and those actions aren't getting hostages released. They seem fine with that and don't mind the killing of kids.\"\n\nIn less than five months, Israel's blockade and bombardment of Gaza have killed at least 29,313 Palestinians and devastated civilian infrastructure, displacing the vast majority of the Hamas-governed enclave's 2.3 million residents.\n\nBefore October 7, the United States already gave Israel nearly $4 billion in annual military aid. The Biden administration has responded to the war by seeking a package worth over $14 billion, bypassing federal lawmakers to arm Israeli forces, and defending Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories at the ICJ on Wednesday.\n\nAIPAC, meanwhile, has worked to oust progressive members of Congress in the November election. The group is also fighting growing global allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and demands for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages taken on October 7 as well as Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.\n\n\"A cease-fire means Palestinians will not be slaughtered by Israel every day. A cease-fire means medicine and food. A cease-fire means hostages come home,\" Jewish Voice for Peace political director Beth Miller said of the group's social media post. \"AIPAC wants a total genocide of Palestinians, with full funding from the U.S. AIPAC wants death and destruction. That's it.\"\n\nOrganizer Melissa Byrne accused AIPAC of \"exploiting sexual violence to keep a war going,\" adding that the group \"prefers war to freeing the hostages and security for Israel and Palestine .\""

(Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP, File)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - A deep-pocketed pro-Israel super PAC that helped defeat one member of the congressional group known as the Squad is now pushing to oust another - Missouri Democrat Cori Bush.\n\nBush, of St. Louis, has been a vocal critic of how Israel responded when attacked by Hamas in October, calling the Israeli retaliation an \"ethnic cleansing campaign,\" and she was among the few House members who opposed a resolution supporting Israel . She boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress last week, calling him a \"war criminal.\"\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee's super political action committee, United Democracy Project, has spent more than $8.4 million to unseat Bush in her Aug. 6 Democratic primary against St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\n\"AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell,\" an AIPAC statement to The Associated Press read. \"Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.\"\n\nThe race points yet again to the complications the war in Gaza has caused for Democrats in this year's elections, with core constituencies at odds over how President Joe Biden's administration has responded. The disagreement has implications up and down the ballot and has already cost one incumbent his seat. United Democracy Project spent nearly $15 million against progressive U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, one of the most vocal critics of the Israeli government in the House, in a June primary election he lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist in New York.\n\nAfterward, AIPAC said the \"outcome in this race once again shows that the pro-Israel position is both good policy and good politics - for both parties.\"\n\nBush, in an interview, said the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Bush said. \"Because if they can unseat me, then they're going to continue to come after more Democrats.\"\n\nDespite the onslaught of money, Bush said she is confident she has the support of St. Louis voters.\n\n\"They know that I've had this same belief, this pro-peace, pro-democracy, pro-diplomacy, anti-war, pro-humanity - I've been this person all along,\" Bush said.\n\nSoon after the Hamas attack of Israel, Bush wrote on social media that Israel's \"collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas's actions is a war crime.\"\n\n\"I strongly condemn Hamas & their appalling violations of human rights,\" she wrote, \"but violations of human rights don't justify more human rights violations in retaliation.\"\n\nHer comments prompted backlash , even among some supporters in her district. Not long after that, Bell announced he was dropping his plans to run for the Senate against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley to instead challenge Bush in the congressional primary.\n\nBell, like Bush, is Black and was active in Ferguson, Missouri, after Black 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, a shooting that helped launch the national Black Lives Matter movement. After being elected prosecutor in 2018, Bell reopened an examination of Brown's death but found no grounds to charge the officer , Darren Wilson.\n\nBell, in an interview, said Bush's comments about Israel were \"wrong and offensive.\"\n\n\"She has accused the people who have been the target of genocide and ethnic cleansing of doing that, which was just wrong,\" Bell said. \"Israel was attacked on Oct. 7 by a terror state. They didn't attack military targets. They attacked (people) at a concert. They attacked women, seniors, children, killed babies.\"\n\nBell said the goal should be to work toward a \"peaceful resolution\" in the Middle East.\n\n\"We don't want to see any innocent Palestinians, any innocent Israelis, harmed. We want to keep the door open to a two-state solution,\" he said.\n\nAIPAC isn't alone in seeking Bush's ouster. DMFI PAC, which supports pro-Israeli Democrats, is funding TV ads supporting Bell and Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat running in the primary to replace Rep. Ruben Gallego.\n\nConversely, nearly two dozen progressive groups have come together to support Bush and other Squad members. The coalition, called Reject AIPAC, includes Jewish peace organizations and Arab American and Muslim groups that have been organizing since the Israel-Hamas war began.\n\nOne group that is part of Reject AIPAC, Justice Democrats, has spent around $1.5 million on behalf of Bush in the primary cycle. Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi called AIPAC's record spending in the New York race \"an all-out assault on our Democracy\" that was being repeated in Missouri.\n\n\"Are we willing to let super PACs and lobbies, no matter what interests they represent, purchase elections and congressional seats just because they have more money?\" Andrabi asked. \"Or are we going to build a Democratic Party that actually reflects the needs and interests of everyday people?\"\n\nBush also is getting moral support from several key Democratic congressional leaders. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark and Caucus Chair Rep. Pete Aguilar are among those who have endorsed Bush.\n\nBut the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has stayed out of the Missouri race, with no contributions listed for either Bush or Bell.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Christian Gooden/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell has defeated U.S. Rep. Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St. Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party's incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nBush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the \"Squad,\" was seeking a third term in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which includes St. Louis city and part of St. Louis County. Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the U.S. House.\n\n\"I am committed to serving the St. Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication,\" Bell said in a statement. \"Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\n\nBush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she'll no longer be in Congress.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whether I'm a congresswoman or not, I'm still taking care of my people,\" Bush said.\n\nBell's campaign received a big boost from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose super political action committee, United Democracy Project, spent $8.5 million to oust Bush. She was targeted after repeated criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack .\n\nIt was a gameplan that worked earlier this year in New York. In June, United Democracy Project spent $15 million to defeat another Squad member - U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman. Bowman lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist.\n\nA statement from United Democracy Project said the wins by Bell and Latimer, along with John McGuire's defeat of U.S. Rep. Bob Good in a Republican primary last week in Virginia, \"is further proof that being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics on both sides of the aisle. UDP will continue our efforts to support leaders working to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance while countering detractors in either political party.\"\n\nBush, in her concession speech, said she won't change.\n\n\"We will keep supporting a free Palestine,\" Bush said. A crowd member answered back: \"Free, free Palestine.\"\n\nIn October, Bush called the Israeli retaliation an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\" Soon after the Hamas attack, Bush wrote on social media that Israel's \"collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas's actions is a war crime.\"\n\nHer comments prompted backlash , even among some supporters in her district. Bell, who had been planning a Senate run against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley, instead opted to challenge Bush. He told The Associated Press last month that Bush's comments about Israel were \"wrong and offensive.\"\n\nBush responded by saying that the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Bush told the AP. \"Because if they can unseat me, then they're going to continue to come after more Democrats.\"\n\nBush and Bell both honed their leadership skills in Ferguson, Missouri, in the unrest that followed Michael Brown's death at the hands of a police officer in 2014. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of Brown's death.\n\nBrown, a Black 18-year-old, was walking with a friend on Aug. 9, 2014, when a white officer, Darren Wilson, confronted them. Wilson said he fired in self-defense because Brown was so enraged. Some witnesses said Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands up in surrender. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned, and Brown's death led to months of protests.\n\nBush, 48, became a protest leader. She was outspoken and critical of how police in Ferguson and other parts of the St. Louis region treated Black people. Her activism prompted an unsuccessful run against longtime incumbent 1st District Democrat William Lacy Clay in 2018, before she defeated him in 2020. She easily won reelection in 2022.\n\nBell, 49, began hosting conversations about community policing after Brown's death. The lawyer, who previously served as a municipal prosecutor and judge, ran successfully for a seat on the Ferguson City Council before defeating seven-term incumbent St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch in the August 2018 Democratic primary.\n\nAs prosecutor, Bell reopened an examination into Brown's death. He announced in July 2020 that while the investigation didn't exonerate Wilson, there wasn't enough evidence to charge him.\n\n\"My heart breaks\" for Brown's parents, Bell said at the time. \"I know this is not the result they were looking for and that their pain will continue forever.\"\n\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., was featured in an ad for Bush.\n\n\"He used my family for power,\" Brown says of Bell in the ad. \"And now he's trying to sell out St. Louis.\"\n\nBush's campaign focused on what she's accomplished for St. Louis. She said her efforts have brought $2 billion to the 1st District and that it was her protest on the steps of the Capitol in 2021 that helped extend the federal eviction moratorium as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding thousands of St. Louisans.\n\nBell touted his own progressive credentials. He noted that as a prosecutor he has said he will not prosecute any abortion cases in a state that bans the procedure in most instances. He created diversion programs to point people with mental health and substance abuse problems toward treatment instead of jail. And his office has expanded efforts to examine potential cases of wrongful convictions.\n\nIn Missouri's 3rd District, which stretches from the western outskirts of the St. Louis region through central Missouri, the candidate with Trump's endorsement won. Bob Onder, a physician and also a former state senator, defeated former state Sen. Kurt Schaefer.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social last month that Onder was \"an incredible America First Patriot.\" The former president wrote that Schaefer \"is WEAK ON MAGA,\" adding, \"That's all you have to know!\"\n\nThe 3rd District is heavily Republican, and Onder will be favored against Democrat Bethany Mann, a political newcomer, in November. ___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that Onder won in Missouri's 3rd District, not Schaefer\n\n___\n\nSummer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department is investigating whether Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri misused campaign funds for her personal security, the progressive lawmaker confirmed in a statement Tuesday.\n\nBush, a second-term lawmaker, denied any wrongdoing and said she is \"fully cooperating\" with federal prosecutors.\n\n\"As a rank-and-file member of Congress I am not entitled to personal protection by the House, and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services,\" Bush said. \"I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services.\"\n\nHer statement came a day after the Justice Department subpoenaed the office of the House Sergeant at Arms for related documents. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nSince being elected to the House in 2021, Bush, a Black woman with activist roots , has been the target of right-wing attacks . As a result, she has spent a substantial amount of money on private security while she's on Capitol Hill and back home in her district in St. Louis.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been asking questions about Bush's security expenses, the threats she received and her decision to pay her now-husband Cortney Merritts with campaign funds to provide security, a person familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. The questions have been similar to those asked by congressional investigators conducting an ethics inquiry, the person said. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe issue of how Bush has been funding her security is currently under investigation by the Federal Election Commission and the House Committee on Ethics. The FEC has stated that it is not technically against the rules for a member of Congress to use campaign funds for private security as there has been a striking increase of violent threats against lawmakers in recent years. The Office of Congressional Ethics unanimously determined in October to clear Bush of any wrongdoing in their investigation.\n\n\"I look forward to this same outcome from all pending investigations,\" Bush said Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm going to make sure I have security because I know I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do,\" the former Black Lives Matter activist told CBS News in August 2021. \"So, if I end up spending $200,000, if I spend ... 10 more dollars on it, you know what? I get to be here to do the work.\n\nA spokesperson for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that Bush is entitled to the presumption of innocence as the investigation moves forward.\n\n\"It is our expectation that the investigation will follow the facts, apply the law and be conducted in a professional manner,\" Christie Stephenson said.\n\nPunchbowl News first reported the news about the investigation into Bush.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Mike Balsamo and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File)\n\n▶ Follow the AP's live coverage of the 2024 election\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The \"Squad,\" a group of progressive lawmakers in the House, is set to shrink next year after two members suffered primary defeats this election cycle following an unprecedented deluge of special interest spending.\n\nThe primary losses for Reps. Cori Bush in Missouri and Jamaal Bowman in New York came over the summer and dealt a blow to the progressive faction, which had amassed considerable clout within the Democratic Party since its initial rise in 2018.\n\nThe cohort of Black and brown lawmakers - including Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Summer Lee of Pennsylvania - became the target of pro-Israel PACs like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC , late last year after members criticized Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. Eight months later, AIPAC's super political action committee, United Democracy Project, helped unseat Bush and Bowman after pouring nearly $25 million combined into those races.\n\nStill, there were other factors that contributed to the defeat of Bush and Bowman beyond their position Israel, raising questions as to what extent voters rejected their progressive politics.\n\nAnother member of the Squad, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, easily won her primary Tuesday against a repeat challenger despite voting similarly to Bush and Bowman over the last two years and being a vocal critic of Israel.\n\nHere's how the three Democratic primary races played out:\n\nBowman was particularly vulnerable this election cycle because of redistricting.\n\nThe new map of his the district eliminated most sections of the Bronx and added more of Westchester County's suburbs, greatly narrowing the number of Black voters who were key to Bowman's reelection effort.\n\nThen Bowman drew a strong challenger in well-known county executive George Latimer, a centrist with more than three decades of political experience in the Westchester area.\n\nLatimer entered the race with the support of Jewish leaders in the district who were upset with Bowman's critical stance on Israel. He also enjoyed hefty financial backing from AIPAC's super PAC, which poured about $15 million in the race to support him.\n\nThe contest was largely shaped by Bowman's position on Israel. Latimer hammered the incumbent as more focused on Israel than the needs of the district. Latimer also flexed his deep regional knowledge to make the case to voters that he could would be a more effective member of Congress.\n\nBowman, who was seeking a third term, also had to fend off persistent criticism over triggering a fire alarm in a House building while lawmakers were working on a funding bill. He said it was unintentional, but the incident drew waves of embarrassing coverage and he was censured by the House for his actions.\n\nThe focus of campaign ads against Bush in the final weeks before her August primary against St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell was not her scathing criticism of Israel or its leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, but instead a vote that she and five of her Squad colleagues took in late 2021.\n\nUnited Democracy Project, which spent more than $8.4 million against Bush, began airing ads in the local media market that highlighted the 48-year-old's vote against a bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by President Joe Biden and supported by the majority of the Democrats in Congress.\n\n\"This infrastructure bill that Joe Biden passed has been so good for working people in St. Louis,\" one voter said during the 30-second ad. \"Cori Bush voted against it.\" Another added, \"She voted against our jobs.\"\n\nBush, Bowman, Omar and other progressives defended their vote against the bill at the time, saying it was a necessary stance as they fought for passage of a separate social and environmental package. But their vote on the bill only became a campaign issue for Bush.\n\nAllies of Bush say the campaign to defeat her wouldn't have been possible had Bell not had the support of outside groups like UDP, which spent more than $400,000 to air the half-minute spot, according to data from the media tracking firm AdImpact.\n\n\"If you asked any any voter in any of these districts at the start of this cycle, 'Do you know how your member of Congress voted on the infrastructure bill?' no one would say yes,\" Usamah Andrabi, a spokesman for the progressive Justice Democrats, told The Associated Press. \"No one was thinking about a vote that happened three years ago for a bill that passed.\"\n\nBeyond her legislative record, Bush faced a series of public and personal scandals of her own in the last few years, including an ongoing Justice Department investigation into her campaign spending.\n\nOmar managed to avoid the fate of her two fellow Squad members and had several things going in her favor. First, the African-born congresswoman, who has broken many firsts since being elected to the House in 2018, had the advantage during her primary Tuesday of having previously defeated her challenger.\n\nIn 2022, former Minneapolis city councilman Don Samuels came just two percentage points short of beating Omar with the help of UDP, which spent six figures in the race. This time around, the third-term lawmaker took the threat posed by Samuels and a potential influx of AIPAC money much more seriously.\n\n\"I think the congresswoman and her team understood that there needed to be a lot of work to remind people in that district about what type of leadership she brought,\" Andrabi said. \"And I think she exemplified that.\"\n\nOmar also raised a lot more money for the primary, with her campaign reporting that it raised around $6.2 million. Samuels, on the other hand, raised about $1.4 million.\n\n\"What I was hoping is that a strong ground game and an attention to the details of folks who felt left out would trump an overwhelming superiority in dollars,\" Samuels said in a recent AP interview. \"Clearly money matters a little more in politics than I had hoped.\"\n\nOmar's substantial fundraising advantage, coupled with the endorsements of Minnesota's Democratic Party and progressive leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, helped her win by nearly 14 points.\n\nAnd possibly the most important factor in her race was that groups like AIPAC ultimately didn't get involved despite threatening to unseat any candidate they deemed insufficiently pro-Israel.\n\n___ Izaguirre reported from New York.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Cori Bush went from helping to lead an informal movement for racial justice to winning two terms as a congresswoman from Missouri, with an office decorated with photographs of families who lost loved ones to police violence. One is of Michael Brown.\n\nBrown's death 10 years ago in Ferguson, Missouri, was a defining moment for America's racial justice movement . It cast a global spotlight on longtime demands for reforms to systems subjecting millions of people to everything from economic discrimination to murder.\n\nActivists like Bush went from proclaiming \"Black Lives Matter\" to running for seats in statehouses, city halls, prosecutors' offices and Congress - and winning. Local legislation has been passed to do everything from dismantling prisons and jails and reforming schools to eliminating hair discrimination .\n\nRep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., speaks to an Associated Press reporter in her office at Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nAt least 30 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws meant to curb abusive conduct since 2020, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. While the last decade of racial justice activism transformed politics, landmark reforms remain elusive, more than three dozen activists, elected officials and political operatives told The Associated Press.\n\n\"As we look at the strides we've made, it ebbs and flows,\" said Bush, a longtime community organizer and pastor before becoming a Democratic representative. \"We're still dealing with militarized policing in communities. We're still dealing with the police shootings.\"\n\nFILE - Protesters appeal to motorists for support while rallying on Aug. 11, 2014 in front of the QT gas station in Ferguson, Mo. that was looted and burned during rioting overnight that followed a candlelight vigil honoring 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot on Aug. 9, 2014 by Ferguson police officers. (AP Photo/Sid Hastings)\n\nAs the new generation of Black activists wielding cellphones rewrote the national conversation on policing, questions of public safety and racial justice pushed into the center of American politics. Police body cameras are widespread. Tactics including chokeholds have been outlawed.\n\nFerguson prompted a change in how communities tackle police reform and misconduct, said Svante Myrick, who was the youngest-ever mayor of Ithaca, New York, from 2011 to 2021 before becoming president for People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy group.\n\nAt least 150 reforms passed in localities and states.\n\nFILE - People defy a curfew on Aug. 17, 2014, before tear gas was fired to disperse a crowd protesting the shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\n\"I know that someone's life was saved, that there was an officer, that there was an encounter where a police officer could have made a different decision had there not been 400 days of protest during the Ferguson uprising,\" Bush said. \"Maybe the world was waking up to the fact that it can't just be an outside strategy, there has to be an inside strategy as well.\"\n\nFILE - Tishaura Jones speaks during a news conference on Aug. 5, 2020, in St. Louis. The first Black woman to lead the city of St. Louis has worked to end its \"arrest and incarcerate\" model of policing and place more emphasis on social service programs to help the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates.(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nAn example is Tishaura Jones, the first Black woman to lead St. Louis, who's worked to end the city's \"arrest and incarcerate\" model of policing and emphasize social service programs to help neighborhoods with high crime rates.\n\nA new generation of leaders is putting that pattern into play nationwide.\n\n\"I'm someone that entered politics through the Black Lives Matter movement after years of witnessing unfair killings against Black and brown people,\" said Chi Ossé, a 26-year-old member of the New York City Council.\n\nHe used social media to organize protests after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd , who was Black, in 2020, sparking a new and massive wave of protests. \"It's resulted in me having a different type of leadership style within my own community than prior City Council members who have represented this district.\"\n\nLawmakers in Washington were wary of the Black Lives Matter movement at first.\n\nIn 2015, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told three Black Lives Matter activists they should focus on changing laws instead of hearts. A 2016 memo from the Democratic Party's House campaign arm told politicians to limit the number of Black Lives Matter activists at public events, or meet privately.\n\nFerguson marked a new phase. For perhaps the first time, a visible mass protest movement for justice for a single victim was born organically - not convened by clergy members or centered in the church - and often linked by mobile phones and sustained by hip-hop .\n\nBrown's death and the treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters also led many Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders to an internal reckoning . Organizations and individuals of all ages were galvanized to get off the sidelines.\n\n\"We've had gains,\" Bush said. \"I wanted to bring the movement into the House of Representatives, and I feel that I've been able to do that.\"\n\nBy 2015, Ferguson activists were welcomed into the White House to work on the Obama administration's Task Force for 21st Century Policing .\n\nWhile Donald Trump embraced some criminal justice reforms like the First Step Act , he remained opposed to racial justice activists throughout his administration. The movement was met with scorn on the right. In 2016, the then-Republican presidential nominee called Black Lives Matter \"divisive\" and blamed President Barack Obama for worsening race relations nationwide.\n\nTrump was president during the racial justice protests that emerged in the summer of 2020 following Floyd's killing. During protests, he posted , \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" He signed an executive order encouraging better police practices but that was criticized for failing to acknowledge what some consider systemic racial bias in policing.\n\nDuring a 2017 speech in New York , Trump appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding handcuffed suspects' heads as they're placed in patrol cars.\n\nTrump's election caused many racial justice activists to shift focus from individual police departments to how federal policies fund and protect police misconduct.\n\nFILE - A protester carries a U.S. flag upside down, a sign of distress, next to a burning building on May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)\n\nThe movement was again thrust into politics when Chauvin murdered Floyd in May 2020.\n\nThe protests upended American politics and shocked even many who′d spent years advocating for policies that were suddenly in the mainstream - community response teams, restrictions on police tactics, redirecting police funding.\n\nFloyd's relatives appeared at the 2020 Democratic National Convention; the following year, Democrats introduced a bill that would've enacted sweeping reforms.\n\nFILE - Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct, on May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nThe George Floyd Justice In Policing Act would have banned chokeholds and no-knock warrants, like the one that led to Louisville police killing Breonna Taylor in her home. It also would have created a database listing officers disciplined for gross misconduct.\n\nThe House passed it in 2021. The Senate failed to reach a consensus.\n\nElla Jones didn′t see herself running for office before the Ferguson protests. A minister and entrepreneur, Jones felt called to protest Brown's killing but said local Democratic leaders told her to run for Ferguson mayor. She won a City Council seat, and was eventually elected mayor.\n\n\"You can stand outside and scream at the system. However, you must be at the table where policy is made,\" Jones said. \"Some people may go into politics. Some people may go into establishing nonprofits, but it's going to take all of us working together to make the change.\n\n′′You have to be at the table, where policy is made.\"\n\nFerguson's prosecuting attorney, Wesley Bell, was on a promise to tackle police misconduct.\n\nFILE - In this July 29, 2019 file photo, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell speaks during an interview in Clayton, Mo. Bell announced on Oct. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, file)\n\nBell said in 2020 that legislators need to look hard at laws that offer police officers protection against prosecution that regular citizens aren't afforded.\n\n\"It is something that handcuffs prosecutors in numerous ways when you are going about prosecuting officers who have committed unlawful use of force or police shootings,\" Bell said.\n\nIn August he defeated Bush in a bitter Democratic U.S. House primary.\n\nBush said she doesn't know what she′ll do after leaving Congress.\n\n\"But the fight is still here, and my boots aren't far from me,\" she said. \"So people probably should have wondered, is she more dangerous in Congress or outside of it?\"\n\nRep.

William Lacy Clay Tuesday in Missouri's Democratic primary, ending a political dynasty that has spanned more than a half-century.\n\nBush's victory came in a rematch of 2018, when she failed to capitalize on a national Democratic wave that favored political newcomers such as Bush's friend, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBut this time around, Bush's supporters said protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis and outrage over racial injustice finally pushed her over the edge.\n\nAn emotional Bush, speaking to supporters while wearing a mask, said few people expected her to win.\n\n\"They counted us out,\" she said. \"They called me - I'm just the protester, I'm just the activist with no name, no title and no real money. That's all they said that I was. But St. Louis showed up today.\"\n\nBush's campaign spokeswoman, Keenan Korth, said voters in the district were \"galvanized.\"\n\n\"They're ready to turn the page on decades of failed leadership,\" Korth said.\n\nBush, 44, also had backing from political action committee Justice Democrats and Fight Corporate Monopolies this election. She campaigned for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during his presidential bid.\n\nBush's primary win essentially guarantees her a seat in Congress representing the heavily Democratic St. Louis area. Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses Ferguson, has been represented by Clay or his father for a half-century. Bill Clay served 32 years before retiring in 2000. William Lacy Clay, 64, was elected that year.\n\nClay didn't face a serious challenger until Bush. This year, he ran on his decades-long record in Congress.\n\n\"This election is a simple choice,\" Clay said in a Monday statement. \"Cori Bush's Empty Rhetoric, or my record of real results and real reforms for the people.\"\n\nBoth Clay and Bush are Black, and Black residents slightly outnumber whites in the district that includes St. Louis and north St. Louis County.\n\nBush became ill while pregnant with her second child in 2001 and had to quit her job at a preschool. When she and her then-husband were evicted from a rental home, the couple, their newborn and 14-month-old son lived out of a Ford Explorer for several months.\n\nEventually, the couple divorced. Bush earned a nursing degree. She also became a pastor.\n\nMichael Brown's death in 2014 in Ferguson vaulted her into another role: activist. She became a leader of some of the many protests that followed the fatal police shooting of the Black, unarmed 18-year-old. She was back on the streets in 2017 after a white St. Louis officer was acquitted in the shooting death of a Black suspect.\n\nShe continues to lead protests.\n\n\"She's being buoyed by this movement, and the movement's origin is in Ferguson,\" Justice Democrats spokesman Waleed Shahid said.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Sara Burnett contributed to this report from Chicago.

LOUIS (AP) - A deep-pocketed pro-Israel super PAC that helped defeat one member of the congressional group known as the Squad is now pushing to oust another - Missouri Democrat Cori Bush.\n\nBush, of St. Louis, has been a vocal critic of how Israel responded when attacked by Hamas in October, calling the Israeli retaliation an \"ethnic cleansing campaign,\" and she was among the few House members who opposed a resolution supporting Israel . She boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress last week, calling him a \"war criminal.\"\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee's super political action committee, United Democracy Project, has spent more than $8.4 million to unseat Bush in her Aug. 6 Democratic primary against St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\n\"AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell,\" an AIPAC statement to The Associated Press read. \"Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.\"\n\nThe race points yet again to the complications the war in Gaza has caused for Democrats in this year's elections, with core constituencies at odds over how President Joe Biden's administration has responded. The disagreement has implications up and down the ballot and has already cost one incumbent his seat. United Democracy Project spent nearly $15 million against progressive U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, one of the most vocal critics of the Israeli government in the House, in a June primary election he lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist in New York.\n\nAfterward, AIPAC said the \"outcome in this race once again shows that the pro-Israel position is both good policy and good politics - for both parties.\"\n\nBush, in an interview, said the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Bush said. \"Because if they can unseat me, then they're going to continue to come after more Democrats.\"\n\nDespite the onslaught of money, Bush said she is confident she has the support of St. Louis voters.\n\n\"They know that I've had this same belief, this pro-peace, pro-democracy, pro-diplomacy, anti-war, pro-humanity - I've been this person all along,\" Bush said.\n\nSoon after the Hamas attack of Israel, Bush wrote on social media that Israel's \"collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas's actions is a war crime.\"\n\n\"I strongly condemn Hamas & their appalling violations of human rights,\" she wrote, \"but violations of human rights don't justify more human rights violations in retaliation.\"\n\nHer comments prompted backlash , even among some supporters in her district. Not long after that, Bell announced he was dropping his plans to run for the Senate against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley to instead challenge Bush in the congressional primary.\n\nBell, like Bush, is Black and was active in Ferguson, Missouri, after Black 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, a shooting that helped launch the national Black Lives Matter movement. After being elected prosecutor in 2018, Bell reopened an examination of Brown's death but found no grounds to charge the officer , Darren Wilson.\n\nBell, in an interview, said Bush's comments about Israel were \"wrong and offensive.\"\n\n\"She has accused the people who have been the target of genocide and ethnic cleansing of doing that, which was just wrong,\" Bell said. \"Israel was attacked on Oct. 7 by a terror state. They didn't attack military targets. They attacked (people) at a concert.

      "text": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Self-Limiting Revolution\n\nKnock Down the House set out to show an inspiring political movement-but instead revealed its boundaries.\n\nThe final image of Knock Down the House , the hit documentary about a quartet of 2018 congressional primary candidates, shows Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her boyfriend newly arrived at the east plaza of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. She has just been elected to Congress, but not yet taken office. They both start to cry; the waterworks run at a low gurgle throughout the movie, and at this point the viewer won't be alarmed by another eruption.\n\nSuddenly scooters appear, and the couple, with infectious delight, takes off in zigzags across the plaza, which is usually closed to tourists. The image thus combines three elements-Millennials, scooters, and trespassing-that seem designed to make a certain kind of conservative Republican's head explode. The poor fellow will probably view the film as an exercise in trolling, a giddy, unapologetic version of his worst nightmare.\n\nBut it takes two to troll. Most viewers will be intrigued rather than annoyed by Knock Down the House ; some will be inspired. The filmmakers, the wife-and-husband team of Rachel Lears and Robin Blotnick, set out to record a political movement at the moment of its creation, and there's no mistaking the uplift implied by their final shot: Let the word go forth, from this time and content provider (Netflix), that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, come of age in this century, tempered by two wars, disciplined by piles of student-loan debt, proud of their multicultural heritages. And they will be arriving on scooters.\n\nThat's the message of the movie, anyway, and it's perfectly tailored to invigorate a political culture dazed with Trump fatigue. Whether Lears and Blotnick make a persuasive case is another question.\n\nAlong with Ocasio-Cortez, the movie follows three other political newcomers. All were recruited by two loosely organized groups, Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, made up of veterans of Bernie Sanders's 2016 campaign.\n\nPaula Jean Swearengin of West Virginia was persuaded to undertake a primary challenge to an incumbent Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, in hopes of making West Virginia into something a little less like West Virginia-less coal and more jobs, for starters. Cori Bush, a nurse in St. Louis whose work schedule sometimes forced her to campaign in scrubs, tried to unseat her local representative, also a Democrat, after the police shooting of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. And Amy Vilela, who blames the untimely death of her daughter on the health-care industry, quit her job as a business executive to run for an open congressional seat in Las Vegas.\n\nOnly Ocasio-Cortez made it past the primaries. Batting .250 is middling in baseball and even less impressive in politics. The survival rate suggests that the movement may not be quite as robust as the candidates and the activists who enlisted them hope.\n\n\"It's not about any of us individually,\" Vilela says on the night of her defeat, tearful but still game. \"It's about the whole movement.\" Ocasio-Cortez replies that it may take a hundred women running against the establishment for each one who breaks through into the halls of power-easy for her to say, of course, since she's the one and not the hypothetical 99. Still, politics, like baseball, is an enterprise for unbending optimists, and you can't help but be impressed by the energy and pluck the candidates summon in fighting their uphill battles.\n\nThe viewers' simple admiration for the tenacity and optimism that politics requires might extend to the candidates' entrenched opponents, too, but we never really get a good look at them. The exception is Ocasio-Cortez's target, Representative Joseph Crowley. At the time of his gibbeting, Crowley was the fourth-ranking member of the House Democratic leadership. Pink and fleshy, with a toothy perma-grin, he could have been drawn by Thomas Nast to represent the Machine Hack, the very symbol of complacent incumbent. He saw Ocasio-Cortez coming too late and never knew what hit him.\n\nThe film leaves it unclear what Crowley's offense was, why he deserved his unhorsing-beyond being one of the world's seemingly bottomless supply of \"white dudes in suits,\" to use the phrase of one activist in Knock Down the House . (It's the filmmakers' bad luck that they never caught him wearing a suit.) As a liberal Democrat, he sat in the middle of his caucus ideologically-no Barbara Lee or Jamie Raskin, but a reliable \"yes\" vote on whatever enthusiasm public-employee unions and environmentalists placed before him.\n\nCrowley initially avoided a debate with Ocasio-Cortez but at last relented. She tagged him for living in suburban Virginia rather than his district, as so many congressional lifers do, and for sending his children to school in their neighborhood rather than to the diploma mills back home (ditto). Crowley, she charged, helped defeat an obscure amendment to the Dodd-Frank bank-regulation bill; the amendment would have helped \"working families,\" Ocasio-Cortez assures us. And although Crowley did his duty and called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \"fascist,\" he refused to join Ocasio-Cortez in her demand that the agency be abolished.\n\n\"If you think this system is fascist,\" she said to Crowley, \"then why don't you vote to eliminate it?\"\n\nHe had no answer. That's how you know when a congressman has been in Washington too long: He loses the courage of his own demagoguery.\n\nIn all this, Ocasio-Cortez demonstrates campaign skills of a high order. She walks away with the movie, and not only because she's the only winner. She's quick on her feet, strategically alert, and absolutely sure of what she thinks, with an eye for her opponent's jugular and a circulatory system that by all indications functions on pure ice water. A brief interlude in which she dissects one of Crowley's multipage, full-color mailers-\"this Victoria's Secret catalog,\" she calls it-is a master class in how incumbents like Crowley misread their own voters while still managing to make political consultants fabulously rich. Her use of social media shows perfect demographic pitch: agitprop, recipes, civics lessons, life affirmations like \"You can grow through your imperfections,\" jumbled together and running nonstop, make her Instagram and Twitter feeds endlessly informative and enjoyable. She's Tony Robbins, Suze Orman, and Saul Alinsky, all in one.\n\nAnother hundred iterations of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, working as both candidate and consultant, and her movement would be an irresistible electoral force-assuming the nation at large suddenly took on the political characteristics of her district in the Bronx and Queens. You'd never know it from the movie, but 2018 was a banner year for Democrats. They took back the House of Representatives by winning swing districts much redder than the solidly Democratic areas in which the Knock Down the House candidates ran (and mostly lost). Of the three congressional districts, only Vilela's is home to a substantial number of Republicans.\n\nAs a piece of filmmaking, Knock Down the House is kind of a mess. In trying to track four different candidates in four different districts on four different timelines, Lears and Blotnick set themselves a high bar for narrative coherence that they are unable to clear. Important turning points come and go, on camera and off, without much explanation. Who, you sometimes wonder, is recruiting whom? The muddle works to confuse the larger themes. We never learn what this new movement exists to do, aside from offering liberal Democrats the chance to end the careers of slightly less liberal Democrats.\n\n\"We don't care about party,\" one activist says at the beginning of the movie. \"We just want to get stuff done.\" But political parties exist precisely because, according to 200 years of experience, they are the most efficient way to get stuff done. \"It doesn't matter if you're Republican or Democrat,\" says another. Well, yes, it does, actually. There is much talk of diversity in Knock Down the House , and the candidates and activists are indeed diverse in the predictable ways: They run the gamut of body type, from endo- to ectomorph, of regional accent, of ethnicity, of class background. But when it comes to politics-Medicare for All or a universal job guarantee-they are ideologically uniform. You'll find more diversity of views in the locker room of the Burning Tree Club than in a recruiting session for Justice Democrats.\n\nThat's why it's a movement. But movements only succeed when they transcend themselves. \"It's time for everyday Americans to be represented by everyday Americans,\" declares Ocasio-Cortez, the world's most famous ex-bartender, not realizing that the minute she beat Joe Crowley she ceased to be an everyday American. The sooner she recognizes that she has now taken a place in the larger, much-loathed system, with all its demands of moderation and compromise, the greater the chances that she and her colleagues will become something more effective than a movement batting .250.\n\nUntil then, those Republicans whose heads explode at the mere sight of Ocasio-Cortez-and there are lots of them-can glue the skull fragments back in place. They have less to worry about than they think."

      "text": "The McCloskeys' Unsubtle Message to White America\n\nMark and Patricia McCloskey appeared at the Republican National Convention to warn that Democrats want to \"abolish the suburbs.\" Their vision of America is premised on fear-and dominating others.\n\nP atricia and Mark McCloskey sat close together on their burnt-red scalloped couch, the dark wood-paneled walls behind them teasing the grandeur of their St. Louis home, which has been decorated with French silk damask wall coverings, classical-style ceiling murals, and marble urns depicting the Roman god Neptune out front. In June, the pair stood on their lawn, barefoot in slacks, beside carefully curated shrubbery, waving a pistol and an AR-15-style rifle at Black Lives Matter protesters who were headed toward the mayor's house. The standoff made national news-and earned the couple an invitation to speak at this week's Republican National Convention. \"Make no mistake,\" Patricia McCloskey told viewers last night, \"no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats' America.\"\n\nThe McCloskeys didn't talk about race explicitly, but racial fear was clearly the subtext of their segment. Mark McCloskey called the protesters an \"out-of-control mob,\" describing Cori Bush, the Black Democratic congressional candidate who helped lead the group, as a \"Marxist, liberal activist\" and a \"Marxist revolutionary.\" He decried progressive proposals to defund the police and end cash bail, claiming that these policies are designed to protect criminals instead of \"honest citizens.\"\n\nRead: What Trump doesn't understand about the suburbs\n\nAs an accompanying video produced by the RNC panned from crowds of protesters back to the cloistered McCloskeys, the implication was clear: The \"criminals\" and \"mob\" are Black, while \"honest citizens\" are white. \"These radicals are not content with marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress,\" Mark McCloskey warned. \"They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden's party.\"\n\nThe McCloskeys, who have spent decades suing their neighbors and family members to protect their property, want power too. They have asserted \"squatter's rights\" on a patch of shared land in their subdivision, sued a dog breeder who sold them a German shepherd, and destroyed beehives that were part of the education curriculum at a synagogue next door to their property, threatening legal action if the congregation didn't clean up the mess, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently reported . \"They are bullies,\" the rabbi Susan Talve told The Forward yesterday. \"It's upsetting we make heroes out of people who hate.\"\n\nThe McCloskeys are avatars for Donald Trump's pitch to the country: Voters should be scared of what will happen if he is not reelected.\n\nRead: Revenge of the suburbs\n\nLike the McCloskeys, Trump has a target audience: suburbanites. Trump is deeply fearful of losing voters in the suburbs, who helped carry him to victory in 2016 . He recently tweeted that the \"suburban housewife\" will vote for him because \"they want safety\" and fear that low-income housing will \"invade\" their neighborhoods. He also promised to rescind an Obama-era rule designed to prevent housing discrimination, telling \"all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream\" to \"Enjoy!\" Patricia McCloskey echoed these sentiments last night: Protesters are \"not satisfied with spreading chaos and violence into our communities,\" she said. \"They want to abolish the suburbs altogether.\" In July, both of the McCloskeys were charged with one felony count each of unlawful use of a weapon. They deny that they committed any crime.\n\nBoth McCloskeys warned of shadowy threats lurking at the edge of their property: They're voting for the president because he wants to help families \"play in the backyard without fear,\" they said. The couple's doomsaying suggests that, to them, the suburbs are not an actual place, but an identity. They technically live within the St. Louis city limits, not far from the Loop, a dense area of shops and restaurants, and roughly 10 miles from Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in 2014.\n\nRead: Can the religious left flip the Bible Belt?\n\nTrump faces growing skepticism from Americans who actually live in the suburbs, nearly a third of whom are not white. There has been \"an awakening\" among suburban women since 2016, Georgia State Representative Erick Allen, who represents a suburban area outside of Atlanta, told me recently . As these women watched the McCloskeys last night, they heard the same message Trump has been pushing since the early days of his campaign: They should fear the people who live outside their neighborhoods, along with anyone calling for change in America. This messaging does not appear to be working: Only 36 percent of suburban women support the president, exacerbating his bad deficit against Biden, a July poll from ABC News and The Washington Post found. White suburbanites are far more worried about the economy and the COVID-19 crisis than crime, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from around the same time. And Trump is losing support in several suburban counties in the Midwest that were essential to his 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal recently reported . For all of Trump's efforts to court the suburbs, the people who live there might end up bringing his downfall."

      "text": "Progressives Can't Repeat the Mistakes of 2008\n\nFor the left to be effective in a post-Trump Washington, it must avoid the culture of deference that set in after Obama's victory.\n\nUpdated at 10:36 a.m. ET on November 29, 2020.\n\nEmotionally and politically, 2008 stands as a high-water mark for many American liberals-a year that brought both electoral triumph and national renewal as Barack Obama was swept into office and Democrats took the House and Senate. For those on the progressive left today, however, it should serve as a warning and case study in the way that popular energy and progressive agitation can dissipate when a Democratic administration takes power.\n\nIn purely electoral terms, 2020 is unlike 2008: The Democrats defeated Donald Trump but suffered unexpected losses down-ballot, failing to produce the highly anticipated blue wave. Political analogies are rarely exact. Notwithstanding their obvious points of contrast, however, 2020 and 2008 have several useful points of comparison, well beyond a shared context of economic calamity, global crisis, and the recent defeat of a Republican president.\n\nAdam Serwer: The crisis of American democracy is not over\n\nThe George W. Bush era once created a powerful constellation of grassroots organizations and progressive infrastructure around a variety of causes that spanned the fight for universal health care to opposing the administration's foreign and domestic-security policies. United around their desire to see the Republicans defeated in 2008, a motley coalition of dissenters, bloggers, and activists helped give liberal politics the populist energy that would be so adeptly harnessed by Obama's first campaign for president. Amid the euphoria of his landslide victory, much of that energy would fold into garden-variety Democratic partisanship afraid to issue even tepid criticism of its own side. As a result, despite all the initial talk of change, people power, and movement building, the guiding ethos of Obama-era liberalism would quickly become one of deference and disengagement.\n\nThe causes of that malaise were many, but several are germane today.\n\nIn 2008, Obama secured a mandate that was at once extraordinarily sweeping and astonishingly vague-not least because his gift for political storytelling made him difficult for people to place on the political spectrum. When combined with the fatigue that inevitably accompanies any sustained period of Republican rule and a victory of historic proportions, Obama's kaleidoscopic rhetoric-a dizzying medley of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and FDR-gave politics-weary liberals the implicit permission to abandon their activist posture and let the administration operate on its own inertia. During Bush's second term, a less-than-negligible swath of Democrats and would-be progressives had come to see themselves as dissidents waging an uphill struggle against special interests and defective institutions; during Obama's first, many would abandon oppositional politics entirely, pivoting instead to the post-partisan platitudes that inspired 2010's quasi-ironic Rally to Restore Sanity.\n\nIf progressives in the years leading up to 2008 banged the drum around slogans of change and renewal, the major theme after Obama's inauguration was that the war had been won and the adults were now in charge. This also happened to be the message coming straight from the top, as plans to strengthen the powerful grassroots organizing infrastructure that had propelled Obama's campaign were scrapped and it instead became a glorified listserv for the DNC.\n\nSigns that the administration was setting a more conservative course than grassroots enthusiasts had expected came quickly, but criticism was often muted to nonexistent during its critical first two years. The public option for health-care coverage, already a climbdown from the single-payer model supported by rank-and-file Democrats, was dropped with minimal outcry even though it had a chance to pass the Senate. When the administration walked back its flagship labor legislation, union leaders offered not resistance but praise . As a recession gutted livelihoods and produced a wave of home foreclosures, Obama rejected a New Deal-scale transformation of the economy. Yet no progressive insurgency materialized to demand a more aggressive approach. (On the contrary, thanks to the Tea Party, populist anger would become the terrain of the right.) The retreats of 2009 and 2010 were a disaster for the activists and progressives whose enthusiasm had helped bring Obama to power; they also proved highly damaging to the Democrats, who held fewer elected offices nationwide than at any period since the 1920s by the end of his second term.\n\nRead: Joe Biden has a Barack Obama problem\n\nJoe Biden might have none of his former running mate's oratory or personal charisma, but his victory comes on the heels of a similarly intense period of political engagement and extra-parliamentary organizing and advocacy. On issues ranging from immigrant rights to economic inequality to racial and environmental justice, the Trump era has seen a genuine upsurge in support for important progressive causes. Once again, this activist energy is set to collide with a Democratic administration whose mandate is hazily defined: Americans have just voted in record numbers for Trump's replacement, but the Biden project, beyond the realization of that singular goal, remains deliberately murky at the level of detail.\n\nTwelve years ago, a landslide Democratic victory became the catalyst for complacency and silence in the face of legislative retreat. Today, as a liberal administration enters office on comparatively weak political ground, and amid political exhaustion, activists and left-wing lawmakers will feel yet more pressure to temper their agitation and stick to partisan deference. In fact, evidence of that pressure is already abundant: While ballots were still being counted , party grandees and Blue Dogs blamed both activists and progressive rhetoric for the party's dismal down-ballot results.\n\nBut if progressives have reason to worry that the popular energies marshaled during the Trump years will lose coherence and vanish into the miasma of official Washington, they have even better reason to hope that the left has learned from past mistakes. In recent years, organizations like Justice Democrats have made insurgent primary challenges against conservative incumbents a semi-regular occurrence. As a direct result of those efforts, the left now counts more nationally recognizable figures among its congressional ranks than at any other point in recent history; 2018 newcomers like Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are set to be joined by the likes of Cori Bush, Jamaal Bowman, and Mondaire Jones.\n\nEquipped with an ambitious legislative agenda and battle-hardened by Bernie Sanders's two insurgent presidential campaigns, activists and their political surrogates are much better placed today than in 2008 to offer an alternative to the usual liberal incrementalism. Rather than wait for the administration to act, progressive lawmakers are continuing their push for Medicare for All-\"universal health care\" no longer being a vague catch-all but a clearly defined goal. Where it was once considered bold for liberal politicians to rhetorically embrace the science of climate change, the most important environmental litmus test is now the ambitious Green New Deal. Further initiatives around criminal-justice reform, the taxation of extreme wealth, and the cancellation of student debt give added substance and coherence to a progressive movement that simply did not exist-independent of the ever-circumspect Democratic mainstream-the last time a liberal president entered the White House.\n\nRead: The Democratic truce is over\n\nIn the short term, pursuing and strengthening this alternative will require sustained public pressure on the incoming administration, particularly with regard to Cabinet appointments. In the longer term, it will require standing firm on marquee progressive priorities while consistently meeting Biden's conservative instincts with a countervailing force. Even if it lacks a Senate majority, the administration will have plenty of potential latitude to make change via executive order. From postal banking to Wall Street regulation, from drug prices to student-debt relief, the Biden administration could realize quite literally hundreds of progressive measures without ever descending into the labyrinth of Congress. Most are unlikely to see the light of day unless a progressively minded opposition is willing to fight for them.\n\nIn 2008, amid an economic crisis and a national hunger for change, progressives allowed a Democratic victory to drown their ambitions and inspire a culture of deference and passivity. As Donald Trump leaves office, in the aftermath of street protests and as a pandemic ravages America, it's a history the activist left cannot afford to repeat."

      "text": "The Culture War Over 'Pregnant People'\n\nSome advocates on the left want America to talk about pregnancy and birth in gender-neutral terms. But this language change might not be so easy for the country to embrace.\n\nLast year, a brand-new labor-and-delivery hospital opened on the well-to-do Upper East Side of New York City. Its name, the Alexandra Cohen Hospital for Women and Newborns, might strike most people as innocuous or straightforward. But to some people, the suggestion that a hospital where babies are born is for women is offensive, because transgender and nonbinary people who do not identify as women can also get pregnant and deliver babies.\n\nOnly niche groups tend to care about how Americans discuss gender and pregnancy-including whether it's better to use the term pregnant people instead of pregnant women . But those groups care a lot. Representative Cori Bush of Missouri used the term birthing people in a hearing, causing a mini-uproar on social media. \"When we talk about 'birthing people,' we're being inclusive. It's that simple,\" the pro-abortion-rights group NARAL tweeted in her defense. Others, however, see this kind of language as exclusionary because it erases women and mothers as worthy categories of identity. Ann Romney, the wife of Senator Mitt Romney, tweeted angrily in June, \"The Biden administration diminishing motherhood to 'birthing person' is simply insulting to all moms.\" It was the first time she had tweeted all year.\n\nAnd yet, Americans who don't mainline niche political or linguistic fights probably don't even know this is a debate. When I texted a friend in a small, liberal-ish city about this topic recently, he had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nRead: America's profound gender anxiety\n\nTo understand the contours of the debate, I called Louise Melling, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who leads projects on women's rights and LGBTQ rights. Although she does not identify as transgender or nonbinary, she is one of the country's most influential progressive legal thinkers on gender norms and the law. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nEmma Green: Why do you believe it's important to shift our language around gender and pregnancy?\n\nLouise Melling: First of all, if we're talking about \"pregnant people,\" that language says to people-to transgender men and to nonbinary people-\"we see you.\" It should do a fair amount of work to help address discrimination. If we talk about \"pregnant people,\" it's a reminder to all of us to catch ourselves when we're sitting in the waiting room at the GYN that we're not going to stare at the man who's there. We're not going to be disconcerted.\n\nMore importantly, we're not going to behave in a way that makes that person uncomfortable-that signals discrimination and unwelcomeness to them. And that's incredibly important when we think about the kinds of discrimination that continue to be pervasive against transgender people and nonbinary people.\n\nIt's nothing short of heartbreaking to read about the experiences of transgender people seeking health care . If somebody is hostile to you, you're not going to go back. So we have really serious consequences for transgender people-people who already are really in need of health care, who are often of lower income because of all the discrimination they face.\n\nIt is the reality that not only women seek abortions. It is not only women who are birthing. It is not only women who are seeking mammography and pap smears and other care. And recognizing that does real work.\n\nGreen: This may be hard to summarize, but where do things stand-both in terms of how these terms are used legally, but also how they're used in the culture?\n\nMelling: It's interesting to me, for example, that the CDC website now speaks of \"pregnant people.\" With every passing year, it's more pervasive. My GYN just talked to me about this: \"Oh, I just learned this,\" and was really working to change her language.\n\nRead: When your pregnancy is political\n\nGreen: Within the legal worlds you run in-at organizations like the ACLU-is there consensus on the use of gender-neutral terms to refer to pregnancy? Or is there some remaining debate?\n\nMelling: In the spaces in which I find myself most commonly, people are really committed to talking about \"pregnant people.\" People are really committed to using gender-neutral language . Historically, people have been punished for deviating from gender norms. That includes women, that includes transgender people, that includes nonbinary people. I see commonality, not difference, in this struggle.\n\nI work on reproductive rights. I work on women's rights. I work on LGBTQ rights. My colleagues are people who are in pain. My colleagues are people who are excluded because of language. They are threatened because of language. When you think about the bills that passed this year , they try not only to attack, but almost obliterate transgender people . A total erasure from the language has huge consequences.\n\nThe depth of the discrimination, the pain of the discrimination, the urgency of opening up space for people to be seen-that's something I've really learned from my colleagues.\n\nGreen: Your gig covers a lot of different angles of the law-you work on women's rights, and you work on LGBTQ rights. And I wonder: Is there a cost to gender-neutral language around pregnancy for women? For example: An employer sees a pregnant woman and notices her bump starting to grow and immediately thinks, \"Oh, I need to take her off that project because she's going to become a mom and she's going to want to step back from work or stay home.\" For better or worse, I don't know if employers would have the same kind of attentiveness to changes in a trans man's body, at least not around pregnancy.\n\nIf, legally speaking, you treat pregnancy like it's gender-neutral, do you think that could end up hurting women, who face different kinds of discrimination than trans and nonbinary people?\n\nMelling: I don't see it as an either/or. For example, I think it's critical that we talk about \"pregnant people,\" that we use language that tries to address discrimination, that lets transgender people and nonbinary people feel seen.\n\nAt the same time, I also talk about the ways in which restrictions on abortion constitute gender discrimination and, in particular, target women. When legislators are passing these measures, they have women in mind, and they're passing these measures as part of a historic trend of trying to press women into one particular role. Abortion restrictions perpetuate gender stereotypes and thwart prospects towards equality.\n\nYou can acknowledge that, while women may be the dominant group hurt by this particular restriction, abortion is not a service sought only by women.\n\nGreen: On the one hand, you can think about terms like pregnant people as being more inclusive: They provide legal cover to the broadest universe of people who might experience pregnancy, and they also invite us to reimagine who might have this kind of experience.\n\nBut aspects of these terms are also exclusionary. Talking about \"birthing people\" means you are not talking about \"women giving birth\" or \"birth moms.\" That's an affirmative identity that people really care about.\n\nDo you agree with that at all-that gender-neutral language around pregnancy may be exclusionary in some way?\n\nMelling: Not if we're doing it right. You can talk about birthing as an experience that is common to so many women, as well as an experience for transgender men and nonbinary people. You can have more expansive language. This is how people sometimes talk about BIPOC : That's a broad category, but then you can be more specific about how certain restrictions affect Indigenous people or Black people. You can put emphasis in different places while still recognizing broader harm. You just have to be more intentional. You have to do more work.\n\nOne analogy that I think might help is breast cancer. I don't even remember when I first heard about men who get breast cancer. I will admit: I hadn't thought about it. The man who has breast cancer has his own fear of the diagnosis. Then he's going to struggle going into a whole host of places that are gendered. We addressed a gap in care to try and encourage women to come forward and have a community. But we also need to make space so that men with breast cancer can be recognized both by the medical profession and by the rest of us.\n\nGreen: It seems like there's also a flip side to that example: Without specific, gendered targeting around particular health needs, women might also miss out on care. Pregnancy is really hard! And it's often a super gendered experience. You're chained to your body, and gender really shapes how people view you and what you're going through.\n\nI think at least some women navigate that by affirming their new identity: I am a mother. This is part of being a woman. I see myself in that. I find solace in it. So I guess this comes back to the same question: Do you think there's something lost in trying to create a more inclusive vision of pregnancy?\n\nMelling: I don't think the increasing reliance on language like pregnant people means you can't define yourself as a mother, or say this is an experience many women go through, or recognize that I'm experiencing this in really gendered ways. One of the things that Ruth Bader Ginsburg emphasized was the way in which gender stereotypes, gender roles, and gender norms hurt all of us by locking us into some kind of vision. Women can speak about our experience, but that doesn't preclude men from speaking about how gender has affected them, too.\n\nTalking about birthing and gender discrimination is still something that women can do. We just also simultaneously want to talk about the ways in which we're not recognizing trans men as parents. If we're doing this right, we're creating more, not less, conversation, because we're talking about the many different ways in which gender expectations are playing out on who we are.\n\nRead: When doctors refuse to treat LGBTQ patients\n\nGreen: Is there any part of your feminist self that has worried about the potential consequences of this as a cultural and legal move?\n\nMelling: No, because I see the commonality. That's one of the beauties of being at the ACLU. You live intersectionality in terms of conversations about the law and conversations you have in the kitchen-in your collegiality as well as your legal theory.\n\nGreen: This may be an unwelcome imaginative exercise. But I wonder if you have spent time thinking about why this makes some people on the right so mad. Why do you think people care about this?\n\nMelling: Look, why do people get mad that people marry the person they love? If you want to have a child on your own, why do people get mad? If you fall in love with somebody of another race? I think there may be some people who are confused at first-changes in language have to come with education. But for those prominent politicians, whether it's on abortion rights or transgender rights or voting rights, there's clearly an effort to have society be more narrow in imagination and inclusivity.\n\nGreen: Do you think it's possible to make a good-faith argument against the use of birthing people ?\n\nMelling: I definitely think there's a good-faith person who wants to ask a question. Change is hard. People want to hold on to their particular world. Or maybe it is not intuitive to people. But maybe it was hard for people to all of a sudden have a woman be the person at the law firm who managed their case, too.\n\nGreen: This may be another unwelcome imaginative exercise. But I'm sure you've heard the argument from some people on the right that the left has a culturally authoritarian streak. They embrace certain buzzwords and ways of thinking that are often reflective of academic thought, and it can seem like overnight, everyone is expected to use those words. If you don't use the right language, you're considered a bigot, or you get canceled.\n\nDo you worry about that? That trying to shift something as fundamental as people's perception of motherhood might further fuel this kind of cultural backlash?\n\nMelling: I think this characterization is exaggerated and not true in really profound ways. Nobody is stopped from speaking about her motherhood or the importance of that. I go out of my way to talk about parenting so that men can be seen as parents. Not 'You're not a mother,' but [opening] up space so that we no longer have the cultural expectation that women are the caregivers.\n\nWe need to do a good job of explaining why we care-explaining what the goals are here and talking about the ways in which gender stereotypes really do lock everybody into different kinds of roles."

      "text": "The Culture War Over 'Pregnant People'\n\nSome advocates on the left want America to talk about pregnancy and birth in gender-neutral terms. But this language change might not be so easy for the country to embrace.\n\nLast year, a brand-new labor-and-delivery hospital opened on the well-to-do Upper East Side of New York City. Its name, the Alexandra Cohen Hospital for Women and Newborns, might strike most people as innocuous or straightforward. But to some people, the suggestion that a hospital where babies are born is for women is offensive, because transgender and nonbinary people who do not identify as women can also get pregnant and deliver babies.\n\nOnly niche groups tend to care about how Americans discuss gender and pregnancy-including whether it's better to use the term pregnant people instead of pregnant women . But those groups care a lot. Representative Cori Bush of Missouri used the term birthing people in a hearing, causing a mini-uproar on social media. \"When we talk about 'birthing people,' we're being inclusive. It's that simple,\" the pro-abortion-rights group NARAL tweeted in her defense. Others, however, see this kind of language as exclusionary because it erases women and mothers as worthy categories of identity. Ann Romney, the wife of Senator Mitt Romney, tweeted angrily in June, \"The Biden administration diminishing motherhood to 'birthing person' is simply insulting to all moms.\" It was the first time she had tweeted all year.\n\nAnd yet, Americans who don't mainline niche political or linguistic fights probably don't even know this is a debate. When I texted a friend in a small, liberal-ish city about this topic recently, he had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nRead: America's profound gender anxiety\n\nTo understand the contours of the debate, I called Louise Melling, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who leads projects on women's rights and LGBTQ rights. Although she does not identify as transgender or nonbinary, she is one of the country's most influential progressive legal thinkers on gender norms and the law. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nEmma Green: Why do you believe it's important to shift our language around gender and pregnancy?\n\nLouise Melling: First of all, if we're talking about \"pregnant people,\" that language says to people-to transgender men and to nonbinary people-\"we see you.\" It should do a fair amount of work to help address discrimination. If we talk about \"pregnant people,\" it's a reminder to all of us to catch ourselves when we're sitting in the waiting room at the GYN that we're not going to stare at the man who's there. We're not going to be disconcerted.\n\nMore importantly, we're not going to behave in a way that makes that person uncomfortable-that signals discrimination and unwelcomeness to them. And that's incredibly important when we think about the kinds of discrimination that continue to be pervasive against transgender people and nonbinary people.\n\nIt's nothing short of heartbreaking to read about the experiences of transgender people seeking health care . If somebody is hostile to you, you're not going to go back. So we have really serious consequences for transgender people-people who already are really in need of health care, who are often of lower income because of all the discrimination they face.\n\nIt is the reality that not only women seek abortions. It is not only women who are birthing. It is not only women who are seeking mammography and pap smears and other care. And recognizing that does real work.\n\nGreen: This may be hard to summarize, but where do things stand-both in terms of how these terms are used legally, but also how they're used in the culture?\n\nMelling: It's interesting to me, for example, that the CDC website now speaks of \"pregnant people.\" With every passing year, it's more pervasive. My GYN just talked to me about this: \"Oh, I just learned this,\" and was really working to change her language.\n\nRead: When your pregnancy is political\n\nGreen: Within the legal worlds you run in-at organizations like the ACLU-is there consensus on the use of gender-neutral terms to refer to pregnancy? Or is there some remaining debate?\n\nMelling: In the spaces in which I find myself most commonly, people are really committed to talking about \"pregnant people.\" People are really committed to using gender-neutral language . Historically, people have been punished for deviating from gender norms. That includes women, that includes transgender people, that includes nonbinary people.

      "text": "The Problem With a 50-50 Senate\n\nA double victory in Georgia could create serious difficulties for Democrats-and might even make it less likely for Biden to win reelection.\n\nW hen the networks declared Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election, his agenda seemed stillborn. Because most observers assumed that Republicans would win at least one of the two Georgia Senate runoffs and retain control of the upper chamber, they thought that Biden wouldn't get much of anything done. But Raphael Warnock defeated Kelly Loeffler in Georgia last night, and Jon Ossoff currently leads David Perdue in the tally, leaving the Democrats likely to take control of the Senate.\n\nThis is good news. Georgians seem to have repudiated Donald Trump's ongoing assault on democratic institutions. Judging from the apparent results, they no longer want Mitch McConnell and the obstructionist Republicans to be in charge of the United States Senate. And they hope to give the incoming president a chance to actually govern the country.\n\nRead: Georgia's gift to Joe Biden\n\nDemocrats will, if the current vote tallies stand, enjoy unified control of Congress. That would allow them to push through Biden's nominations for the Cabinet, the judiciary, and key agencies like the Federal Reserve. And by taking over the leadership of the chamber's committees, they would actually be able to shape Congress's agenda.\n\nFor these reasons, if I were a resident of Georgia, I would not have hesitated for a moment before voting for Ossoff and Warnock. But a double victory would, nonetheless, create serious difficulties for Democrats-and might even make it less likely for Biden to win reelection.\n\nI f Democrats enjoy full control of the government, progressives will push to advance a wish list that includes the Green New Deal, radically overhauling health care, a new Voting Rights Act, packing the Supreme Court, and granting statehood to Washington, D.C.\n\nBut even victories in Georgia wouldn't give Democrats nearly enough power to make those kinds of changes. In the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has to hold together a slim 11-vote majority that includes both democratic socialists like Cori Bush and staunch moderates like Abigail Spanberger. In the Senate, the filibuster means that any major legislation will require 60 votes-which is to say at least 10 Republican senators-to advance.\n\nEven when a simple majority is sufficient, Democrats need every single member of their caucus, including blue-dog Democrats from deep-red states, like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to get on board. And because Manchin has already said that he is not willing to abolish the filibuster, hopes for far-reaching institutional reforms really are dead on arrival.\n\nDavid Litt: The Senate filibuster is another monument to white supremacy\n\nMost of the deeply progressive policies on which leftist activists have set their heart simply don't enjoy a majority in the United States Congress. And even if, against the odds, Biden and his team somehow manage to push one of these projects through a recalcitrant Congress, a Supreme Court dominated by conservative judges might well quash it after the fact.\n\nOn paper, Biden looks set to gain unified control over Congress. In practice, he won't enjoy many of its traditional benefits. But he will suffer from all of its downsides.\n\nI f Perdue or Loeffler had held on to their Senate seat, which now seems unlikely, Fox News would still have done its best to inspire vitriol against Biden. But a president who has repeatedly promised to be a restorative rather than a revolutionary figure in office, and who doesn't even have control of the Senate, would have made it much harder for conservative talking heads to inspire fear about the radical changes afoot. If Ossoff and Warnock win, their job will get a good bit easier.\n\nRepublican control of the Senate would also have made it much simpler for Biden to manage the expectations of the party's activist wing. If activists had pushed for progressive policies that were deeply unpopular with most Americans, Biden could truthfully have pointed to Mitch McConnell's majority as a reason to desist. Every one of McConnell's obstructionist moves would have delayed a civil war within the Democratic Party by another week or month.\n\nFinally, a Republican Senate would have provided the White House with a compelling culprit for anything that might go wrong in the next four years. When facing the voters again in 2024, Biden could have blamed his opponents' refusal to cooperate or compromise for the country's problems-and asked them for a clearer mandate to finish the job.\n\nAll in all, Ossoff and Warnock winning is better than the alternative. The moderate changes-such as greater infrastructure spending and much-needed fixes to the Affordable Care Act-Democrats should be able to push through a Congress in which Joe Manchin casts the decisive vote can make a positive difference in the life of average Americans. And it would have been depressing if voters in Georgia had rewarded Trump and the Republican Party for their irresponsible refusal to accept the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nBut the relief over the likely result in Georgia should not make us forget that the White House will in some ways face the worst of both worlds. Conservatives will rally around an obstructionist agenda. Progressives will blame Biden for his inevitable failure to enact radical policies. But whatever he does, he simply does not have enough power to force the change that many in his party desire."

      "text": "The McCloskeys' Unsubtle Message to White America\n\nMark and Patricia McCloskey appeared at the Republican National Convention to warn that Democrats want to \"abolish the suburbs.\" Their vision of America is premised on fear-and dominating others.\n\nP atricia and Mark McCloskey sat close together on their burnt-red scalloped couch, the dark wood-paneled walls behind them teasing the grandeur of their St. Louis home, which has been decorated with French silk damask wall coverings, classical-style ceiling murals, and marble urns depicting the Roman god Neptune out front. In June, the pair stood on their lawn, barefoot in slacks, beside carefully curated shrubbery, waving a pistol and an AR-15-style rifle at Black Lives Matter protesters who were headed toward the mayor's house. The standoff made national news-and earned the couple an invitation to speak at this week's Republican National Convention. \"Make no mistake,\" Patricia McCloskey told viewers last night, \"no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats' America.\"\n\nThe McCloskeys didn't talk about race explicitly, but racial fear was clearly the subtext of their segment. Mark McCloskey called the protesters an \"out-of-control mob,\" describing Cori Bush, the Black Democratic congressional candidate who helped lead the group, as a \"Marxist, liberal activist\" and a \"Marxist revolutionary.\" He decried progressive proposals to defund the police and end cash bail, claiming that these policies are designed to protect criminals instead of \"honest citizens.\"\n\nRead: What Trump doesn't understand about the suburbs\n\nAs an accompanying video produced by the RNC panned from crowds of protesters back to the cloistered McCloskeys, the implication was clear: The \"criminals\" and \"mob\" are Black, while \"honest citizens\" are white. \"These radicals are not content with marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress,\" Mark McCloskey warned. \"They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden's party.\"\n\nThe McCloskeys, who have spent decades suing their neighbors and family members to protect their property, want power too. They have asserted \"squatter's rights\" on a patch of shared land in their subdivision, sued a dog breeder who sold them a German shepherd, and destroyed beehives that were part of the education curriculum at a synagogue next door to their property, threatening legal action if the congregation didn't clean up the mess, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently reported . \"They are bullies,\" the rabbi Susan Talve told The Forward yesterday. \"It's upsetting we make heroes out of people who hate.\"\n\nThe McCloskeys are avatars for Donald Trump's pitch to the country: Voters should be scared of what will happen if he is not reelected.\n\nRead: Revenge of the suburbs\n\nLike the McCloskeys, Trump has a target audience: suburbanites. Trump is deeply fearful of losing voters in the suburbs, who helped carry him to victory in 2016 . He recently tweeted that the \"suburban housewife\" will vote for him because \"they want safety\" and fear that low-income housing will \"invade\" their neighborhoods. He also promised to rescind an Obama-era rule designed to prevent housing discrimination, telling \"all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream\" to \"Enjoy!\" Patricia McCloskey echoed these sentiments last night: Protesters are \"not satisfied with spreading chaos and violence into our communities,\" she said. \"They want to abolish the suburbs altogether.\" In July, both of the McCloskeys were charged with one felony count each of unlawful use of a weapon. They deny that they committed any crime.\n\nBoth McCloskeys warned of shadowy threats lurking at the edge of their property: They're voting for the president because he wants to help families \"play in the backyard without fear,\" they said. The couple's doomsaying suggests that, to them, the suburbs are not an actual place, but an identity. They technically live within the St. Louis city limits, not far from the Loop, a dense area of shops and restaurants, and roughly 10 miles from Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in 2014.\n\nRead: Can the religious left flip the Bible Belt?\n\nTrump faces growing skepticism from Americans who actually live in the suburbs, nearly a third of whom are not white. There has been \"an awakening\" among suburban women since 2016, Georgia State Representative Erick Allen, who represents a suburban area outside of Atlanta, told me recently . As these women watched the McCloskeys last night, they heard the same message Trump has been pushing since the early days of his campaign: They should fear the people who live outside their neighborhoods, along with anyone calling for change in America. This messaging does not appear to be working: Only 36 percent of suburban women support the president, exacerbating his bad deficit against Biden, a July poll from ABC News and The Washington Post found. White suburbanites are far more worried about the economy and the COVID-19 crisis than crime, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from around the same time. And Trump is losing support in several suburban counties in the Midwest that were essential to his 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal recently reported . For all of Trump's efforts to court the suburbs, the people who live there might end up bringing his downfall."

When I texted a friend in a small, liberal-ish city about this topic recently, he had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nRead: America's profound gender anxiety\n\nTo understand the contours of the debate, I called Louise Melling, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who leads projects on women's rights and LGBTQ rights. Although she does not identify as transgender or nonbinary, she is one of the country's most influential progressive legal thinkers on gender norms and the law. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nEmma Green: Why do you believe it's important to shift our language around gender and pregnancy?\n\nLouise Melling: First of all, if we're talking about \"pregnant people,\" that language says to people-to transgender men and to nonbinary people-\"we see you.\" It should do a fair amount of work to help address discrimination. If we talk about \"pregnant people,\" it's a reminder to all of us to catch ourselves when we're sitting in the waiting room at the GYN that we're not going to stare at the man who's there. We're not going to be disconcerted.\n\nMore importantly, we're not going to behave in a way that makes that person uncomfortable-that signals discrimination and unwelcomeness to them. And that's incredibly important when we think about the kinds of discrimination that continue to be pervasive against transgender people and nonbinary people.\n\nIt's nothing short of heartbreaking to read about the experiences of transgender people seeking health care . If somebody is hostile to you, you're not going to go back. So we have really serious consequences for transgender people-people who already are really in need of health care, who are often of lower income because of all the discrimination they face.\n\nIt is the reality that not only women seek abortions. It is not only women who are birthing. It is not only women who are seeking mammography and pap smears and other care. And recognizing that does real work.\n\nGreen: This may be hard to summarize, but where do things stand-both in terms of how these terms are used legally, but also how they're used in the culture?\n\nMelling: It's interesting to me, for example, that the CDC website now speaks of \"pregnant people.\" With every passing year, it's more pervasive. My GYN just talked to me about this: \"Oh, I just learned this,\" and was really working to change her language.\n\nRead: When your pregnancy is political\n\nGreen: Within the legal worlds you run in-at organizations like the ACLU-is there consensus on the use of gender-neutral terms to refer to pregnancy? Or is there some remaining debate?\n\nMelling: In the spaces in which I find myself most commonly, people are really committed to talking about \"pregnant people.\" People are really committed to using gender-neutral language . Historically, people have been punished for deviating from gender norms. That includes women, that includes transgender people, that includes nonbinary people. I see commonality, not difference, in this struggle.\n\nI work on reproductive rights. I work on women's rights. I work on LGBTQ rights. My colleagues are people who are in pain. My colleagues are people who are excluded because of language. They are threatened because of language. When you think about the bills that passed this year , they try not only to attack, but almost obliterate transgender people . A total erasure from the language has huge consequences.\n\nThe depth of the discrimination, the pain of the discrimination, the urgency of opening up space for people to be seen-that's something I've really learned from my colleagues.\n\nGreen: Your gig covers a lot of different angles of the law-you work on women's rights, and you work on LGBTQ rights. And I wonder: Is there a cost to gender-neutral language around pregnancy for women? For example: An employer sees a pregnant woman and notices her bump starting to grow and immediately thinks, \"Oh, I need to take her off that project because she's going to become a mom and she's going to want to step back from work or stay home.\" For better or worse, I don't know if employers would have the same kind of attentiveness to changes in a trans man's body, at least not around pregnancy.\n\nIf, legally speaking, you treat pregnancy like it's gender-neutral, do you think that could end up hurting women, who face different kinds of discrimination than trans and nonbinary people?\n\nMelling: I don't see it as an either/or. For example, I think it's critical that we talk about \"pregnant people,\" that we use language that tries to address discrimination, that lets transgender people and nonbinary people feel seen.\n\nAt the same time, I also talk about the ways in which restrictions on abortion constitute gender discrimination and, in particular, target women. When legislators are passing these measures, they have women in mind, and they're passing these measures as part of a historic trend of trying to press women into one particular role. Abortion restrictions perpetuate gender stereotypes and thwart prospects towards equality.\n\nYou can acknowledge that, while women may be the dominant group hurt by this particular restriction, abortion is not a service sought only by women.\n\nGreen: On the one hand, you can think about terms like pregnant people as being more inclusive: They provide legal cover to the broadest universe of people who might experience pregnancy, and they also invite us to reimagine who might have this kind of experience.\n\nBut aspects of these terms are also exclusionary. Talking about \"birthing people\" means you are not talking about \"women giving birth\" or \"birth moms.\" That's an affirmative identity that people really care about.\n\nDo you agree with that at all-that gender-neutral language around pregnancy may be exclusionary in some way?\n\nMelling: Not if we're doing it right. You can talk about birthing as an experience that is common to so many women, as well as an experience for transgender men and nonbinary people. You can have more expansive language. This is how people sometimes talk about BIPOC : That's a broad category, but then you can be more specific about how certain restrictions affect Indigenous people or Black people. You can put emphasis in different places while still recognizing broader harm. You just have to be more intentional. You have to do more work.\n\nOne analogy that I think might help is breast cancer. I don't even remember when I first heard about men who get breast cancer. I will admit: I hadn't thought about it. The man who has breast cancer has his own fear of the diagnosis. Then he's going to struggle going into a whole host of places that are gendered. We addressed a gap in care to try and encourage women to come forward and have a community. But we also need to make space so that men with breast cancer can be recognized both by the medical profession and by the rest of us.\n\nGreen: It seems like there's also a flip side to that example: Without specific, gendered targeting around particular health needs, women might also miss out on care. Pregnancy is really hard! And it's often a super gendered experience. You're chained to your body, and gender really shapes how people view you and what you're going through.\n\nI think at least some women navigate that by affirming their new identity: I am a mother. This is part of being a woman. I see myself in that. I find solace in it. So I guess this comes back to the same question: Do you think there's something lost in trying to create a more inclusive vision of pregnancy?\n\nMelling: I don't think the increasing reliance on language like pregnant people means you can't define yourself as a mother, or say this is an experience many women go through, or recognize that I'm experiencing this in really gendered ways. One of the things that Ruth Bader Ginsburg emphasized was the way in which gender stereotypes, gender roles, and gender norms hurt all of us by locking us into some kind of vision. Women can speak about our experience, but that doesn't preclude men from speaking about how gender has affected them, too.\n\nTalking about birthing and gender discrimination is still something that women can do. We just also simultaneously want to talk about the ways in which we're not recognizing trans men as parents. If we're doing this right, we're creating more, not less, conversation, because we're talking about the many different ways in which gender expectations are playing out on who we are.\n\nRead: When doctors refuse to treat LGBTQ patients\n\nGreen: Is there any part of your feminist self that has worried about the potential consequences of this as a cultural and legal move?\n\nMelling: No, because I see the commonality. That's one of the beauties of being at the ACLU. You live intersectionality in terms of conversations about the law and conversations you have in the kitchen-in your collegiality as well as your legal theory.\n\nGreen: This may be an unwelcome imaginative exercise. But I wonder if you have spent time thinking about why this makes some people on the right so mad. Why do you think people care about this?\n\nMelling: Look, why do people get mad that people marry the person they love? If you want to have a child on your own, why do people get mad? If you fall in love with somebody of another race? I think there may be some people who are confused at first-changes in language have to come with education. But for those prominent politicians, whether it's on abortion rights or transgender rights or voting rights, there's clearly an effort to have society be more narrow in imagination and inclusivity.\n\nGreen: Do you think it's possible to make a good-faith argument against the use of birthing people ?\n\nMelling: I definitely think there's a good-faith person who wants to ask a question. Change is hard. People want to hold on to their particular world. Or maybe it is not intuitive to people. But maybe it was hard for people to all of a sudden have a woman be the person at the law firm who managed their case, too.\n\nGreen: This may be another unwelcome imaginative exercise. But I'm sure you've heard the argument from some people on the right that the left has a culturally authoritarian streak. They embrace certain buzzwords and ways of thinking that are often reflective of academic thought, and it can seem like overnight, everyone is expected to use those words. If you don't use the right language, you're considered a bigot, or you get canceled.\n\nDo you worry about that? That trying to shift something as fundamental as people's perception of motherhood might further fuel this kind of cultural backlash?\n\nMelling: I think this characterization is exaggerated and not true in really profound ways. Nobody is stopped from speaking about her motherhood or the importance of that. I go out of my way to talk about parenting so that men can be seen as parents. Not 'You're not a mother,' but [opening] up space so that we no longer have the cultural expectation that women are the caregivers.\n\nWe need to do a good job of explaining why we care-explaining what the goals are here and talking about the ways in which gender stereotypes really do lock everybody into different kinds of roles."

Cori Bush Tells AIPAC She's 'Coming to Tear Your Kingdom Down' After Primary Loss\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nFirebrand Democrat Cori Bush blamed the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC for losing her primary in an angry concession speech, saying \"I'm coming to tear your kingdom down.\" Bush lost to Democratic primary challenger Wesley Bell and blamed money spent by AIPAC for her defeat then claimed the loss had served to \"radicalize her.\" Bush has been an outspoken opponent of Israel, stepping up her rhetoric after the Israeli government's military response in Gaza to the Oct. 7 terror attacks.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush Confirms Feds Are Probing Her Security Spending\n\nSenior Political Reporter\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been corrected to reflect that Steve Muhammad, who owns RS&T Security, is not the same Steve Muhammad who was involved in a scuffle with the media. The Daily Beast regrets the error.\n\nThe day after a mysterious House floor announcement of a federal subpoena for an unnamed Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) publicly confirmed on Tuesday that her campaign spending is under investigation by the Department of Justice, the Federal Election Commission, and the House Committee on Ethics.\n\nIn her statement , Bush said the investigations are focused on her campaign's substantial security expenses, which have long drawn media scrutiny and a number of outside complaints. She broadly denounced those complaints as politically motivated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"First and foremost, I hold myself, my campaign, and my position to the highest levels of integrity. I also believe in transparency which is why I can confirm that the Department of Justice is reviewing my campaign's spending on security services,\" Bush said in her statement, adding that the campaign was \"fully cooperating\" with investigators.\n\nIn all, the Bush campaign has spent nearly $780,000 on personal security since 2019, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\nWhile officeholders and candidates are permitted to use both campaign and federal funds to pay for personal protection, Bush has long been under fire for those expenses-most specifically her campaign's payments to her husband, Cortney Merritts. That was the focus of an investigation by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which cleared Bush of wrongdoing last October.\n\nBeyond Merritts, however, the Bush campaign has tapped a revolving cast of security consultants, which include reputable groups as well as less-established and quite controversial entities. One top contractor for Bush has been Nathaniel Davis, an unlicensed bodyguard who has spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and claimed to be 109 trillion years old with the power to summon tornadoes.\n\nIn her statement, Bush blamed conservative media for sensationalizing their coverage of her security expenses and generating \"frivolous complaints\" filed by members of the public-apparently referring to the genesis of the FEC and OCE inquiries.\n\nWhile those bodies act on outside complaints, DOJ has a higher bar for launching an investigation. (DOJ declined to comment for this article.)\n\nFor Bush, an ultra-progressive lawmaker first elected in 2020, the federal probe arrives at an especially inopportune time. While she represents a safely Democratic district, she is facing a well-funded primary challenge from Wesley Bell, a St. Louis prosecutor, in an election slated for August.\n\nIn her statement, Bush defended her security needs in the face of what she called \"relentless threats\" to her safety and life. She has previously shared the racist and sexist content of these threats publicly.\n\nBush's security spending, like that of many lawmakers, jumped sharply after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Afterward, the FEC-under pressure from the Republican Party-officially sanctioned the use of campaign funds for personal protection.\n\nAs a candidate in 2020, Bush reported spending about $55,000 on personal security. In 2021, when she first took office, her outlay leaped to around $234,000, with another increase the next year, to nearly $340,000-representing roughly one of every five dollars her campaign spent over those two years.\n\nIn 2023, the payments decreased a bit under OCE and media scrutiny, with only $150,000 in personal protection services through the end of September; her campaign will release its year-end numbers on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Bush's need for security is certainly greater than that of the typical lawmaker, other aspects of her response to the DOJ probe are more dubious.\n\nFor instance, Bush said in her statement that she has always paid her husband \"at or below a fair market rate\" for personal security.\n\nThat's a curious line of defense, in that federal campaigns and committees cannot accept below-market rates for services without triggering an \"in-kind contribution\" reporting requirement, because a special discount is viewed as a gift.\n\nWhen it comes to who was providing security for Bush beyond her husband, there is scant publicly available information.\n\nAnother top entity that received payment for security services was PEACE Security, which is based in St. Louis. In 2021, PEACE was paid $92,398 from Bush's campaign and in 2022 it was paid $225,281 for security services.\n\nPEACE's website is no longer available. A Facebook page for the group is still active, though there have been no posts since Nov. 9, 2023. The number listed on the site is still in service; when The Daily Beast called, the representative declined to comment.\n\nBush also paid thousands of dollars to a non-profit organization called DC Peace Team for \"security services.\"\n\nAccording to DC Peace Team's website, the group intends to \"cultivate the habits and skills of nonviolence in our communities, so we can better resist injustice, and thus, build a more sustainable just peace.\" Part of the group's work, it says, is \"deploying unarmed civilian protection units.\"\n\nA representative for DC Peace Team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBush also allocated at least some money from her taxpayer-funded official budget for security services-even though she flatly denied doing so in her statement.\n\nIn February 2021, she paid $880 to RS&T Security Consulting for security services; in April of that year, she paid $536 to Hackett Security Inc. for security services. In all of 2021, Bush also paid RS&T around $74,000 through her campaign, FEC filings show.\n\nRS&T owner Steven Revell told The Daily Beast in a phone call that he and his company are \"fully cooperating\" with the investigation and will be responsive and transparent regarding any inquiries from law enforcement.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Bush did not take questions from reporters about the investigation as she left the House floor. Her staff instructed reporters that she would do a press gaggle on the Capitol steps-but as reporters gathered around the congresswoman, she read a prepared statement on her phone that was similar to her initial statement, and left without taking questions.\n\nSenior Political Reporter\n\nRoger.Sollenberger@thedailybeast.com\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nriley.rogerson@thedailybeast.com\n\nreese.gorman@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Next Squad Member to Face Primary Is Already Behind in Poll\n\nWashington Bureau Chief\n\nOn the heels of the Tuesday defeat of the New York Democrat Jamaal Bowman , another prominent member of the progressive \"Squad\" in the U.S. House, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), had worrying news of her own: a poll showing her behind in her primary contest.\n\nFirst reported by Politico , the poll showed Bush at 42 percent support, one point behind challenger Wesley Bell, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney.\n\nThat was within the margin of error but there was another striking finding: Bell led by one point after trailing by 16 in the previous such survey, from January.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe pollster, The Mellman Group, said : \"Bush is still seen favorably, but assessments of her and her performance are moving in a negative direction, while Bell's image is improving, leaving him with an underlying image advantage.\n\n\"With some six weeks to go and 11% [of voters surveyed] still undecided, this race can go either way, but Bell has achieved a slight advantage.\"\n\nIn New York, Bowman's race went one way, firmly: The congressman was soundly beaten by George Latimer, the Westchester County executive.\n\nLatimer cast his victory as one for the center over the left.\n\nBowman has faced challenges on multiple issues, prominently including his misdemeanor guilty plea (and House censure ) for pulling a fire alarm in a congressional office building.\n\nNonetheless, the New York race was heavily influenced by Democratic splits over Israel and its war with Hamas , the issue emerging as a particular problem for Bowman given his policy positions , conspiracy-tinged remarks , and other embarrassments .\n\nSimilar splits affect Bush's race, in Missouri .\n\nPolitico noted the group that commissioned the new poll: Democratic Majority for Israel (DMI), of which Mark Mellman, CEO of the Mellman Group, is president.\n\nBut the site also noted that Mellman's polling in the Bowman-Latimer race proved accurate, giving Latimer a 17-point lead in April, the margin he went on to enjoy on election night.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bush issued a statement about Bowman's defeat.\n\nShe said : \"AIPAC and their allies-backed by far-right Donald Trump mega donors-poured a tidal wave of cash into this primary race showing us just how desperate these billionaire extremists are in their attempts to buy our democracy, promote their own gain, and silence the voices of progress and justice. There should be no question about the need to get Big Money out of politics.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Bush did not respond to a request for comment about the Mellman poll in her own race.\n\nBut in her statement, Bush continued: \"These same extremists are coming to St Louis. They are bankrolling a faux-progressive, former Republican campaign operative to buy our deep blue Democratic seat.\"\n\nThat was a reference to Bell's 2006 stint as campaign manager to a conservative Republican in the same Missouri district.\n\nAs he runs for office, Bell has said he wants to focus on issues closely related to the St. Louis constituency.\n\nRegarding Israel, his website says \"the only democracy and strongest American ally in the Middle East... was attacked by terrorists on October 7. I believe Israel has the right to defend itself and go after those who perpetrated those attacks. In Congress, I'll fight to make sure the United States remains Israel's strongest ally.\"\n\nBush supporters aren't buying. One, Hannah Rosenthal of Progressive Jews of St. Louis, told the Times : \"I don't see Wesley Bell as a progressive. His allegiance with AIPAC supporters is a prime example.\"\n\nAIPAC spent at least $14.5 million on Bowman's race, much of it after the Mellman poll showed Latimer with a commanding lead.\n\nOn Wednesday, an AIPAC spokesperson, Marshall Wittmann, told Axios : \"Pro-Israel activists are proud to engage in the democratic process and help elect candidates who stand with Israel as it battles Iranian terrorist proxies.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Election Day for Bush and Bell is Aug. 6, six weeks away.\n\nBush seems sure to face continued criticism over her pro-Palestinian positions as well as issues including a House ethics investigation over the alleged misuse of campaign funds.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mellman Strategies said: \"With 60 percent favorable toward Bush, and 31 percent unfavorable, Bush is not unpopular.\n\n\"But Bell's favorables are four points higher than Bush's and his unfavorables are nine points lower... This primary race is essentially tied but clearly moving in Wesley Bell's direction.\"\n\nWashington Bureau Chief\n\nmartin.pengelly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Cori Bush Reveals True Story Behind Her Abortion\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nCongresswoman Cori Bush has shared the story of her own abortion in its entirety for the first time, joining at least two other Democratic lawmakers who are expected to detail their abortions in stark testimony before a House Oversight Committee on reproductive rights on Thursday.\n\n\"When I was 17, I was raped, became pregnant, and got an abortion,\" she wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \"And I am not ashamed.\"\n\nBush disclosed her abortion earlier this month, at a reproductive rights rally on the steps of the Old Courthouse. Speaking to Vanity Fair this week, she disclosed the whole story.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTomorrow, I will share a story that I've never fully told publicly before. I am testifying at the Oversight Committee hearing on abortion care and I will share that when I was 17, I was raped, became pregnant, and got an abortion. And I am not ashamed. https://t.co/S7HT22NVvG\n\nIn the summer of 1994, a 17-year-old Bush attended an annual church trip from St. Louis to Jackson, Mississippi. She had just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, the only person she'd ever been sexually intimate with. A leader for the youth delegation trip, a man in his early twenties that the girls were all \"swooning over,\" invited her to hang out, she told Vanity Fair .\n\nIn her hotel room, the situation escalated uncomfortably quickly. She and the man were sitting on the bed, when \"all of a sudden we went from talking to, he was on top.\" The alleged assailant took her clothes off and penetrated her, Bush said. She couldn't process what was happening at the time, and didn't. The next day, he pretended it hadn't happened, she said.\n\nBush learned that she had become pregnant within weeks of the attack.\n\n\"Now I know that was a sexual assault. It's even hard for me to say a little bit, because I'm still really trying to process all of it,\" she said. \"I didn't see that as rape. I felt like I did something-I did something wrong.\"\n\nThe freshman Democratic lawmaker has become well known for successfully fighting to reinstate eviction freezes. Recently, she's turned her attention to attempts by state Republicans to outlaw abortions in Missouri.\n\nAt the Old Courthouse rally on Sept. 9, Bush appeared with Mayor Tishuara Jones to call for the protection of abortion care and the abolition of the filibuster.\n\nShe told her story there, according to The St. Louis American , saying that after she learned she was pregnant at 17, some family members ostracized her. \"She went through a lot,\" Bush said of herself, \"but services were available to treat her.\"\n\n\"That woman now stands before you as your United States Congresswoman,\" she added.\n\nVanity Fair reported that Bush thought she'd never go to college after her pregnancy. She felt defeated, and like she'd disappointed her parents. She asked a mutual friend to tell her rapist about the pregnancy-and he responded by laughing.\n\nBush booked an abortion through a number in the yellow pages. Then 18, she arrived at a local clinic, where her car was surrounded by angry anti-abortion protesters.\n\nHer experience became even more traumatic when she was forced to attend a \"hostile\" counseling session in order to undergo the procedure. The white woman counseling her told Bush her options were either abortion or welfare. It felt belittling and degrading.\n\nBush went ahead with the procedure, \"a very cold situation,\" and walked back to her car. The protesters were still there. \"I remember thinking... You're yelling at me, but you don't know my story,\" she recalled. \"You're not going to help me with this baby if I had the baby. I felt like there was no mercy, coming from people that didn't even know me.\"\n\nBush is one of at least three Democratic congresswomen expected to testify about their own abortions on Wednesday.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) told NBC News that she had an abortion in a back alley in Mexico before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.\n\n\"My mother's friend said, 'Look, I know a very good doctor. But he's in a back alley clinic in Mexico.' She says, 'I'm going to take care of her. You know, there are risks, but I know this doctor's reputation.' She said, 'If this is what she wants to do, I want to help,'\" she said.\n\n\"I was terrified. I didn't know what was taking place. And in fact, you know, I survived, and why it's so important now for me to tell the story is, I don't want any woman to ever have to go through that... I know what that back alley looked like. I know what that dark light looked like... I see it right now. I'm one of the fortunate ones.\"\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) told NBC she had an abortion after suffering postpartum depression that was so severe she contemplated suicide.\n\n\"I just realized that there was no way I could have another baby at that time, and that I could not go through what I had gone through,\" she said.\n\n\"I had gone through postpartum depression after [her first child] Janak's birth. I, you know, even contemplated suicide at one time. And I knew that I was not ready to go through that again, and that I needed to be strong for Janak. And so, I spoke to the person who became my husband, my loving partner at the time. He was completely supportive, and I decided to have an abortion.\"\n\nBush said she feels it's now more important than ever to speak up.\n\nReferring to her own state's abortion ban, which prohibits procedures without exception after eight weeks, Bush said, \"If we don't catch this, if we don't stop this, it's just gonna be more and more all across the country.\"\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\namanda.mcdougall@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Clay has represented the state's 1st Congressional District since 2001, when he succeeded his father as the district's representative. Bush edged out the veteran in Tuesday's vote, according to the Associated Press, with nearly 49 percent of the vote. She told supporters: \"They counted us out...

But St. Louis showed up today.\" Bush is now almost certain to become first Black woman to represent Missouri in Congress. She entered public life in 2014 after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager, in Ferguson, and has spent this summer at protests in the district following the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.\n\nNews Correspondent\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Cori Bush Is Taking on Congress' QAnon Kooks-and the White House\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nWhen maniacal insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, Rep. Cori Bush was, like many elected officials, \"sitting in our office in lockdown,\" fearful of what could come next. More than three weeks later, she says she is still not safe.\n\nConfronting the actualized threat of white supremacy from her new position in the House, Bush, a Black progressive Democrat from Missouri, immediately introduced a resolution to expel members who were potentially involved in planning or escalating the calamitous scene.\n\nSince then, she contends that the targeting has not subsided-even in the halls of Congress.\n\nOn Friday, Bush said that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene-a controversial Republican newcomer from Georgia who has expressed fondness for the baseless QAnon conspiracy-\" berated \" her in the hallway on Jan. 13, exactly one week after the deadly riot. Taylor Greene, in a tweet with an accompanying video, responded by calling Bush the leader of a \" terrorist mob .\"\n\n\"I was walking with my staff to vote,\" Bush said in a statement, recounting the experience. \"I was in the tunnel between the Cannon Office Building and the Capitol when Marjorie Taylor Greene came up from behind me, ranting loudly into her phone while not wearing a mask. This took place one day after multiple of my House colleagues announced they had tested positive for COVID-19 after being in a room with Taylor Greene during the white supremacist attack on the Capitol.\"\n\n\"Out of concern for the health of my staff, other members of Congress, and their congressional staff, I repeatedly called out to her to put on a mask. Taylor Greene and her staff responded by berating me, with one staffer yelling, 'Stop inciting violence with Black Lives Matter.'\"\n\nBush soon moved her office citing escalating safety concerns.\n\nFacing an extended period of intersecting racial, health, and economic crises, congressional progressives have identified Bush as an emerging leader to help shepherd Democrats through a time of grave unrest and urgent legislation. Three members-Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Mondaire Jones (D-NY)-told The Daily Beast that Bush is uniquely poised to push for reforms as a matter of practical necessity, citing her activism, medical acumen, and lived experience as a Black working class woman as valuable to advancing a left-aligned agenda.\n\n\"Cori has been a fighter her whole life,\" said Jones, a freshman Democrat. \"From literally saving lives as a nurse to leading protests for racial justice in Ferguson to raising kids by herself, it's no surprise to me that she's hit the ground running from day one.\"\n\nCori Bush leads protesters against police brutality after the death of George Floyd last summer.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast, Bush, 44, said that her early days in Washington are intrinsically linked to her personal story, which includes a rise to office after surviving domestic violence and economic hardship that led to a bout of homelessness . Detailing her tactical approach, Bush said she intends to regularly share some of those harsher lived realities to help members better understand Americans' daily battles, a mandate that is particularly crucial as President Joe Biden takes over from former President Donald Trump under tenuous conditions.\n\n\"That is why I wanted to come to Congress,\" Bush said over the phone on Thursday afternoon. \"Not just come in and fly under the radar just to have a title.\"\n\nThe expulsion resolution, Bush's first move in office, received dozens of co-signers. And Greene wasn't Bush's only target. She spent a significant portion of time demanding accountability for Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from her home state, who chose to go forward with a craven ploy to dispute the results of the presidential election even after the riot sparked by similar lies had ripped through the Capitol.\n\n\"[She] knows firsthand the challenges and struggles working people across our country face every day,\" said Pressley, a fellow \"Squad\" member. \"She understands the need for bold, systemic policies that match the scale and scope of the crises before us and deliver the long-overdue change our communities need and deserve.\"\n\nBush, along with allies like Pressley, are endeavoring to push Biden considerably to the left during his first 100 days in office. The president's decades-long resume shows a commitment to a centrist model of politics, and although he has promised to evolve into an FDR-esque version of himself to tackle the ongoing national crises, some on the left have already demonstrated a willingness to exert more pressure if he doesn't follow through with what they consider to be basic imperatives.\n\nStrategizing around that expectation, Bush said she has already seen some early successes. The day that Biden released his COVID-19 task force in early November , for example, she recalled reviewing the list of names and seeing several qualified doctors, but a total lack of nurses. At the time, she said officials from the Biden transition reached out for her input and she recommended, from the perspective of a registered nurse, that they add some nurses to the roster, explaining that they are the frontline workers typically in the closest contact with patients. Shortly after, the Biden transition team added an initial registered nurse to their unit.\n\nOn top of advocating for more coronavirus relief, Bush's early policy priorities are most closely centered around criminal justice and policing reforms, having endured a trio of police brutality, partner abuse, and sexual assault. \"Going through all of what I went through was pretty terrible,\" Bush said. \"The fact that I was able to come through it and I lived to tell the story and then do something about it, it is an honor.\"\n\n\"That voice has to be represented. And not just by one person,\" she said.\n\nBush first hit the streets with the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 to demand justice after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. Her mission to take that message to the Hill began two years later, first with an unsuccessful run for the Senate in 2016, followed by a bid for the House that also came up short during the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nDown two losses and up against a legacy fixture in Missouri politics, Bush's third attempt at elected office was the most challenging. She launched a bid against Rep. Lacy Clay, who took over the seat from his father, former Rep. Bill Clay. Laboriously rivaling the well-funded younger Clay, she amassed her own substantial fundraising haul from grassroots donors in 2020 and ultimately muscled her way through the party primary to be sworn-in on Jan. 3 the following year as the state's first Black congresswoman.\n\n\"What she represents and why she resonates so well with so many so quickly is that we are all, at some point, trying to figure out how we get active,\" said Kara Turrentine, a state director for Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) presidential campaign. \"At what point can we no longer just be Twitter warriors?\"\n\nAs the summer of global protests raged among multi-racial coalitions seeking justice and solidarity for George Floyd, another Black man killed at the hands of the police , Bush found herself at the center of an intense inter-party battle over messaging and optics. While Biden and those in the Democratic caucus condemned the murder of Floyd by a white police officer, most did not use the slogan \"defund the police,\" cautiously avoiding what they considered to be an activist-led phrase with an evolving definition.\n\nThe expression became particularly contentious in the aftermath of the elections, when some Democrats blamed the \"defund\" framework for down-ballot losses in suburban districts. Two prominent Biden allies, former Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA), who is now a senior White House official, and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) sought to justify their colleagues' defeats or near defeats over the use of the term by Republicans, establishing a clear line between their stance and Bush's.\n\nBush, on the other hand, embraced the term during her rise to power, offering a more nuanced meaning of what giving fewer resources to police departments could look like in practice. In the most basic interpretation of her view, it's simply a \"mandate\" for ensuring that Black and brown people are not senselessly killed. In one notable instance, Bush bucked the party orthodoxy by publicly criticizing former President Barack Obama after he said that using \" snappy \" slogans like \"defund\" was a way to lose \" a big audience .\" She responded by naming individuals killed by excessive police force, including Brown and Breonna Taylor, whose name was emblazoned on the mask she wore at orientation for new members.\n\n\"[She] knows what it means to be unhoused, uninsured, to survive domestic violence and police brutality,\" said Omar, a second-term congresswoman who is no stranger to inter-party controversy, herself. \"She was in the streets fighting for change in Ferguson, and now she is in the halls of power changing the narrative of what is possible.\"\n\nCori Bush addresses the media after voting during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAlong with Omar, Bush pushed immediately for Trump to be impeached for the second time following the insurrection. Democrats coalesced around that position, ultimately led by three more senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, and made the former president the only one in history to face that distinct fate twice. During the impeachment proceedings, she unabashedly called Trump the \" white supremicist in chief ,\" further drawing boos from Republican members.\n\nEntering politics from a working class background, Bush attributes her early traction to a willingness to be \"vulnerable\" in difficult conversations. Asked about what most surprised her early on, she mentioned being shocked by how fully was embraced by members of her caucus.\n\n\"The way that I perceived it and a lot of others perceived me entering Congress was that people would not like me, I would be on my own,\" Bush said. \"That has not been the case at all.\"\n\nHer colleagues' desires to collaborate was further borne out on Thursday, when she introduced a new piece of environmental legislation with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) that seeks to reach beyond the traditional thinking around the issue by including a police violence provision.\n\nOn a practical level, progressive activists and strategists point to the importance of having someone from the outside now effectively working within the system to translate national concerns. Members are often criticized for being aloof to the needs of those who they are elected to represent. There's a hope that Bush and this new wave of progressives will be different.\n\n\"There's a level of urgency when you're living it,\" said Maurice Mitchell, national director at the Working Families Party, which supported Bush's bid. \"She ran as an insurgent, she didn't run getting insider support getting major donor support, so when she goes back to her district or when she's on the Hill, she's unencumbered by the interests of those folks that allows her to be able to speak her mind.\"\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nHanna.Trudo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Cori Bush (D-MO) \"could never have a job in the real world\" because she's simply \"not smart enough\" to hold one.\n\nOf course, the fact that Bush has had several \"real world\" jobs went unmentioned by the frozen fish fortune heir who has spent the last twenty years failing up in the cable news world.\n\nDuring Tuesday's broadcast of his Fox News primetime show, Carlson latched onto the conservative outrage over Bush and other progressives issuing critical statements on Independence Day. Bush, in particular, drew intense backlash from the right for tweeting that \"this land is stolen land and Black people still aren't free.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nClaiming \"some of our elected leaders\" spent the Fourth of July weekend \"reminding you that the country isn't worth anything\" and an \"awful place not worth defending,\" Carlson then took direct aim at Bush-continuing his frequent habit of viciously insulting women of color.\n\n\"Missouri Congresswoman Cori Bush, for example-someone who could never have a job in the real world because she's not smart enough for a real job, complained that her taxpayer-funded gig is really a form of slavery,\" the Fox News star exclaimed.\n\n\"Cori Bush, however, is free to say stupid things on Twitter as much as she wants. And draw a federal paycheck! And draw lifetime benefits for her job wrecking the country that she hates,\" he continued after reading aloud her tweet.\n\nAfter highlighting a similar tweet from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), another Black congresswoman who has been a favorite target of Carlson's , the conservative host went on to ask fellow Fox News host Jesse Watters why the minority lawmakers \"want you to dislike\" America.\n\n\"So the people who run the country are telling us two things,\" Carlson added. \"One, the country is not worth having and it's terrible and, two, despite being the most powerful people in the country, they are oppressed. How should we interpret this?\"\n\nReiterating comments he made earlier in the day , Watters dismissed Bush's assertion that America was \"stolen land\" from Native Americans, saying \"we won this land on the battlefield and the rest we purchased from the Europeans.\"\n\nHe added: \"Are we supposed to give the Dakotas back to Crazy Horse's family? Are we supposed to give California back to Mexico?\"\n\nDespite Carlson's claims to the contrary, Bush-who is in her first few months as a congresswoman- is a registered nurse who went on to work as a nursing supervisor and was also a pastor of a St. Louis-area church.\n\nCarlson, on the other hand, has jokingly bragged in the past that he's \"extraordinarily loaded\" from his trust fund and doesn't need to work. Furthermore, despite both CNN and MSNBC canceling his shows and firing him, Fox News hired Carlson in 2009. After serving as a weekend morning co-host for a few years, he was eventually rewarded with yet another show in 2016.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

Bush, a member of the progressive \"Squad,\" is one of the most outspoken advocates for Palestine in Congress, and the powerful pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC has poured over $8 million into the race in an effort to defeat her. \"It's all meant to push out someone who stands up for Palestinian rights,\" says Michael Berg, a Bush supporter, whose recent essay in The Nation is titled \"I'm a St. Louis Jew. Here's Why I'm Backing Cori Bush.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nToday is Primary Day in Missouri. One of the most closely watched races of the year, Democratic Congressmember Cori Bush is facing off against county prosecutor Wesley Bell. AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and an affiliated super PAC have spent over $8 million in an effort to defeat Bush, who has been a vocal critic of Israel's war on Gaza. The election comes just weeks after the same super PAC , United Democratic Project, spent over $14 million to help defeat New York Congressmember Jamaal Bowman in his Democratic primary here in New York.\n\nFour years ago, Cori Bush won a stunning primary upset over the 10-term incumbent Congressmember William Lacy Clay Jr. in Missouri's 1st Congressional District in the St. Louis area. Bush was a leader in the 2014 Ferguson uprising over the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Prior to taking office, she worked as a nurse. She was also unhoused for a period of time with her children, an experience that led her to become a leading housing advocate in Congress, where she introduced the Unhoused Bill of Rights.\n\nWe go right now to St. Louis. We're joined by Michael Berg, former political director of the Missouri chapter of the Sierra Club. He has a new piece for The Nation headlined \"I'm a St. Louis Jew. Here's Why I'm Backing Cori Bush. If AIPAC and its donors defeat her, we won't just be losing one of Palestine's staunchest allies but also one of the climate movement's most effective champions.\"\n\nMichael Berg, welcome to Democracy Now! Explain what's happening in St. Louis now with this massive amount of money that's being put in to defeat Congressmember Bush.\n\nMICHAEL BERG : Thank you, Amy.\n\nYes, if you're in St. Louis and you live here, over the last several weeks, couple months, you look at YouTube, you will see an advertisement either against Cori Bush, a lot of them against Cori Bush, or for Wesley Bell. You go to your television, you hear that. You go to the radio. You get mailers. There's been - I've talked to people who have had over 40 mailers, either anti-Bush or pro-Bell, coming in. It's just this incredible infusion of money and resources in attacking Bush, in supporting Dell.\n\nAnd it's interesting because, as you mentioned, the money is coming from AIPAC , but the attacks have nothing to do with her principled stance for a ceasefire. They're about other very, very misleading attacks on her coming in. And it's all meant to push out someone who stands up for Palestinian rights, but who stands up for so many other things. But it's very duplicitous for this organization to come in and have the money for one reason, and have all these ads that are misleading for other reasons.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Michael, what's been the stance of the existing Democratic Party machinery, which normally backs an incumbent?\n\nMICHAEL BERG : Well, if you look at the national level, you know, Cori Bush is backed by Hakeem Jeffries and the leadership in Congress, the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus. I mean, you have Democrats in the state of Missouri, in the area, who are on both sides of this race. So I can't say there's a unified response, but there is a - you know, the union movement, most unions are supporting Bush. She has voted with the AFL - CIO almost 100% of the time. There's trades have been on the other side, but the other unions have not. So, I'd say there's been people on different sides.\n\nBut the primary thing happening is just this incredible infusion of AIPAC money that's sort of washed - like, just dominated the airwaves. And people keep hearing it, and people keep hearing it and seeing it. And I've hit a lot of doors, knocked a lot of doors, and it has its effect. Misleading statements about her record as far as the infrastructure bill, where she made a principled stance to hold out for - to make sure there's a child tax credit, to make sure we had more climate provisions - a stance that was taken in 2021 where she stood up and she took a vote. And in the 2022 election, almost nobody heard about it. But here, in the 2024 election, just the airwaves and the mailers are just hammering, hammering, saying she didn't stand up for your job, she didn't stand up for clean air and water. And there's nothing further from the truth. She was standing up many times as much.\n\nAnd what I found is, you know, I knock on doors, and people have heard these things. And you talk to them, and they say, \"Oh, I don't support her anymore, because she didn't do this.\" And when you explain that, no, she was holding out to get more resources for your children, to make sure we much more further confronted the climate crisis, and the only reason you're hearing about it now is because she stood up for peace in the Middle East, for a ceasefire, for children to stop being killed with American weapons, and that because of that, you have millions of dollars coming heavily from the same donors who backed Trump, Vance and Senator Hawley. When you let people know that, and that you say, \"Why are you hearing so much about this? It's because people don't want her there,\" you flip the vote. People then support her again, but the problem being, you know: Who's got the capacity to go to every door and have a 5- to 10-minute conversation? You know, the barrage of misinformation works. And, you know, we're hopeful. We're hoping we can counteract it. But it's been - never seen anything like it.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what about Wesley Bell? He's the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney. He previously served on the City Council and was instrumental in policy changes after the police killing of Michael Brown. What's been the sentiment of voters toward him? But do people even really know him?\n\nMICHAEL BERG : A lot of people know him. I mean, it's different. St. Louis has confusing jurisdictions. So, St. Louis County is outside of St. Louis city. So, he's the prosecutor for St. Louis County. The district, Cori Bush's district, is about half the city of St. Louis and half parts of St. Louis County. People know him.\n\nAnd I would say, you know, what is disturbing to me is he told Congresswoman Bush that he was not going to run. He told her that. He was running against Josh Hawley, our senator, who is not very popular in this district. And he said he was running against him. And then, when he was offered a deal to get millions of dollars of AIPAC money, he did a 180 and decided to take on, you know, an incumbent progressive Democrat, who's just been a champion, as I mention in my article, for the climate, for so many things that people care about in this area.\n\nSo, I would call him an opportunist who saw an opportunity to go to Congress, while Cori Bush is in it because she wants to represent the interests of ordinary people, the people who are suffering, people who are unhoused. Before she came into office, she was constantly on the streets helping folks who were unhoused, making sure people had resources, food and shelter, when need be. So, I see a clear distinction there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Michael Berg, I want to thank you so much for being with us, St. Louis Jewish supporter of Cori Bush, former political director of the Missouri chapter of the Sierra Club. We'll link to your piece in The Nation , \"I'm a St. Louis Jew. Here's Why I'm Backing Cori Bush.\" And, of course, we'll report on the results of the election, the primary, tomorrow.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Biden vowed to enshrine access to abortion into law if Democrats can expand their narrow majorities in Congress in the upcoming midterm, now less than three weeks away.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Here's the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill that I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade . And when Congress passes it, I'll sign it in January, 50 years after Roe was first decided the law of the land.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden spoke at a Democratic National Committee event as many Democratic candidates hope to harness voter outrage over the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson last year that struck down the constitutional right to an abortion after almost 50 years and left it up to the states. Abortion rights were a key issue at Tuesday night's debate in Florida between Republican Senator Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Congressmember Val Demings.\n\nSEN . MARCO RUBIO : I'm 100% pro-life. ... That said, every bill I've ever sponsored on abortion, every bill I've ever voted for, has exceptions.\n\nREP . VAL DEMINGS : Senator, how gullible do you really think Florida voters are? Number one, you have been clear that you support no exceptions, even including rape and incest.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we spend the rest of the hour with Congressmember Cori Bush. She herself faces reelection this November as a first-term Democrat in Missouri, where abortion was banned after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. She just wrapped up a \"Roe the Vote: Reproductive Freedom Tour\" across her state and was one of 17 congressmembers arrested in a pro-abortion rights protest outside the Supreme Court in July. She first publicly discussed her own abortions as a witness at a congressional hearing last year and has featured her story in campaign ads like this one.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : At 17, I was raped and became pregnant. That's the start of my abortion story. Millions more have their own. Let me be clear: Forced pregnancy is a crime against humanity. When an extremist court dictates what we can do with our bodies, that's violence. But together, St. Louis, we're powerful. Together, we'll reclaim our rights. We will not let up. We will not yield until abortion is legal everywhere and everyone has reproductive freedom.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Cori Bush has just published her memoir. It's called The Forerunner: A Story of Pain and Perseverance in America . She's joining us today to discuss it, as she talks about her experiences with abortion, her work as a community activist. She was a registered nurse and ordained pastor. She was unhoused, and so much more.\n\nCongressmember Bush, welcome back to Democracy Now!\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Thanks for having me.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your book is riveting. Why don't we start by you talking about abortion? You openly talk about it in Congress. But you're not just talking about one; you're talking about having had several abortions. And you take on a very sensitive issue. It's the issue of choice, when you have a choice to have an abortion or not. And you can talk about what happened in your life.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yeah. You know, the decision should belong to the person who has to walk out that journey. It shouldn't be our government making that decision for anyone. And I look at it the same as, you know, you choose whether to go to a provider if you are a diabetic. You make the choice: Do I want to go to this particular doctor or that one? You know, for those who are insured and for those who are underinsured or uninsured, there is a different choice that they have to make. Well, when we're talking about our physical body, we're talking about our mental health, that should be the sole decision of the person that walks that out.\n\nSo, I've been upfront and very public about the two abortions that I've had, and, you know, the first one being very difficult. I didn't even understand what was happening at the time. I didn't understand how I got pregnant. Even when I - I just - the whole thing, I just was not prepared for. But being able to, at 17, go to this book - you know, at that time, we still had the big fat yellow pages. I remember I went to that, to the yellow pages, and went to the name of a clinic that I had heard my friends talk about. I opened the yellow pages. There was the phone number. I called, made an appointment. And it was just that simple to be able to be on the road to receiving services. It was just like calling my dentist to say I needed - you know, I had a toothache.\n\nBut I think about what happens when the services that we need for our bodies, if you take those services away. Right now we're fighting. We've been fighting for such a long time just to make sure that each and every person has access in actual healthcare. We've been fighting for a long time to make sure that there was reproductive justice, not just reproductive freedom. And now that has been rolled back to where our rights are being stripped away. If you don't want an abortion, don't have one. But to say that no one in this country should have that type of access, that, to me, to strip away those rights, should not be the job of the government.\n\nAnd, you know, prior to Roe v. Wade being law, we know that one of the, like, major causes of death for Black women in this country was the sepsis that went along with unsafe - that came from unsafe abortions. Why do we want to go back there, when we know that there are so many disparities in Black maternal health, disparities just across the board? We haven't fixed those problems. We can't go backwards.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Congressmember, I wanted to ask you - you begin your book with an ode to your beloved hometown, St. Louis, Missouri. You write, quote, \"Despite [this] richness of culture, the truth is that we live in a lethal environment in St. Louis, and we're dying.\" And you go on to say, quote, \"The legacies of slavery and de jure segregation affect every aspect of society here.\" Could you elaborate?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Sure. I mean, St. Louis, we've been - you know, we're known for leading in homicides across the country per capita, you know, year after year. We're known for even leading in the murder of children. We are known for leading in police murder, year after year. So, we live in this lethal environment, but also environmental justice is something that we have not - like, we have not achieved environmental justice.\n\nJust right now we have this issue in our community. We've been fighting this battle for years to clean up Cold Water Creek and West Lake Landfill. We have a school that's been in the news over the past couple of days, an elementary school, where there are - where a study just came out saying that there's radioactive waste within the school. And just yesterday, the school board had to make the decision - the school board made the decision to close the school and go virtual. We're talking about an environment where people should be able to live and thrive and grow, but we're fighting just to survive.\n\nAnd as much as I love my community, I love St. Louis, you know, we have to talk about those things and address them. We have to address poverty head on. We have to - you know, I think about how we drive up and down the streets of St. Louis, and there are certain areas where the auction blocks used to be. When you bring up - brought up slavery, a lot of people don't know that Missouri was a slave state. Even though we are not the South, we are the Midwest, we were still a slave state. And I think about the case of Dred Scott, and Dred and Harriet Scott. I think about how that we still feel - we are still up under, like, that cloud of the segregation, that cloud of slavery, that divided this state long ago. And we have not - we just haven't gotten to the point to where there is true equity and equality in the state or in the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Your book also talks about your family history. Your paternal great-grandparents came to St. Louis from Mississippi as part of the Great Migration. And you talk a lot about your father, Errol Bush, who was a giant in your life. Could you talk about him and what he taught you?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yeah. So, my dad, he's very much so, like, involved in making sure that we understand our family history, that we know who we are. He started that when we were kids. He made sure that I knew that, you know, I am enough, that my Black is beautiful. You know, we went through a lot. You know, like, colorism is a real thing, but my father made sure - colorism and racism are real things. My father made sure that we understood that, you know, the safety that you have here inside this home is different once you walk outside of these doors. So he built us up, you know, to know that you can go as far as you want to go; you can have all of the things you want to have; it's up to you if you allow other people to stop you. And so, he made sure we understood, like, responsibility and leadership, accountability. That was his mantra every single morning before we walked out of the doors to go to school.\n\nMy dad has been in politics for most of my life, so more than 30 years. But I remember, as a child, when he first got into politics, he started with the PTA and then moved on to, like, the city council and then became a mayor. I just remember that, you know, I worked on every part of my dad's campaigns, year after year. He would have to run every two years. And, I mean, we did it all. I was the - I just did it all - didn't know what I was doing, but I was there to support my dad. And looking back, those were seeds being sown that I didn't know that I would need, you know, later on in life.\n\nAnd now it's funny, because I was at all of my dad's functions and supporting him, holding the signs, wearing the shirts, doing all the stuff, and now my dad is doing that exact same thing for me. You cannot stop my dad from wearing his purple \"Cori Bush for Congress\" T-shirt and, you know, making sure everybody knows: Vote for my daughter.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about your protest to stop evictions? You yourself were unhoused, with your two beloved children. You're a registered nurse. You came out of the Black Lives Matter movement, dealing with the terrible police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Talk about how that history informed your strategies and how you decided that - though your father was in electoral politics, that you were going to go from movement to electoral politics. And do you see a difference?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yeah. So, that was not a decision that - first, it didn't come easy. I never had a desire to be a politician, never wanted to be an elected official. It was not at all a dream of mine. I wanted to be a nurse. That's what I saw. That's what I wanted to be. And especially because I worked so closely with my dad, and I would watch how my dad would say something, and then in the media, like in a newspaper article, they would print something that was not what my dad said, or people would attack him for things that he didn't do. And I just remember, like, just I would ask him, like, \"Why do you do this? Like, why do you continue to help people and do all of these things and give all of your time, and then you get all of these attacks and all of this criticism back?\" And I didn't understand it then.\n\nBut it was through the protest, through more than 400 days of protest during the Ferguson uprising, us being out there on the streets demanding what we thought was justice - now I consider justice being alive, not just - not someone going - not a police officer or anyone else going to jail. That's more accountability. That's not justice, to me, in my eyes. But, you know, we were out there just doing what we could to not only bring accountability, but to also be able to save other lives.\n\nSo, when someone approached me - and I write about it in the book. Someone approached me, another activist, and said, \"We need you to run for U.S. Senate. Like, will you run for U.S. Senate?\" I'm like, \"No. Like, why would I do that, after 400 days of protest?\"\n\nNow, I do remember being out there, though, looking for our elected officials, looking for more of them, I'll say, to be out there on the ground, to stand with us, because we weren't there to - just to piss people off and to block traffic and to be seen. Like, that's not why we were out there. We were out there because, for me, I didn't what my son to be the next hashtag, I didn't want my daughter to be the next hashtag, and I didn't do everything in my power to stop it. If throwing my voice, lending my voice, my hands, my feet to the moment was something that I could do, I needed to do everything that I could.\n\nBut when someone asked me to run, you know, in the beginning, I said, \"No. Like, why would I do that?\" But then, the more I thought about it, and I thought about all the times when I felt like I was just shouting at the wind, when I felt like I was throwing pebbles at the ocean and no one was there, I thought about, \"Hey, if you put someone in the space to be able to hit the ball\" - like, thinking about the St. Louis Cardinals. It was like, you know, you have this - you got a pitcher throwing these balls. Who's there to hit the home run? You know. And so, I said yes.\n\nBut that was not easy, because the other part of that was, \"Oh, you're just a nurse. Oh, you don't come from money. Oh, you're not an attorney. Do you realize you're an activist from Ferguson?\" Like, you know, people would call me a terrorist. Like, that was - that's what people saw, or, \"Oh, your skin is too dark. Like, you realize that, you know, Black women can't run for this seat. You know, your hair is unprofessional. Your hips are too big. Your lips are too big.\" Like, I went through all of those things trying to run for office in this state.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Congressmember, in your book, you talk about your early experiences with police as a teenager, and you write, quote, \"My friends and I were being initiated into the attacks that came to shape our teenage years and beyond.\" You were talking about being sexually harassed by a police officer. Could you talk about that?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yeah. You know, not knowing - like, waking up one day, and your body looks different. You put on the same clothes, and they don't fit you the same way. You know, I didn't - it got to the point to where I was like, you know, \"How do I dress? Like, am I doing - am I doing something wrong?\" Because now all of a sudden I have all of these men, these grown men, like, making these catcalls at me.\n\nAnd then this one particular day, this police officer just - you know, I'm walking down the street. I walked a lot, because that was just how I got around. And just I'm walking down the street, and this police officer pulls up in the car next to me. And I kept walking, but I didn't think anything - you know, that there would be a problem, because I knew most of the police officers, or at least they knew who we were. And we were taught that those police officers were safe. Like, you know, so I had no - I just assumed that this person was safe. But he was riding alongside me, and I kept walking. And I just remember, as he kept talking to me and when I finally looked in the car, I noticed, you know, he was making - he had this hand gesture going. And when I finally looked, because I had never experienced that before, I had never seen - you know, I had only changed kids' diapers, you know, so I had never seen a grown man's penis before. And that was - and I had never seen someone masturbating right in front of me. I was a kid.\n\nAnd so I internalized it. I didn't even go home and tell my dad, because I felt like I was wrong. You know, I was able to get away from that person, but I felt like I did that, like it was something that I did wrong. It was something - maybe it was the way that I was walking, you know, or maybe this shirt was too tight or my skirt should have been looser. Like, I felt like I was the problem, so I didn't want to tell my dad about that, because the police officer, he couldn't have been wrong. And if he was, how do I tell my dad that, as someone who really supports them? At least locally, anyway.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you also talk about the just horrifying moment where a faith leader rapes you. You have chosen to go public with these stories - you describe them in graphic detail - as a lesson. And can you talk about what happened next? I mean, you were a nurse. You were raped in your nurse's uniform.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yes, yes. So, in the book, I write about some other, some prior sexual assaults. And for 20 years, I held onto those, thinking, \"You know what? It was because my shirt was too short, or it was because my shorts were too short, or, you know, I was at this club, or, like, it was - there was something that I did to make this person think that that's what I wanted.\"\n\nAnd then, but fast-forward 20 years later, I'm 40 years old, had just lost my primary, my very first primary, running for U.S. Senate and was trying to - I was grieving that loss. And I was just going to - we got the news that a friend of ours, my protest brother, had been killed that morning. So, our protest family, they were out at the site where his body was found burned, shot in a car. And I was grieving that during - all day long and went to go see this home, because I knew I just needed to move. I was having so many problems where I lived. I didn't feel safe. I didn't feel safe having my children in that home, because of all of the surveillance, all of the attacks, all of - just all that was happening.\n\nAnd so I went to see this home of someone who I thought that I knew, that just said, \"Hey, you can come see it.\" They put it out on social media, on Facebook: \"Come out and see, you know, if you want to see the home that I have for rent.\" I went, just thought I was going to, you know, see this house that he had for rent. I went straight from work. I had on a white - my uniform. It was the uniform, the white scrub top with the brown - the blue - I'm sorry - scrub pants, and I had on some boots, some, like, Nike boots.\n\nAnd I wasn't there but minutes, when he grabbed me and led me to the bedroom. And I just remember him pulling my clothes down. And I still - it wasn't - I wasn't understanding what was happening, because I'm like, \"I know that's not what's happening. You know, I know\" - and then the violence started, you know, because I wasn't acting right. You know, I wasn't complying. And so, then that's when the violence started, and he had to just keep pushing me down. And he was just pulling at my clothes. And at that moment, I'm thinking, like, \"What did I do this time? Like, I - what? You know, like, I'm not exposed. I'm not like - what did I do?\"\n\nBut, you know, so that was - that one hit me really, really hard, and it knocked me down for several months. I could not - I was hypervigilant. I was suffering through moments of dissociation and a lot - I was  having trouble even taking care of myself, taking care of my children. I had to have family and friends to help me, because I could not even walk outside of my home. Like, part of my therapy was to step outside of my home for five minutes, then go for 10 minutes, then - like, I was not - I was not OK after that.\n\nAnd the other thing is, because this person was a pastor in this community, you know, and then it was like something - people not believing, like, \"Oh, why would a pastor do this to you?\" I was laying in the hospital right after it happened, laying in a hospital bed with people looking over me right after my rape kit, right after they did this horrific rape kit. The rape kit is not an easy thing to go through. Right after that, I'm laying there, and I have people looking over me, looking for my bruises, people looking over me, like, \"Well, he's a pastor, though. Why would he do that?\" Ask him!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And yet - go ahead, Juan.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yes, I wanted to ask you if you could talk about the Michael Brown killing and your involvement in the Ferguson protests. You write that your time as part of a mobile response team expanded your understanding of the public health impacts of policing and violence.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yeah. So, after - when Michael Brown was killed, a couple days later, I was back at work. That was that Monday; it happened on a Saturday. I was back at work that Monday, and I was telling my supervisor, like, \"Hey, you know, we should be on the ground. You know, like, people out there need help. Maybe we could - you know, you could send some folks to just be out there on the ground.\" I didn't think that they would send a whole van and a mobile response team, but that's what they ended up doing. And we organized everything, was out on the ground immediately, set up tents. We worked with Better Family Life. We collaborated. And we -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember, we have 30 seconds.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yes. And it was a time when I was able to see what happens when people don't have access to true care, and what also happens when we - when everybody doesn't feel safe in their community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, your story is a truly remarkable one. You became the first African American woman to represent Missouri in Congress. And you've written about it in this incredibly brave book, The Forerunner: A Story of Pain and Perseverance in America . Cori Bush, our guest. We thank you so much for being with us.\n\nThat does it for our show.

Bush tells Democracy Now! she could not \"walk away from this situation and go on vacation\" knowing that millions of people could end up on the streets. \"This isn't easy. This is not performative in any way. I would rather be at home, but I understand the urgency and the need of this crisis right now,\" Bush says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn now to Congressmember Cori Bush, who represents Missouri's 1st Congressional District and has been sleeping on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with others since Friday night to protest her House colleagues adjourning for August recess without passing an extension on the eviction moratorium for renters, as nearly 12 million people are behind on rent. Congressmember Bush was formerly unhoused with her children. Her recent piece in Time magazine is headlined \"I Lived in My Car and Now I'm in Congress. We Need to Solve America's Housing Crisis.\"\n\nLast week, Congressmember Bush introduced the Unhoused Bill of Rights, which she describes as \"the first-ever federal legislation to declare the civil and human rights of unhoused individuals, particularly the right to sit, stand, sleep, or eat in public without fear of harassment or criminalization.\"\n\nEarlier today, Congressmember Bush tweeted, \"5 AM. This morning felt cold, like the wind was blowing straight through my sleeping bag. Since Friday-when some colleagues chose early vacation over voting to prevent evictions-we've been at the Capitol. It's an eviction emergency. Our people need an eviction moratorium. Now.\"\n\nShe joins us from those same Capitol steps. Congressmember Bush, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about why you've been sleeping on the steps for days now.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : You know, the idea that lawmakers, the only ones - lawmakers, our government, the levels of government that have some type of jurisdiction with this type of a situation, with this crisis, chose not to do anything to stop this from becoming a crisis, on top of all of the crises we have going on in the country right now. I'm out here because there is no organization that can make this decision to have this moratorium in place. There is no - there's no corporation. You know, there's no, like, big-named family. There's no wealthy person. There's none of that, that can make the decision to make sure that between 7 and 11 million people don't end up forced out of their homes. That is solely on the people in Congress, or, what we've been messaging, the White House and CDC working together in collaboration to get this done. And because that didn't happen on last Friday, the House did not get that done, I could not at all walk away from this situation and go on vacation, recess, knowing that millions of people could start to end up on the streets. So, we just - I did what I know to do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about what it is you know to do.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : You know, I am an activist. I'm an organizer. I got my start, my official start, I guess I'd say, in activism after Michael Brown's murder in Ferguson in 2014. And we protested more than 400 days. And even after that, we protested - we've protested for years against injustices related to police brutality and more, and even the housing crisis. There was no way that I can do that work at home in St. Louis and then come here and see an atrocity taking place, that I have a hand in, and just sit by and let it go.\n\nSo, this is what I asked for. I asked for the people of St. Louis to send me here to be able to represent them, every single one of them. And I asked them to send me here to bring the same energy that I had on the streets of Ferguson all of those nights, bring that here in Congress.\n\nAnd so that's what I did. I know how to go ahead and say, \"Look, I'm going to protest this decision. I'm going to protest something that I know if we don't do anything, people will be hurt.\" And so that's what we did. And we brought two chairs and set them on the steps and took a picture and posted it out and said, \"Hey, we're here. You know, come and join us.\" And people did. And we've been here since Friday night.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were joined by several congressmembers, is that right, Friday night? Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, all slept out on the steps?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yes, yes, slept on the steps. And let me just say that it's not comfortable. We cannot lay. There is a law here that you cannot lay down on the Capitol steps. So we have to sit up in a chair or sit up on the steps. So that's how we slept, sitting up. And we've done that every night since.\n\nAnd it gets cold at night. It was really cold last night. Last night, I feel, was the coldest night since we've been out here. It was raining back and forth. And so, to have other members out here at night - Representative Mondaire Jones came out here last night. We have to have more bodies, more congressmembers to show up.\n\nThis is the thing: We can't take the glory if we're not willing to go through the grind. There is grind happening right now. So go through the grind. Don't just start snatching glory.\n\nBecause let me tell you this: this is not - this isn't easy. This is not performative in any way. I would rather be at home, but I understand the urgency and the need of this crisis right now. And so, my body, it hurts physically. I am walking slow, and I lost my voice. It's just starting to come back. I've got a lot of honey on board right now and a lot of tea. I'm dizzy, I'm lightheaded. You know, I am so - I'm exhausted, emotionally and mentally. But it is nothing in comparison to what our unhoused community members face every single day, and what would happen if we send 7 to 11 million people out on the street.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how did this happen, Congressmember Bush? I mean, we're not talking about a Republican-led House; we're talking about a Democratic-led House. Nancy Pelosi went home to her house. How did - she's the House speaker. How did this happen? This eviction moratorium was extended several times before, but now Congress just went out on recess? And what are you saying Pelosi should be able to do right now? What do you demand of President Biden?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Our message has been clear for the last four days now, that we're not just talking to one particular group or one particular person, saying, \"Hey, you need to act,\" because it's such an urgent situation. So we're saying everybody that has - everybody. We need to use all the tools in our toolbox right now. So we've been saying to House leadership, \"Reconvene the House. Reconvene us.\" Chairman Jim McGovern of the House Rules Committee came here to the steps, addressed the crowd, and he said that the Rules Committee is waiting. They are ready to come back and do the work. He said we will be back in a nanosecond if we hear that we have 218 votes. So they're ready.\n\nAnd so, we are saying, \"Reconvene us. Let's do the work to make sure that we get the whip count right, and then come back and let us get this vote.\" Also, we're still saying to the White House and to the CDC , you know, \"Give us the moratorium. Give us the eviction moratorium.\" We're asking the president to pen the executive order. We need that done. And if there is a court challenge after that, we can deal with the court. That court challenge can be dealt with. In the meantime, though, while that is happening, if it happens, we will be able to, in the House, work on getting the bill that Chairwoman Maxine Waters has introduced, which extends - which has a moratorium until December the 31st. It's just a must.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what about Pelosi calling on the CDC to extend the moratorium?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Again, we have to use everything that we can. That was the route that she chose, was to say the CDC . We're saying CDC , White House, House leadership. We're even talking about the Senate. Come on. Like, we were all elected to serve the people. We didn't sign up to say, \"Oh, not people of low income. No, no, no, no. We're not talking about you.\" We didn't - there was no document that I saw. And when I raised my hand, that was not a part of what I swore. So, my job is to make sure that I'm speaking up for the over 740,000 people in my district, to make sure that their basic needs are met, plus anything else that's coming up that is within my wheelhouse to take care of. And the same thing for each and every one of the people that you just named, they have to do their work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Bush, can you talk about the Unhoused Bill of Rights, this unprecedented bill that you've just introduced?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Sure. The Unhoused Bill of Rights is a resolution that - it lays out what those civil rights protections, what dignity looks like for our unhoused neighbors. We need to make sure that - because what we've seen is that the protections for our community members who are experiencing homelessness is - it just doesn't seem like it's respected at all. And this has been going on for such a long time, and it's going on everywhere. And so, we decided to build a framework so that we can build legislation from this.\n\nWe want to make sure that we're talking about every single thing that affects someone who is living unhoused, from hostile architecture, which I think is absolutely - I just can't believe who comes up with these things, to want to take the bus stop bench and make it to where you can't lay down on it. You know, those type of things. It's unbelievable. And I think about when I was unhoused, when I was sleeping in a car, the one thing that I did have was the car.\n\nAnd I never went into a shelter. I didn't take my children into a shelter, because I felt like at least I have a car. You know, I have a place where we can at least lean back, where they can lay down. What about people who don't have that? You know, when I think about last night, we were subject to everything that the weather decided to do. We couldn't do - that was it. We were subject to the rain, the harsh downpours, the cold, the wind, all of that, and then the heat right now.\n\nAnd so, making sure that people who are unhoused have access to restrooms - going to the restroom is a huge deal. Where do you go to the restroom? Think about how many times you go to the restroom in a day, and having a place to go. But when you are unhoused and you have to go to the restroom, you go into a store. They want you to buy something before you can use the restroom, you know, and just to clean up yourself. You can't walk in and look a particular way and expect them to allow you to just use the facilities. So, this Bill of Rights says that the rights of every single person who is living unhoused, every person who's experiencing homelessness, that their rights should be protected. They should have the same dignity of anyone who is living housed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, your story alone, Congressmember Bush, as you describe in the Time magazine piece, and as you were speaking just now, you lived in your car with your infant - right? - 6 months old, and your next child, not so much older. How did you go from being unhoused, living in the car, working at the same time you were living in the car, to beating a 10-term congressmember, standing on the steps of the Capitol, where you are sleeping outside and working inside?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yeah, yeah. So, I was able to basically get off the streets because my family - my family and a family friend helped, because they also understood that I didn't have a place to put down on an application, a rental application, to say, you know, \"Call this landlord to see about my rental history,\" and so - which made it difficult to find a place, on top of the fact that I was very low-income, trying to raise two children. So, my family were helping me, but then also a family friend heard about it and just said, \"Hey, I have a rental property. You can come and stay here until you all get on your feet.\" And that is how we were able to finally come off the streets after living on the street and then living in one of those, you know, weekend - I mean, those extended-stay hotels.\n\nBut it was through that and a few other things, just seeing how people - it took somebody to notice what was going on, and it took someone to actually act. I think that is the other thing. It's one thing to know. It's one thing to say, \"Yeah, you know, this should happen, and this should happen, this should happen.\" But it's another thing for somebody to act and change your situation. So, I saw that, and I - thank you! I saw that, and I pushed that forward. And so, the more and more - and I wanted to extend that to other people, because it was extended to me, and it saved my life, and it saved the lives of my children.\n\nSo, when Michael Brown was murdered - before Michael Brown was murdered, I was on the streets working with the unhoused community then, working in helping to fight sex trafficking in my community. I started to do that work to give back, and then Michael Brown was murdered. And I took to the streets to lend my hand as a medic and as clergy, still trying to do the same work to help my community, and just did not like the response that was coming from those that were in power that should have been able to help us and fix - and help us to fix that situation. And the community asked me to show up and to run, so I did.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What would permanent housing justice look like? I mean, even with the housing eviction moratorium, which has now expired, people owe back rent. How can they possibly pay this in this time? And as you were speaking, we were also showing video of people holding up signs: \"You can't stay at home when you don't have a home.\" We're talking in the midst of a pandemic. If one person gets sick, we are all vulnerable.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yes, we are. We are. That's why, with our Unhoused Bill of Rights, one thing that is built in is $140 billion. It's a $200 billion bill, but it's $140 billion that goes towards building of homes, so building of homes that are affordable for people. The homes that will be where someone who is - who has experienced homelessness for a very long time, this is a home that they would be able to acquire.\n\nNot only that, if we are able to fix - because this bill talks about ending homelessness by 2025, completely eradicating homelessness. So, if we are able to eradicate homelessness with the Unhoused Bill of Rights, what we have right now, this crisis that should not be a crisis, when we have over $40 billion sitting right now that states and counties, other localities can use to help to make sure that some of this back rent is paid - if we need to go back and try to work on getting more funding, then we can do that. But right now what we have on the table, already out there, ready to go, that $40 billion, we have to move it. We have to move it, and we have to move it now, because we need - in order for people to stay in those homes, yes, we understand that landlords need to pay a mortgage company. So, that is why we're also stressing to the states and to those localities to get that money moving and get it into the hands of the people who are supposed to have it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Bush, how long do you plan to sleep out on the Capitol steps? And how many people are you sleeping out there with?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : I'm out here until change happens. You know, I have never set a date. Let me tell you, one hour before we came out here, I didn't know I would be out here, and didn't know - each day, I didn't know if there would be another day. And so, we're going moment by moment. And when change happens, we can go home. One thing that we cannot do is we cannot say, \"Well, we did all that we could do,\" and not apply the pressure needed to make sure that people aren't forced out of their homes. And I think that that's just our work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh warning last month, when the Supreme Court allowed a one-month extension of the eviction moratorium to stand, that any further extensions would have to go through Congress. So, what has the leadership said to you since they went home?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : So, what we are hearing is that, yes, that that is what - we're hearing that that is what the CDC and that is what the administration is - what they're looking at, to say, \"OK, we cannot - we can't do this. Congress has to act.\" But what we're saying is \"Let's do both. Let Congress act, and you do something that can happen immediately.\" It could have happened, you know, on Friday. It could have happened before Friday. It could have happened on Saturday. We're asking them to go ahead and do that, to at least buy us some time.\n\nAnd, you know, we know what Brett Kavanaugh said. And as far as we're concerned, his statement was not a Supreme Court ruling. His statement, out of his mouth, that was not a Supreme Court ruling. So, let the courts - if that's what needs to happen, that's not for us to worry about. The House, our job is to make sure that we're legislating. And right now there is power in the pen of the president of the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I thank you so much for joining us, outside of the Capitol, outside the House, as you have been unhoused yourself and now a House member. Congressmember Cori Bush represents Missouri's 1st Congressional District. Since Friday, she's been sleeping on the steps of the Capitol to protest her House colleagues adjourning for August recess without passing an extension on the eviction moratorium for renters. Stay safe, Congressmember Bush.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : When we come back, we continue our conversation with the authors of Inflamed: Deep Medicine and the Anatomy of Injustice . And we'll look at the connections between the pandemic and the climate crisis. We'll look at a new film, The Ants and the Grasshopper . Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWe speak with Missouri Congressmember Cori Bush, who is formerly unhoused, about why she has been sleeping on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with others since Friday night to protest her colleagues' decision to adjourn for August recess without passing an extension to the federal eviction moratorium, which expired July 31, as millions are behind on rent. Bush tells Democracy Now! she could not \"walk away from this situation and go on vacation\" knowing that millions of people could end up on the streets. \"This isn't easy. This is not performative in any way. I would rather be at home, but I understand the urgency and the need of this crisis right now,\" Bush says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn now to Congressmember Cori Bush, who represents Missouri's 1st Congressional District and has been sleeping on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with others since Friday night to protest her House colleagues adjourning for August recess without passing an extension on the eviction moratorium for renters, as nearly 12 million people are behind on rent. Congressmember Bush was formerly unhoused with her children. Her recent piece in Time magazine is headlined \"I Lived in My Car and Now I'm in Congress. We Need to Solve America's Housing Crisis.\"\n\nLast week, Congressmember Bush introduced the Unhoused Bill of Rights, which she describes as \"the first-ever federal legislation to declare the civil and human rights of unhoused individuals, particularly the right to sit, stand, sleep, or eat in public without fear of harassment or criminalization.\"\n\nEarlier today, Congressmember Bush tweeted, \"5 AM. This morning felt cold, like the wind was blowing straight through my sleeping bag. Since Friday-when some colleagues chose early vacation over voting to prevent evictions-we've been at the Capitol. It's an eviction emergency. Our people need an eviction moratorium. Now.\"\n\nShe joins us from those same Capitol steps. Congressmember Bush, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about why you've been sleeping on the steps for days now.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : You know, the idea that lawmakers, the only ones - lawmakers, our government, the levels of government that have some type of jurisdiction with this type of a situation, with this crisis, chose not to do anything to stop this from becoming a crisis, on top of all of the crises we have going on in the country right now. I'm out here because there is no organization that can make this decision to have this moratorium in place. There is no - there's no corporation. You know, there's no, like, big-named family. There's no wealthy person. There's none of that, that can make the decision to make sure that between 7 and 11 million people don't end up forced out of their homes. That is solely on the people in Congress, or, what we've been messaging, the White House and CDC working together in collaboration to get this done. And because that didn't happen on last Friday, the House did not get that done, I could not at all walk away from this situation and go on vacation, recess, knowing that millions of people could start to end up on the streets. So, we just - I did what I know to do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about what it is you know to do.\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : You know, I am an activist. I'm an organizer. I got my start, my official start, I guess I'd say, in activism after Michael Brown's murder in Ferguson in 2014. And we protested more than 400 days. And even after that, we protested - we've protested for years against injustices related to police brutality and more, and even the housing crisis. There was no way that I can do that work at home in St. Louis and then come here and see an atrocity taking place, that I have a hand in, and just sit by and let it go.\n\nSo, this is what I asked for. I asked for the people of St. Louis to send me here to be able to represent them, every single one of them. And I asked them to send me here to bring the same energy that I had on the streets of Ferguson all of those nights, bring that here in Congress.\n\nAnd so that's what I did. I know how to go ahead and say, \"Look, I'm going to protest this decision. I'm going to protest something that I know if we don't do anything, people will be hurt.\" And so that's what we did. And we brought two chairs and set them on the steps and took a picture and posted it out and said, \"Hey, we're here. You know, come and join us.\" And people did. And we've been here since Friday night.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were joined by several congressmembers, is that right, Friday night? Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, all slept out on the steps?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Yes, yes, slept on the steps. And let me just say that it's not comfortable. We cannot lay. There is a law here that you cannot lay down on the Capitol steps. So we have to sit up in a chair or sit up on the steps. So that's how we slept, sitting up. And we've done that every night since.\n\nAnd it gets cold at night. It was really cold last night. Last night, I feel, was the coldest night since we've been out here. It was raining back and forth. And so, to have other members out here at night - Representative Mondaire Jones came out here last night. We have to have more bodies, more congressmembers to show up.\n\nThis is the thing: We can't take the glory if we're not willing to go through the grind. There is grind happening right now. So go through the grind. Don't just start snatching glory.\n\nBecause let me tell you this: this is not - this isn't easy. This is not performative in any way. I would rather be at home, but I understand the urgency and the need of this crisis right now. And so, my body, it hurts physically. I am walking slow, and I lost my voice. It's just starting to come back. I've got a lot of honey on board right now and a lot of tea. I'm dizzy, I'm lightheaded. You know, I am so - I'm exhausted, emotionally and mentally. But it is nothing in comparison to what our unhoused community members face every single day, and what would happen if we send 7 to 11 million people out on the street.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how did this happen, Congressmember Bush? I mean, we're not talking about a Republican-led House; we're talking about a Democratic-led House. Nancy Pelosi went home to her house. How did - she's the House speaker. How did this happen? This eviction moratorium was extended several times before, but now Congress just went out on recess? And what are you saying Pelosi should be able to do right now? What do you demand of President Biden?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Our message has been clear for the last four days now, that we're not just talking to one particular group or one particular person, saying, \"Hey, you need to act,\" because it's such an urgent situation. So we're saying everybody that has - everybody. We need to use all the tools in our toolbox right now. So we've been saying to House leadership, \"Reconvene the House. Reconvene us.\" Chairman Jim McGovern of the House Rules Committee came here to the steps, addressed the crowd, and he said that the Rules Committee is waiting. They are ready to come back and do the work. He said we will be back in a nanosecond if we hear that we have 218 votes. So they're ready.\n\nAnd so, we are saying, \"Reconvene us. Let's do the work to make sure that we get the whip count right, and then come back and let us get this vote.\" Also, we're still saying to the White House and to the CDC , you know, \"Give us the moratorium. Give us the eviction moratorium.\" We're asking the president to pen the executive order. We need that done. And if there is a court challenge after that, we can deal with the court. That court challenge can be dealt with. In the meantime, though, while that is happening, if it happens, we will be able to, in the House, work on getting the bill that Chairwoman Maxine Waters has introduced, which extends - which has a moratorium until December the 31st. It's just a must.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what about Pelosi calling on the CDC to extend the moratorium?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Again, we have to use everything that we can. That was the route that she chose, was to say the CDC . We're saying CDC , White House, House leadership. We're even talking about the Senate. Come on. Like, we were all elected to serve the people. We didn't sign up to say, \"Oh, not people of low income. No, no, no, no. We're not talking about you.\" We didn't - there was no document that I saw. And when I raised my hand, that was not a part of what I swore. So, my job is to make sure that I'm speaking up for the over 740,000 people in my district, to make sure that their basic needs are met, plus anything else that's coming up that is within my wheelhouse to take care of. And the same thing for each and every one of the people that you just named, they have to do their work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Bush, can you talk about the Unhoused Bill of Rights, this unprecedented bill that you've just introduced?\n\nREP . CORI BUSH : Sure. The Unhoused Bill of Rights is a resolution that - it lays out what those civil rights protections, what dignity looks like for our unhoused neighbors. We need to make sure that - because what we've seen is that the protections for our community members who are experiencing homelessness is - it just doesn't seem like it's respected at all.

And so, we decided to build a framework so that we can build legislation from this.\n\nWe want to make sure that we're talking about every single thing that affects someone who is living unhoused, from hostile architecture, which I think is absolutely - I just can't believe who comes up with these things, to want to take the bus stop bench and make it to where you can't lay down on it. You know, those type of things. It's unbelievable. And I think about when I was unhoused, when I was sleeping in a car, the one thing that I did have was the car.\n\nAnd I never went into a shelter.

So, I saw that, and I - thank you! I saw that, and I pushed that forward. And so, the more and more - and I wanted to extend that to other people, because it was extended to me, and it saved my life, and it saved the lives of my children.\n\nSo, when Michael Brown was murdered - before Michael Brown was murdered, I was on the streets working with the unhoused community then, working in helping to fight sex trafficking in my community.

And the community asked me to show up and to run, so I did.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What would permanent housing justice look like? I mean, even with the housing eviction moratorium, which has now expired, people owe back rent. How can they possibly pay this in this time? And as you were speaking, we were also showing video of people holding up signs: \"You can't stay at home when you don't have a home.\" We're talking in the midst of a pandemic.

      "text": "Cori Bush on losing her US House seat: 'I'm just getting started'\n\nThe progressive Missouri representative says she won't stop fighting for wages, housing justice and police accountability\n\nCori Bush may be leaving Congress this month, but she is determined to stay in the fight for the future of the Democratic party and the direction of the country.\n\nBush, a two-term progressive representative from Missouri who lost her primary race in August amid an onslaught of spending by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), looks back on her four years in the House with pride as she prepares to start a new chapter of her political career.\n\n\"I'm happy about the work that we've done, but also I just feel like there's just so much more to do, and I just want St Louis to have the best outcome,\" Bush said. \"I'm keeping the door open to many possibilities, but right now, all I can say is this: I'm not going anywhere. I'm just getting started.\"\n\nBush, a member of the progressive \"Squad\" in the House, made a splash on Capitol Hill from her very first days there. After first gaining attention as an activist and community leader in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014, Bush won a House race on her second attempt in 2020 and was sworn in just days before the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Less than a week after the attack, Bush introduced a resolution to expel Republican members who had supported efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, accusing them of sedition.\n\nSeven months later, Bush made headlines again by staging a four-day protest on the Capitol steps to extend a pandemic-related moratorium on evictions. One month after that, she testified before the House oversight committee about her decision to have an abortion after she was raped at the age of 17.\n\n\"We worked really, really hard,\" Bush said. \"We've done some great things, and historic things, in our office in just a very short time, in four years, and I decided to be who I said I would be on the campaign trail, to be that person in Congress.\"\n\nBush's outspoken politics ultimately cost her a seat in the House. In the days after the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, Bush introduced the Ceasefire Now resolution calling for an end to the war in Gaza. After its introduction, Bush became the target of attack ads from Aipac's Super Pac, the United Democracy Project (UDP).\n\nThe Super Pac ran ads criticizing Bush for voting against Biden's infrastructure bill and accusing her of failing to deliver for her district. The ads further imperiled Bush, who was already viewed as vulnerable after the justice department launched an investigation into her potential misuse of campaign funds for security services.\n\nIn total, UDP spent roughly $8.5m boosting Bush's primary opponent, the St Louis county prosecutor Wesley Bell, who won the race by 5.5 points in August.\n\nWith her defeat, Bush became the second Squad member to lose a primary to an Aipac-backed challenger, after Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his race to fellow Democrat George Latimer in June. Bush pointed to the two losses as evidence of the need to get dark money out of US elections, and she specifically excoriated Aipac for unseating Black lawmakers. During Bush's primary, UDP was accused of distributing campaign mailers that distorted her features to lean into racist tropes about Black people.\n\n\"They made sure that they targeted Black legislators. Let's just be clear: they targeted with the most money Black legislators, and I think that that was on purpose,\" Bush said. \"I will say to the Democratic party: we have to do a better job.\"\n\nUDP did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment. Bush framed Aipac's involvement in Democratic primaries as a deliberate attempt to shift the party's politics rightward. According to a Politico analysis , Aipac served as the largest source of Republican money into competitive Democratic primaries this year.\n\n\"I need Democrats to pay attention to the fact that what they're really doing is they're trying to move Democrats to the right,\" Bush said. \"And so they're not going to stop with us.\"\n\nAipac's ability to pour millions of dollars into Democratic primaries underscores the threat of dark-money groups, Bush argued. She implored Democrats, specifically progressive lawmakers, to reject donations from corporate special interest groups.\n\n\"I don't take corporate Pac money. We are 100% grassroots funded. So I can't be bought by anyone,\" Bush said. \"In this democracy, we should not be able to buy elections. ... We do need to get the corporate money completely out of our elections. And it has to start with our leadership.\"\n\nThe push to get corporate money out of politics could play a role in Bush's next career move after Congress, but for now, she is making the most of her final days as a House member. She has joined forces with Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a fellow Squad member, to urge Joe Biden to direct the US archivist to certify and publish the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th amendment to the constitution.\n\n\"So much is housed under the Equal Rights Amendment. So we're talking about closing the gender wage gap, actual protections as it relates to violence against women, sexual discrimination and harassment in the workplace,\" Bush said. \"This is the time.\"\n\nThe campaign to certify the ERA faces significant legal hurdles. Earlier this month, the US archivist released a statement reiterating that courts had determined the ratification deadline had passed for the ERA, so the office could not legally publish it.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Bush sounded energized as she prepared to fight for progressive policies beyond Congress.\n\n\"I'll continue to work to increase the minimum wage, housing justice, economic justice, police accountability, all of the things,\" Bush said. \"I was on the outside, then went inside, and now I will be going back outside, so I will be able to take that knowledge with me, and those connections.\"\n\nShe hopes her ongoing efforts may serve as an inspiration for young progressives, many of whom feel dismayed and disillusioned over Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House.\n\n\"Let's turn that pain into purpose. Let's turn that discouragement into greater work. Because what we cannot do is shrink,\" Bush said. \"The fight for the next four years started already. We should already have our eyes on who's going to be president in four years. And so those talking points, that messaging, that change needs to happen right now.\""

      "text": "Cori Bush warns pro-Israel lobby 'to be afraid' after primary loss\n\nMember of progressive 'Squad' says her loss has freed her to openly challenge Aipac\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush has warned the pro-Israel lobby \"to be afraid\" after it poured millions of dollars into defeating the prominent member of the \"Squad\" of progressive Democrats in Tuesday's primary election in St Louis.\n\nBush said her loss to St Louis county prosecutor Wesley Bell after the hardline American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) targeted her for opposition to Israel's attack on Gaza had freed her to openly challenge the powerful pressure group, which has vowed to spend $100m to influence US elections this year in favour of Israel.\n\n\"They're about to see this other Cori, this other side,\" she told supporters . \"Aipac, I'm coming to tear your kingdom down.\"\n\nBush, who will continue to serve in Congress until January, added: \"All they did was radicalise me, so now they need to be afraid.\"\n\nBush did not say how she now intends to take on Aipac but critics of the lobby group, which has previously boasted of its ability to round up congressional support, have said that it should be obliged to register as an agent of a foreign government because it pushes Israel's interests over those of the US.\n\nAipac spent $8.5m to defeat Bush, mostly on negative advertising through its campaign financing arm, the United Democracy Project (UDP), in the second most expensive primary race in the US this year.\n\nAipac celebrated Bell's win, a second major victory after the UDP played a leading role in unseating New York representative Jamaal Bowman, another member of the Squad critical of Israel, with a tweet proclaiming: \"Being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics.\"\n\nBut groups supporting Bush noted that, as in other congressional races targeted by pro-Israel groups, almost none of the campaign advertising by the UDP addressed the Gaza war or Bush's call for a ceasefire. Instead, the UDP went after her on unrelated issues, particularly her voting record in Congress.\n\nSimilarly, the UDP spent $15m to defeat Bowman in the most expensive primary in US history with a barrage of negative advertising that had little to do with his criticisms of Israel. Much of the UDP's money comes from billionaires who fund hardline pro-Israel causes and Republicans in other races, including some who have given to Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nJews for Cori, a coalition of progressive Jewish organisations, blamed Bush's loss on \"Aipac's interference\" on behalf of Israel and the Republicans.\n\n\"While Aipac targeted both Bowman and Bush because of their support for Palestinian human rights, the group did not highlight or even mention this issue in their smear campaigns. While Aipac will claim their positions are 'good policy and good politics' it is clear that they are well-aware that they are losing the battle for public opinion,\" it said.\n\nJustice Democrats, which spent $1.8m on advertising in support of Bush, called her opponent \"an empty suit for Aipac and its GOP mega-donors to advance their own interests\".\n\nThe group's director, Alexandra Rojas, argued that the huge spending by the pro-Israel lobby to defeat individual members of Congress is a sign of weakness.\n\n\"As Aipac's influence in Congress wanes and the rightwing network that props it up is exposed, Aipac has to spend historic amounts in Democratic elections to continue advancing their interests at the expense of the Democratic mainstream that overwhelmingly supports a ceasefire and an end to the genocide in Gaza,\" she said.\n\nStill, if Aipac's intent in targeting Bush and Bowman was to warn other members of Congress that there will be a price to pay for muscular criticism of Israeli government policies and adopting minority positions, such as opposition to the US's considerable military aid to Israel, then the strategy may have the desired effect of encouraging other politicians to keep their criticisms of Israel to themselves out of fear of a challenge from a well financed opponent.\n\nBut Aipac is known to intervene when their congressional foes are already vulnerable. A number of the group's former targets - other \"Squad\" members known for their criticisms of Israel - have been spared the onslaught, insulated by their popularity within their districts.\n\nThe UDP spent heavily to try and oust Pennsylvania congresswoman Summer Lee in the 2022 Democratic primaries. She won that race by less than 1% of the vote.\n\nThis year, the lobby largely steered clear of Lee's race despite the emergence of a pro-Israel challenger. Lee won the primary by a margin of more than 20 points.\n\nSimilarly, a challenger backed by substantial pro-Israel money came close to unseating Ilhan Omar , another Squad member who has been accused of antisemitism over criticisms of Israel, in the 2022 primaries. Omar is again facing a challenge from the same opponent, Don Samuels, in next week's Democratic primary, but Aipac and similar groups have not thrown as much money or effort into this year's race. Opinion polls give Omar a substantial lead.\n\nThe UDP focused its efforts this year on Bush and Bowman, who were vulnerable to attack on issues other than Israel and Gaza, which many voters agree with them on. Both members of Congress struggled to justify voting against Joe Biden's trillion-dollar infrastructure bill - a primary line of attack of negative advertising.\n\nThe redrawing of the boundaries of Bowman's district reshaped it as a more traditionally Democratic constituency with less voter support for the Squad and progressive policies. Bowman was also open to criticism over an incident when he pulled a fire alarm at the Capitol in Washington DC in order to delay a vote on a government shutdown called by Republicans. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour over the incident."

      "text": "'I'm changing Congress': how Cori Bush brought her lived experience to Capitol Hill\n\nMember of 'the Squad' on how her abortion experience, sexual assault and front-line fight in Ferguson, Missouri, affected her politics\n\nHer new memoir is bracingly, sometimes painfully honest, but there is one passage that Cori Bush seriously considered striking out before publication.\n\nShe had an abortion when she was 19. Walking into the white-walled room of a reproductive health clinic, Bush writes, she began to have reservations about the procedure. Twice she told a nurse, \"I don't want to do this,\" but twice the nurse ignored her objections and carried on.\n\nBush heard \"the awful sounds as the vacuum sucked the fetus out of my body ... I remember the intense pain and the feeling of helplessness in that moment. I was furious. That doctor ignored my pleas. I was just another person in his assembly line, just another little Black girl.\"\n\nAs the prologue observes, The Forerunner is not your typical political memoir. Bush, 46, is not your typical politician. She is a registered nurse, ordained pastor, community activist and organiser and single mother. A Democrat from St Louis, she is the first Black woman to represent Missouri in the US Congress. She is also a survivor and embodiment of resilience.\n\nShe realises that her frank recollection of abortion as a traumatic experience is politically loaded and could be seized upon by anti-abortion activists to further their cause. It comes just a month before midterm elections in which Democrats hope to tap into public anger over the supreme court's decision to torch the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\"I know that many supporters of reproductive rights will be outraged by my decision to share this story,\" the congresswoman writes.\n\nYet in a phone interview, she tells the Guardian she has no regrets about including it. \"It was a difficult position but this memoir is me telling my story,\" she says. \"To silence me, to tell me you shouldn't tell this story because someone else can use it and weaponise it, that's not an answer. We've got to fix the problem. The way to make sure that the problem is highlighted and awareness is placed on the issue is to talk about it.\"\n\nWhile the abortion debate is often oversimplified, Bush is offering a reminder of the messy, nuanced reality that she faced as a young Black woman restrained by white medical providers. She continues: \"Speaking about what happened wasn't to condemn abortion providers at all because I work closely with a bunch of providers and reproductive health clinics and I support them.\n\n\"It's something that should not have happened to me and it is our work to not only fix certain parts of the system of harm; it is to do the work to fix all of it. But as I also wrote in my book, I was still able to have the services that I needed and the decision was mine to make. In the end, I made the right decision for me.\"\n\nOn the day in June that the supreme court's rightwing majority overturned its 1973 Roe v Wade ruling, Bush happened to be back at the same clinic where she had undergone that difficult abortion (along with a previous abortion that resulted from a rape when she was 17). The congresswoman was meeting with providers, advocates and the health secretary, Xavier Becerra, when the news came through.\n\n\"My chief of staff walked up to me during the conversation and showed me his phone and I couldn't believe it at first. I kept blinking and looking at his phone. Even though we knew that it was most likely going to come any day, it was still hard to see and for that reality to set in.\n\n\"Someone said it out loud and stopped the conversation: 'The supreme court just overturned Roe.' We all embraced one another. I shed tears, I yelled, I hollered out because I was thinking about the millions of people across this country that will be affected by this.\"\n\nThe court's decision led to a surge of women registering to vote in some states. In Missouri's neighbour Kansas, people voted overwhelmingly to continue to protect abortion in the state constitution. But recent midterm opinion polls suggest that Democratic anger over Roe v Wade could be eclipsed by Republican concerns over inflation and crime.\n\nBush insists, however: \"It's a huge motivator because we have to remember that this is something that had been in place since 1973 - this was in place when I was born. There are a lot of us that only know a Roe v Wade society and there are people who may not agree with abortion but they also don't agree with their rights being stripped away. Those folks are saying that's going to make me show up to vote for the Democrat because I don't want my rights being taken away.\"\n\nBush brings lived experience to Capitol Hill in ways unthinkable for a career politician. Having been evicted from her home several times, forcing her to sleep in her car with her children, last year she slept on the steps of the US Capitol in protest after Congress failed to pass legislation to extend an eviction moratorium (the White House eventually issued a new eviction moratorium).\n\nIn 2014 she was on the frontlines of the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown . This made her a target for harassment. Her tyres were slashed while her car was parked in front of the complex where she lived. She came home and found her front door had been tampered with.\n\nBush needed to move home. In 2016, a few weeks after losing a Democratic primary election for the Senate, she saw a social media post by a local faith healer advertising a house to rent. When she got in touch and went to see it, the man raped her. She describes the assault in unflinching, unforgiving detail and writes: \"I whimpered through the pain. It seemed like forever. I felt like dying. I wanted to die.\"\n\nBush explains by phone why she choose to open her memoir with this candid account: \"That changed everything and I am still in therapy now. I'm still walking out that journey to healing. It affected my life the way that it did because, when I thought about the sexual assaults I had back when I was 18, early adult, I went for the next 20 years blaming myself, like it was because my shorts were really short or my shirt was low or where I was when I met the person. I carried that for all of those years.\n\n\"This time I had just completed my first run for office and lost; I was grieving that but I was a registered nurse now, I was taking care of two kids, I had just come from work, I was in my scrubs uniform, I was going to a place to see a home. That's what really rocked me. Before, I thought it was because of something I did; I didn't do any of those things this time; I wasn't drinking, any of it.\n\n\"So that's why the book had to start with that, because my life turned upside down but, as I'm working through it, I've been able to help so many others and so many others have also helped me to be able to move forward.\"\n\nAfter the rape, Bush was horrified by the lack of discretion she was afforded. She tells how \"a caravan\" of people followed her to hospital and she was subjected to the humiliation of a rape kit. A forensic exam found that the encounter could have been an assault or, as the rapist had claimed, consensual rough sex. Bush went to court four times to get a protection order against the faith healer but repeatedly lost.\n\nAs a Christian, has she been able to forgive the man who raped her? She pauses. \"Let me just say I have some forgiveness but is there a blanket all-is-forgiven? I'm still working through that. I've always believed that forgiveness is for you, not for the other person, and so usually I'm quick to forgive.\n\n\"But in this instance, because there was some trust there and he hurt me the way that he hurt me and then he lied as a man of God and preacher of the gospel, and he continues on in this lie and continues to evade the system, that has made it difficult for me to just be like, yes, I forgive him and I'm going on with my life.\"\n\nThe Forerunner also gives Bush's insider account of joining thousands of activists on the streets in response to the 2014 shooting of Brown in Ferguson. She recalls how the skin on her face and arms burned after police fired teargas. The uprising went on for more than 400 days and, Bush argues, became a pivot point in the centuries-long struggle for Black liberation.\n\nIt also foreshadowed the nationwide protests for racial justice that followed the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. But calls from Bush and others to \"defund the police\" met with a predictable backlash, even from Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders. Some fear that the momentum of Black Lives Matter is again being lost.\n\nBut Bush contends that the working and the organising goes on: \"Even if we're not on the streets every single day chanting and marching, are we organising folks to get them to the polls? Are we organising groups to be able to teach people what to do if you get pulled over by the police? Are we organising groups to teach white people how to talk about and understand racism? Are we mobilising people to support our immigrant community if they're under attack? Are we organising for repro rights?\"\n\nShe accuses Republicans of wilfully distorting the central idea of defund the police , which means reallocating funding away from police departments to mental health workers, social workers and other government agencies. \"They would rather scare their people instead of educating them.\"\n\nBush became a leader of the movement seeking police and criminal justice reform in Ferguson and across the St Louis area. She lost a Democratic primary race for a congressional seat in 2018 but, with the backing of progressive group Justice Democrats, prevailed in 2020 over a 20-year incumbent. She was instantly embraced as a member of \"the squad\" in the House of Representatives; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez describes her as a \"sister-in-service\".\n\nThere have been wins and losses under Biden, a longtime moderate. The president declared racial equity a central plank of his agenda, appointed a diverse cabinet and far outpaced his predecessors in nominating women and people of colour to the federal bench. But legislation on police reform and voting rights stalled in a Congress where Democrats command only narrow majorities. Bush regards the glass as half full.\n\n\"Joe Biden has absolutely surprised me,\" she says, citing his decisions to commute the sentences of 75 people serving time for nonviolent drug offences, cancel billions of dollars in student loan debt and lift a pandemic-related expulsion policy that effectively closed America's asylum system at its border with Mexico.\n\nMany idealists have arrived in Washington only to find their dreams crushed by compromise. Is Bush changing Congress or is Congress changing her? She laughs. \"Congress is changing me a little bit in the way of helping me to see how, by pushing, our government can work for the regular everyday person. Not understanding the inner workings of Congress before, I wasn't able to see it but I knew that I needed to go inside of it to push for the change I wanted to see.\n\n\"But mostly I'm changing Congress because I've been there less than two years and we have been able to bring about some change and, if nothing else, my colleagues know where I stand on issues. They don't have to wonder what's going to happen if a policing bill comes forward, if we talk about Israel-Palestine, if they relate to equity and inclusion, anything that has to do with incarceration rates. There is no question. People know that I stand on the side of equity and equality.\""

Bush took about 46%.\n\nBell's win marks a second major victory for the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) after it played a leading role in unseating New York congressman Jamaal Bowman, another progressive Democrat who criticised the scale of Palestinian civilians deaths in Gaza, in a June primary.\n\nAipac pumped $8.5m into the race in Missouri's first congressional district to support Bell through its campaign funding arm, the United Democracy Project (UDP), after Bush angered some pro-Israel groups as one of the first members of Congress to call for a ceasefire after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel .\n\nMuch of the UDP's money comes from billionaires who fund hardline pro-Israel causes and Republicans in other races, including some who have given to Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nBush condemned Hamas for the killing of 1,139 people, mostly Israelis, and for abducting hundreds of others in October. But she also infuriated some Jewish and pro-Israel groups by describing Israel's subsequent attack on Gaza and large scale killing of civilians as \"collective punishment against Palestinians\" and a war crime.\n\nDuring the campaign, the UDP flooded St Louis with advertising hostile to Bush - although, as in other congressional races targeted by pro-Israel groups, it rarely mentioned the war in Gaza that has claimed nearly 40,000 Palestinian lives , mostly civilians, or her call for a ceasefire.\n\nInstead, the campaign focused on Bush's voting record in Congress, particularly her failure to support Joe Biden 's trillion-dollar infrastructure bill in 2021 and her support for the \"defund the police\" campaign. Bush struggled to get her message across that the UDP is misrepresenting both situations.\n\nThe UDP accounted for more than half of all the money spent on the race outside the campaigns themselves.\n\nBell has denied being recruited by pro-Israel groups to run against Bush, but suspicion lingered after he abandoned a challenge for the US Senate and entered the congressional race not long after Jewish organisations in St Louis began to seek a candidate to take on Bush after accusing her of \"intentionally fuelling antisemitism\".\n\nBell is expected to win what is one of the safest Democratic congressional seats in November's general election."

      "text": "Pro-Israel groups have set sights on unseating this progressive lawmaker. Will they succeed?\n\nChallenger Wesley Bell switched party lines to vie for Cori Bush's Missouri seat and has reaped millions from normally Republican-supporting donors\n\nCori Bush was knocking on doors along Arsenal Street in southern St Louis where voters were not shy of asking hard questions of Missouri's first Black female member of Congress. But none of them raised the one issue that looms over her re-election race like a spectre.\n\nBush might have been expected to cruise to victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary for Missouri's first congressional district in St Louis as she did two years ago. But her path to re-election veered into rough territory after she characterised Israel's assault on Gaza, following the 7 October Hamas attack, as a \"collective punishment\" of Palestinians and called for a ceasefire.\n\n\"I strongly condemn Hamas & their appalling violations of human rights,\" she wrote , \"but violations of human rights don't justify more human rights violations in retaliation.\"\n\nSome Jewish and pro-Israel groups said Bush was denying Israel the right to defend itself and siding with terrorists. A coalition of St Louis Jewish organisations accused her of \"intentionally fuelling antisemitism\".\n\nBush introduced a resolution calling for a ceasefire on 16 October. Within days, the St Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell announced he was dropping out of a race against a Republican for one of Missouri's seats in the US Senate to challenge Bush for the Democratic nomination in the St Louis congressional district. It was swiftly apparent that Bell, who has firmly supported Israel's actions, had the support of the US's major pro-Israel groups which have now poured millions of dollars into trying to make him the Democratic candidate in one of the party's safest congressional seats.\n\nLeading the way is the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Its campaign funding arm, the United Democracy Project (UDP), has so far spent $8.5m to defeat Bush, accounting for more than 55% of all spending on the race outside of the campaigns themselves. Much of the UDP's money comes from billionaires who fund Republicans in other races, including some who have given to Donald Trump 's campaign.\n\nIn total, outside groups have spent more than $12m to support Bell as opposed to $3m for Bush.\n\nThe UDP has committed more money in only one other primary contest so far this year: to defeat the New York congressman Jamaal Bowman, another member of the Squad of leftwing Democrats and outspoken critic of Israel's bombardment of Gaza, which has claimed nearly 40,000 Palestinian lives , mostly civilians.\n\nUDP advertising has flooded St Louis airwaves and mailboxes but, as in other congressional races targeted by pro-Israel groups, almost none of it mentions the Gaza war or Bush's call for a ceasefire, which is supported by a majority of Americans. Instead, the ads go after her on unrelated issues. They may be working.\n\nWhen Peggy Hoelting answered her door on Arsenal street, she recognised Bush and greeted her warmly. But Hoelting swiftly said she had some questions, and began regurgitating criticisms of the congresswoman's voting record that have been the target of UDP ads that paint Bush as too leftwing, and claim she is voting against the interests of her constituents.\n\nHoelting asked about Bush's vote against Joe Biden 's trillion-dollar infrastructure bill in 2021, a focus of the UDP messaging blitz. Bush explained that it was a parliamentary manoeuvre to protect parallel legislation, the Build Back Better Act, that included help for families, expanded public healthcare and green energy jobs. She said she knew the infrastructure act was going to pass anyway but the vote has come back to haunt her.\n\nAfter Bush moved up the street, Hoelting told the Guardian her questions were prompted by UDP advertising landing at her door.\n\n\"We get probably five or six ads in the mail every day. I sit down and look at them all. A lot of them are talking about her voting against Biden's infrastructure bill. I don't understand that so I wanted to hear what she had to say,\" she said.\n\nHoelting said she wasn't wholly persuaded by Bush's explanation but was keeping an open mind. She was unaware of Bush's position on Gaza but, when it was explained to her, said that would be a reason to vote for her.\n\n\"Absolutely I want a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Hoelting.\n\nBush has also been the target of ads for supporting the \"defund the police\" campaign. The representative said she wants to see money now spent on militarised vehicles and equipment which belong in war zones instead used to fund social workers and other services that would assist the police in dealing with people with mental health and addiction issues.\n\nBush acknowledged that the UDP ads were having an impact.\n\n\"The one thing that people ask me questions about is the infrastructure vote. There's a lot of people who say, 'tell me about the infrastructure bill, I just want to understand what happened'. So then I explain why I voted the way I voted,\" she said.\n\nBush said that most voters accept her reasoning but it leaves some undecided. In contrast, she said her position on Gaza almost never gets brought up on the doorstep.\n\n\"The only time it has come up is when people have said to me, 'thank you',\" she said.\n\nThis leaves Bush all the more frustrated by the influence on the campaign of pro-Israel lobby money, much of which comes from billionaires who also donate to Republicans .\n\nThe UDP's single largest donor for the 2024 elections so far is Jan Koum, the billionaire founder of WhatsApp who has given $5m. Koum is also a major funder of a group that supports Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and rightwing Zionist organisations.\n\nOther major funding has come from a long list of Republican donors including the billionaire hedge fund founders Jonathon Jacobson, Paul Singer and Bernard Marcus, the founder of Home Depot, all of whom are outspoken supporters of Israel.\n\nBush accused the UDP of deceit because none of its advertising makes clear Aipac's involvement or reference to Israel. She said Wesley Bell, her challenger, was complicit because, although legally his campaign cannot coordinate with the UDP or other outside groups, he has adopted their messaging.\n\n\"It is confusing people. They're wondering why Wesley Bell is allowing himself to be bankrolled by Republicans? People are asking, 'is he a really Democrat?' Some feel betrayed because he is allowing for Republicans to decide who is going to be their next representative. That benefits Republicans and that is shameful,\" she said.\n\nBush has called Bell \"a faux-progressive, former Republican campaign operative\" because he managed the 2006 congressional campaign of Mark Byrne, a Republican running for the seat Bush now holds. Bell put Byrne's opposition to abortion to the fore of that ultimately unsuccessful campaign. Bell has played down the association by saying he was helping out a longtime friend.\n\nBell has also denied being a stalking horse for pro-Israel groups. He claimed to have abandoned the race to unseat Missouri's firebrand Republican Senator, Josh Hawley, because he kept hearing from Democrats that they were unhappy with Bush and wanted him in the US House of Representatives speaking for St Louis .\n\nStill, the timing of his switch has fuelled suspicions.\n\nEarlier this week, the St Louis television station KDSK revealed a recording of a phone conversation made a year ago between the now-rival candidates in which Bell assured Bush he would not challenge her.\n\n\"I'm telling you on my word, I am not running against you. That is not happening,\" he said.\n\nBut days after the Hamas attack on Israel, Bell dropped out of the race against Hawley and announced he would run against Bush instead.\n\nBell's campaign manager, Jordan Sanders, told KDSK that when he made the statement, \"Bell had no intentions to run against Cori Bush .\"\n\n\"He switched races and decided to run against her after being encouraged by stakeholders at the local, statewide and national level,\" he aid.\n\nIn downtown St Louis, Ernest Bradley, a former student development counsellor at a regional university, said he was not aware of Bush's position on Gaza or the involvement of hardline pro-Israel groups in the election. But he was unhappy to see one Black candidate challenge another.\n\n\" I respect Wesley but I think it's bullshit. I think some money came his way and said to go this other way. I truly do. So when I hear that he's getting money from the Republicans I wonder what's really going on,\" said Bradley.\n\n\"I'm going to vote for Bush because it's very fishy.\"\n\nWith Bush looking vulnerable, others have weighed in. The second largest spender in support of Bell after UDP is Fairshake, a group funded in good part by rightwing billionaires who also back Trump , such as Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and the Winklevoss twins. Fairshake has spent more than $1m to defeat Bush.\n\nBush has also come under scrutiny for employing her husband to do security work, which she has defended as legal and not funded by her congressional office. The justice department said it was looking into the issue but a congressional ethics investigation concluded that the payments were legitimate.\n\nBush's largest backer is Justice Democrats which has spent more than $1.8m in support of her campaign with messages telling voters that Bell is backed by Aipac and Republican money, and accusing him of misusing public funds.\n\nBush also has some important endorsements, including that of the father of Michael Brown , whose death at 18 at the hands of a Ferguson police officer 10 years ago fired up the Black Lives Matter movement .\n\nFerguson is part of the first congressional district, and Bush emerged as an organiser of social justice campaigns there after Brown's death. Bell was voted on to Ferguson city council on the back of the protests. Later he was elected county prosecutor on a pledge to put the white officer responsible for Brown's death on trial.\n\nBut that never happened. Now, Brown's father, Michael Sr, is appearing in a campaign ad for Bush claiming that Bell failed the family.\n\n\"I feel like he lied to us. He never brought charges against the killer. He never walked the streets of Ferguson with me. He failed to reform the office. He used my family for power and now, he's trying to sell out St Louis. He doesn't care about us,\" Brown said in the ad.\n\nWhat little opinion polling there is no clear sign of who will win, but Bush acknowledges she has a fight on her hands - one that is also dividing St Louis's Jewish population.\n\nIn early July, a group of St Louis rabbis and cantors wrote to a local newspaper , the STL Jewish Light, describing Bush as \"one of Israel's most unashamed enemies\". The letter called on Jewish voters to turn out in support of Bell and pointed to Bowman's defeat in New York as the \"tested roadmap to follow\". It said that the turnout of Jewish voters, who account for about 3% of the population in the district, but is probably a higher proportion of those who vote, could decide the race.\n\n\"The national pro-Israel community is engaged in this race, but they aren't casting ballots on August 6. Only our community can do that,\" the letter said.\n\nA new ostensibly non-partisan group, St Louis Votes , is working to get out the Jewish vote. Although its charitable status precludes it from backing a candidate, its organisers include people who worked to unseat Bowman. The group's website urges Jews to vote because \"antisemitism is on the ballot\".\n\nA group called Progressive Jews for St Louis has pushed back against the rabbis' letter by accusing them of misrepresenting Bush's record.\n\n\"What bothers these rabbis is that Cori Bush's concern extends to Palestinians also. She called for a ceasefire early because she wants to save lives,\" the group said in response.\n\nHannah Rosenthal, a member of Progressive Jews for St Louis, has been canvassing for Bush in Jewish neighbourhoods.\n\n\"The institutional Jewish community, mainstream institutions, are trying to create this message that Cori's antisemitic because of her calls for a ceasefire. But we're finding that when you have conversations with people about what Cori actually stands for, her principled moral leadership, then people are swaying more from their undecided positions,\" she said.\n\n\"More than half of American Jews support a ceasefire at this time and they understand that criticising the policies and practices of the [Israeli] state are not antisemitic.\"\n\nBush said she was perplexed by accusations of antisemitism, given that she has spent her political career speaking up about racism.\n\n\"I can't understand why I am wrong for wanting Palestinians to live and have their own self-determination. I want Israelis to live, to be safe, have their freedom. I want the exact same thing for Palestinians. What about that makes me antisemitic?\" she said.\n\n\"What that says to me, though, is there is hatred and it's not coming from me. There is hatred for people like me for loving Palestinians the same way that I love Israelis and Jewish people in this country. If that is a problem, then they need to check their own heart, they need to check their own issues not mine.\"\n\nNonetheless, speaking up on Gaza has exacted a political price. Is it one worth paying?\n\n\" It's been challenging and puts me in a place where I have to do a lot more to be able to win. But that does not take precedence. The price has been paid by the 40,000 [Palestinians] that lost their lives, the tens of thousands who are injured. So if I have to piss off some people politically to be able to help save lives, then that's how it is,\" she said."

      "text": "Cori Bush on losing her US House seat: 'I'm just getting started'\n\nThe progressive Missouri representative says she won't stop fighting for wages, housing justice and police accountability\n\nCori Bush may be leaving Congress this month, but she is determined to stay in the fight for the future of the Democratic party and the direction of the country.\n\nBush, a two-term progressive representative from Missouri who lost her primary race in August amid an onslaught of spending by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), looks back on her four years in the House with pride as she prepares to start a new chapter of her political career.\n\n\"I'm happy about the work that we've done, but also I just feel like there's just so much more to do, and I just want St Louis to have the best outcome,\" Bush said. \"I'm keeping the door open to many possibilities, but right now, all I can say is this: I'm not going anywhere. I'm just getting started.\"\n\nBush, a member of the progressive \"Squad\" in the House, made a splash on Capitol Hill from her very first days there. After first gaining attention as an activist and community leader in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014, Bush won a House race on her second attempt in 2020 and was sworn in just days before the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Less than a week after the attack, Bush introduced a resolution to expel Republican members who had supported efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, accusing them of sedition.\n\nSeven months later, Bush made headlines again by staging a four-day protest on the Capitol steps to extend a pandemic-related moratorium on evictions. One month after that, she testified before the House oversight committee about her decision to have an abortion after she was raped at the age of 17.\n\n\"We worked really, really hard,\" Bush said. \"We've done some great things, and historic things, in our office in just a very short time, in four years, and I decided to be who I said I would be on the campaign trail, to be that person in Congress.\"\n\nBush's outspoken politics ultimately cost her a seat in the House. In the days after the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, Bush introduced the Ceasefire Now resolution calling for an end to the war in Gaza. After its introduction, Bush became the target of attack ads from Aipac's Super Pac, the United Democracy Project (UDP).\n\nThe Super Pac ran ads criticizing Bush for voting against Biden's infrastructure bill and accusing her of failing to deliver for her district. The ads further imperiled Bush, who was already viewed as vulnerable after the justice department launched an investigation into her potential misuse of campaign funds for security services.\n\nIn total, UDP spent roughly $8.5m boosting Bush's primary opponent, the St Louis county prosecutor Wesley Bell, who won the race by 5.5 points in August.\n\nWith her defeat, Bush became the second Squad member to lose a primary to an Aipac-backed challenger, after Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his race to fellow Democrat George Latimer in June. Bush pointed to the two losses as evidence of the need to get dark money out of US elections, and she specifically excoriated Aipac for unseating Black lawmakers. During Bush's primary, UDP was accused of distributing campaign mailers that distorted her features to lean into racist tropes about Black people.\n\n\"They made sure that they targeted Black legislators. Let's just be clear: they targeted with the most money Black legislators, and I think that that was on purpose,\" Bush said. \"I will say to the Democratic party: we have to do a better job.\"\n\nUDP did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment. Bush framed Aipac's involvement in Democratic primaries as a deliberate attempt to shift the party's politics rightward. According to a Politico analysis , Aipac served as the largest source of Republican money into competitive Democratic primaries this year.\n\n\"I need Democrats to pay attention to the fact that what they're really doing is they're trying to move Democrats to the right,\" Bush said. \"And so they're not going to stop with us.\"\n\nAipac's ability to pour millions of dollars into Democratic primaries underscores the threat of dark-money groups, Bush argued. She implored Democrats, specifically progressive lawmakers, to reject donations from corporate special interest groups.\n\n\"I don't take corporate Pac money. We are 100% grassroots funded. So I can't be bought by anyone,\" Bush said. \"In this democracy, we should not be able to buy elections. ... We do need to get the corporate money completely out of our elections. And it has to start with our leadership.\"\n\nThe push to get corporate money out of politics could play a role in Bush's next career move after Congress, but for now, she is making the most of her final days as a House member. She has joined forces with Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a fellow Squad member, to urge Joe Biden to direct the US archivist to certify and publish the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th amendment to the constitution.\n\n\"So much is housed under the Equal Rights Amendment. So we're talking about closing the gender wage gap, actual protections as it relates to violence against women, sexual discrimination and harassment in the workplace,\" Bush said. \"This is the time.\"\n\nThe campaign to certify the ERA faces significant legal hurdles. Earlier this month, the US archivist released a statement reiterating that courts had determined the ratification deadline had passed for the ERA, so the office could not legally publish it.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Bush sounded energized as she prepared to fight for progressive policies beyond Congress.\n\n\"I'll continue to work to increase the minimum wage, housing justice, economic justice, police accountability, all of the things,\" Bush said. \"I was on the outside, then went inside, and now I will be going back outside, so I will be able to take that knowledge with me, and those connections.\"\n\nShe hopes her ongoing efforts may serve as an inspiration for young progressives, many of whom feel dismayed and disillusioned over Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House.\n\n\"Let's turn that pain into purpose. Let's turn that discouragement into greater work. Because what we cannot do is shrink,\" Bush said. \"The fight for the next four years started already. We should already have our eyes on who's going to be president in four years. And so those talking points, that messaging, that change needs to happen right now.\""

      "text": "'I'm changing Congress': how Cori Bush brought her lived experience to Capitol Hill\n\nMember of 'the Squad' on how her abortion experience, sexual assault and front-line fight in Ferguson, Missouri, affected her politics\n\nHer new memoir is bracingly, sometimes painfully honest, but there is one passage that Cori Bush seriously considered striking out before publication.\n\nShe had an abortion when she was 19. Walking into the white-walled room of a reproductive health clinic, Bush writes, she began to have reservations about the procedure. Twice she told a nurse, \"I don't want to do this,\" but twice the nurse ignored her objections and carried on.\n\nBush heard \"the awful sounds as the vacuum sucked the fetus out of my body ... I remember the intense pain and the feeling of helplessness in that moment. I was furious. That doctor ignored my pleas. I was just another person in his assembly line, just another little Black girl.\"\n\nAs the prologue observes, The Forerunner is not your typical political memoir. Bush, 46, is not your typical politician. She is a registered nurse, ordained pastor, community activist and organiser and single mother. A Democrat from St Louis, she is the first Black woman to represent Missouri in the US Congress. She is also a survivor and embodiment of resilience.\n\nShe realises that her frank recollection of abortion as a traumatic experience is politically loaded and could be seized upon by anti-abortion activists to further their cause. It comes just a month before midterm elections in which Democrats hope to tap into public anger over the supreme court's decision to torch the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\"I know that many supporters of reproductive rights will be outraged by my decision to share this story,\" the congresswoman writes.\n\nYet in a phone interview, she tells the Guardian she has no regrets about including it. \"It was a difficult position but this memoir is me telling my story,\" she says. \"To silence me, to tell me you shouldn't tell this story because someone else can use it and weaponise it, that's not an answer. We've got to fix the problem. The way to make sure that the problem is highlighted and awareness is placed on the issue is to talk about it.\"\n\nWhile the abortion debate is often oversimplified, Bush is offering a reminder of the messy, nuanced reality that she faced as a young Black woman restrained by white medical providers. She continues: \"Speaking about what happened wasn't to condemn abortion providers at all because I work closely with a bunch of providers and reproductive health clinics and I support them.\n\n\"It's something that should not have happened to me and it is our work to not only fix certain parts of the system of harm; it is to do the work to fix all of it. But as I also wrote in my book, I was still able to have the services that I needed and the decision was mine to make. In the end, I made the right decision for me.\"\n\nOn the day in June that the supreme court's rightwing majority overturned its 1973 Roe v Wade ruling, Bush happened to be back at the same clinic where she had undergone that difficult abortion (along with a previous abortion that resulted from a rape when she was 17). The congresswoman was meeting with providers, advocates and the health secretary, Xavier Becerra, when the news came through.\n\n\"My chief of staff walked up to me during the conversation and showed me his phone and I couldn't believe it at first. I kept blinking and looking at his phone. Even though we knew that it was most likely going to come any day, it was still hard to see and for that reality to set in.\n\n\"Someone said it out loud and stopped the conversation: 'The supreme court just overturned Roe.' We all embraced one another. I shed tears, I yelled, I hollered out because I was thinking about the millions of people across this country that will be affected by this.\"\n\nThe court's decision led to a surge of women registering to vote in some states. In Missouri's neighbour Kansas, people voted overwhelmingly to continue to protect abortion in the state constitution. But recent midterm opinion polls suggest that Democratic anger over Roe v Wade could be eclipsed by Republican concerns over inflation and crime.\n\nBush insists, however: \"It's a huge motivator because we have to remember that this is something that had been in place since 1973 - this was in place when I was born. There are a lot of us that only know a Roe v Wade society and there are people who may not agree with abortion but they also don't agree with their rights being stripped away. Those folks are saying that's going to make me show up to vote for the Democrat because I don't want my rights being taken away.\"\n\nBush brings lived experience to Capitol Hill in ways unthinkable for a career politician. Having been evicted from her home several times, forcing her to sleep in her car with her children, last year she slept on the steps of the US Capitol in protest after Congress failed to pass legislation to extend an eviction moratorium (the White House eventually issued a new eviction moratorium).\n\nIn 2014 she was on the frontlines of the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown . This made her a target for harassment. Her tyres were slashed while her car was parked in front of the complex where she lived. She came home and found her front door had been tampered with.\n\nBush needed to move home. In 2016, a few weeks after losing a Democratic primary election for the Senate, she saw a social media post by a local faith healer advertising a house to rent. When she got in touch and went to see it, the man raped her. She describes the assault in unflinching, unforgiving detail and writes: \"I whimpered through the pain. It seemed like forever. I felt like dying. I wanted to die.\"\n\nBush explains by phone why she choose to open her memoir with this candid account: \"That changed everything and I am still in therapy now. I'm still walking out that journey to healing. It affected my life the way that it did because, when I thought about the sexual assaults I had back when I was 18, early adult, I went for the next 20 years blaming myself, like it was because my shorts were really short or my shirt was low or where I was when I met the person. I carried that for all of those years.\n\n\"This time I had just completed my first run for office and lost; I was grieving that but I was a registered nurse now, I was taking care of two kids, I had just come from work, I was in my scrubs uniform, I was going to a place to see a home. That's what really rocked me. Before, I thought it was because of something I did; I didn't do any of those things this time; I wasn't drinking, any of it.\n\n\"So that's why the book had to start with that, because my life turned upside down but, as I'm working through it, I've been able to help so many others and so many others have also helped me to be able to move forward.\"\n\nAfter the rape, Bush was horrified by the lack of discretion she was afforded. She tells how \"a caravan\" of people followed her to hospital and she was subjected to the humiliation of a rape kit. A forensic exam found that the encounter could have been an assault or, as the rapist had claimed, consensual rough sex. Bush went to court four times to get a protection order against the faith healer but repeatedly lost.\n\nAs a Christian, has she been able to forgive the man who raped her? She pauses. \"Let me just say I have some forgiveness but is there a blanket all-is-forgiven? I'm still working through that. I've always believed that forgiveness is for you, not for the other person, and so usually I'm quick to forgive.\n\n\"But in this instance, because there was some trust there and he hurt me the way that he hurt me and then he lied as a man of God and preacher of the gospel, and he continues on in this lie and continues to evade the system, that has made it difficult for me to just be like, yes, I forgive him and I'm going on with my life.\"\n\nThe Forerunner also gives Bush's insider account of joining thousands of activists on the streets in response to the 2014 shooting of Brown in Ferguson. She recalls how the skin on her face and arms burned after police fired teargas. The uprising went on for more than 400 days and, Bush argues, became a pivot point in the centuries-long struggle for Black liberation.\n\nIt also foreshadowed the nationwide protests for racial justice that followed the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. But calls from Bush and others to \"defund the police\" met with a predictable backlash, even from Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders. Some fear that the momentum of Black Lives Matter is again being lost.\n\nBut Bush contends that the working and the organising goes on: \"Even if we're not on the streets every single day chanting and marching, are we organising folks to get them to the polls? Are we organising groups to be able to teach people what to do if you get pulled over by the police? Are we organising groups to teach white people how to talk about and understand racism? Are we mobilising people to support our immigrant community if they're under attack? Are we organising for repro rights?\"\n\nShe accuses Republicans of wilfully distorting the central idea of defund the police , which means reallocating funding away from police departments to mental health workers, social workers and other government agencies. \"They would rather scare their people instead of educating them.\"\n\nBush became a leader of the movement seeking police and criminal justice reform in Ferguson and across the St Louis area. She lost a Democratic primary race for a congressional seat in 2018 but, with the backing of progressive group Justice Democrats, prevailed in 2020 over a 20-year incumbent. She was instantly embraced as a member of \"the squad\" in the House of Representatives; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez describes her as a \"sister-in-service\".\n\nThere have been wins and losses under Biden, a longtime moderate. The president declared racial equity a central plank of his agenda, appointed a diverse cabinet and far outpaced his predecessors in nominating women and people of colour to the federal bench. But legislation on police reform and voting rights stalled in a Congress where Democrats command only narrow majorities. Bush regards the glass as half full.\n\n\"Joe Biden has absolutely surprised me,\" she says, citing his decisions to commute the sentences of 75 people serving time for nonviolent drug offences, cancel billions of dollars in student loan debt and lift a pandemic-related expulsion policy that effectively closed America's asylum system at its border with Mexico.\n\nMany idealists have arrived in Washington only to find their dreams crushed by compromise. Is Bush changing Congress or is Congress changing her? She laughs. \"Congress is changing me a little bit in the way of helping me to see how, by pushing, our government can work for the regular everyday person. Not understanding the inner workings of Congress before, I wasn't able to see it but I knew that I needed to go inside of it to push for the change I wanted to see.\n\n\"But mostly I'm changing Congress because I've been there less than two years and we have been able to bring about some change and, if nothing else, my colleagues know where I stand on issues. They don't have to wonder what's going to happen if a policing bill comes forward, if we talk about Israel-Palestine, if they relate to equity and inclusion, anything that has to do with incarceration rates. There is no question. People know that I stand on the side of equity and equality.\""

I also believe in transparency, which is why I can confirm that the Department of Justice is reviewing my campaign's spending on security services,\" said Bush, part of a progressive group of Democratic women known as \"the Squad\".\n\nShe added that the allegations were rooted in \"baseless complaints\" raised by rightwing organizations who have long made her a target.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Bush, a nurse and Black Lives Matter activist turned lawmaker who represents the St Louis area, said she has endured threats to her \"physical safety and life\" since before she took office in 2021.\n\nBush said that as a rank-and-file member of Congress she is not entitled to receive security protection by the House and has instead used campaign funds to pay for security services.\n\n\"I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services,\" she said. \"Any reporting that I have used federal funds for personal security is simply false.\"\n\nAt issue, the congresswoman continued, was her decision to hire her husband, Cortney Merritts, to provide her with security services. She paid a total of $62,359 to Merritts for security services in 2022 before the pair were married, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch .\n\n\"In particular, the nature of these allegations have been around my husband's role on the campaign,\" she said.\n\n\"In accordance with all applicable rules, I retained my husband as part of my security team to provide security services because he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate.\"\n\nShe said that the Office of Congressional Ethics had investigated the matter last year and voted to dismiss the allegations.\n\n\"In September of last year, after conducting a months-long investigation, the Office of Congressional Ethics found no wrongdoing and voted unanimously to dismiss the case,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I look forward to this same outcome from all pending investigations.\"\n\nThe department has subpoenaed the House sergeant at arms, the chamber's top law enforcement official, for records relating to the alleged misspending, according to six sources with knowledge about the investigation, Punchbowl reported .\n\nBush became the first Black woman to represent Missouri in Congress, after her 2020 victory against the 10-term representative Lacy Clay. She held an event on Saturday to kick off her latest re-election campaign.\n\nBush said: \"I am under no illusion that these rightwing organizations will stop politicizing and pursuing efforts to attack me and the work that the people of St Louis sent me to Congress to do: to lead boldly, to legislate change my constituents can feel, and to save lives.\""

And now she's the first Black woman from Missouri to be elected to Congress. This is what she said on election night\n\nI was running ... I was that person running for my life across a parking lot, running from an abuser. I remember hearing bullets whizz past my head and at that moment I wondered: \"How do I make it out of this life?\"\n\nI was uninsured. I've been that uninsured person, hoping my healthcare provider wouldn't embarrass me by asking me if I had insurance. I wondered: \"How will I bear it?\"\n\nI was a single parent. I've been that single parent struggling paycheck to paycheck, sitting outside the payday loan office, wondering \"how much more will I have to sacrifice?\"\n\nI was that Covid patient. I've been that Covid patient gasping for breath, wondering, \"How long will it be until I can breathe freely again?\"\n\nI'm still that same person. I'm proud to stand before you today knowing it was this person, with these experiences, that moved the voters of St Louis to do something historic. St Louis: my city, my home, my community. We have been surviving and grinding and just scraping by for so long, and now this is our moment to finally, finally start living and growing and thriving. So, as the first Black woman, nurse, and single mother to have the honor to represent Missouri in the United States Congress, let me just say this. To the Black women. The Black girls. The nurses. The single mothers. The essential workers. This. Is. OUR. Moment.\n\nSix years ago, St Louis captured the eyes and ears of the entire world during the Ferguson uprising. We could not stand the injustice any longer, so - in the tradition of every one of our ancestors who fought for a better world - we organized for Michael Brown, Jr. We organized for 400 days, side by side, arm in arm, St Louis strong. And now in the face of a global pandemic and relentless attacks on our right to vote, we organized all the way to the ballot box. We mailed in our ballots, we voted absentee, we reached our families, friends, neighbors, and peers - and we showed up ... St Louis strong.\n\nFor years, we've lived under leadership that shut us out of our own government. For years, we've been left out in the cold: protesting in the streets, sleeping in our cars or tents, working three part-time jobs just to pay the bills. And today, today , we, all of us, are headed to Congress - St Louis strong!\n\nMy message today is to every Black, Brown, immigrant, queer, and trans person, and to every person locked out of opportunities to thrive because of oppressive systems; I'm here to serve you. To every person who knows what it's like to give a loved one that \"just make it home safely baby\" talk; I love you.\n\nTo every parent facing a choice between putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their head; I'm here to serve you. To every precious child in our failing foster system: I love you.\n\nTo every teacher doing the impossible to teach through this pandemic; I'm here to serve you. To every student struggling to the finish line; I love you.\n\nTo every differently abled person denied equal access; I love you.\n\nTo every person living unhoused on the streets; I love you.\n\nTo every family that's lost someone to gun violence; I love you.\n\nTo every person who's lost a job, or a home, or healthcare, or hope; I love you.\n\nIt is the greatest honor of my life to accept the responsibility to serve every single person across Missouri's first congressional district, as your first-ever Black congresswoman-elect. This is our moment.\n\nTonight, we the people are victorious. We, we the people are going to Congress. Because we the people have committed to a vision of America that works for all of us. An America that treats every person with respect. That recognizes healthcare as a human right. That believes every person deserves food to eat, a home to live in, and a dignified life. Our America will be led not by the small-mindedness of a powerful few, but the imagination of a mass movement that includes all of us. That is the America we are fighting for.\n\nEverything I do begins with those who have the least, who've suffered the worst, and who have the greatest to offer. Why? Because I myself have lived paycheck to paycheck. I struggled for years under the burden of student debt. I've been evicted by landlords. I've worried about how I was going to put food on the table for my two kids. I've been underinsured and uninsured. And for every one of those stories that I can tell you about my life, I know there are thousands more in our community. And those are the stories that I am carrying with me and will uplift in the People's House as your congresswoman.\n\nIt is my job now to serve you - not just lead, not just demand, but serve you.\n\nThis moment is brought to us by us - by our movement for social, racial and economic justice. Now, our movement is going to Congress. And we will meet the challenges of this moment as a movement: side by side, arm in arm, and with our fists in the air - ready to serve each other until every single one of us is free.\n\nThis is a written version of the victory speech Cori Bush gave on 3 November"

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush Ousted By AIPAC-Backed Primary Challenger\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) lost her Democratic primary on Tuesday, shrinking the ranks of the House's left-wing \"Squad\" and delivering another major victory to the pro-Israel and business-friendly groups that backed her challenger.\n\nWesley Bell, the St. Louis County prosecutor, defeated Bush. Since Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which includes all of St. Louis and many of its northern and western suburbs, is overwhelmingly Democratic, Bell is all but assured of a seat in Congress come November.\n\nBell's victory over Bush marks the second \"Squad\" member in recent months to fall to a challenger heavily funded by pro-Israel groups. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), who, like Bush , ousted an incumbent in 2020, lost his race to Westchester County Executive George Latimer this past June.\n\nJustice Democrats, the left-wing group that backed Bush's first successful run, cast the race as yet another referendum on the power of big money to decide elections.\n\n\"This race is about the future of our democracy and the soul of our Democratic Party, frankly,\" Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, told HuffPost on Monday. \"This is a question about whether we want to let a handful of Republican mega-donors dictate the outcome of Democratic primaries, or do we want to move forward to elect more nurses and everyday people to represent the community's best interests.\"\n\nBush, an ordained pastor and registered nurse, indeed faced a massive fundraising deficit. As Andrabi noted, Bell had the support of some local Republican donors - and many national megadonors from both parties, through the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nSuper PACs supporting Bell outspent those supporting Bush by a more than 3-to-1 margin . Spending by pro-Bell groups included about $8.6 million from AIPAC's United Democracy Project, $1.5 million from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman's Mainstream Democrats PAC, $1.4 million from the crypto-industry-backed FairShake PAC, and nearly $500,000 from the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC.\n\nBush made national waves with her July 2021 sit-in on the U.S. Capitol steps to draw attention to the expiration of the federal government's COVID-19-era eviction moratorium. Her action got results; President Joe Biden responded by extending the policy , though the Supreme Court stopped it a few weeks later .\n\nLater that year, in a bid to shore up support for abortion rights, Bush spoke on national television - and in a House hearing - about her experience getting an abortion after being raped at age 17.\n\n\"What St. Louis needs right now in their congressperson is not so much a vocal advocate, but a facilitator.\"\n\nBush's allies - and she retains the support of many local elected officials - see her as an authentic tribune of the Black Lives Matter movement , which was born in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014.\n\nUnlike many other Democrats in Washington, Bush continues to embrace calls to \"defund the police.\"\n\nBell, who also got his political start during the Ferguson protests and unseated a more conservative incumbent prosecutor in 2018, has, by contrast, disappointed many of his former fellow activists. They fault him for declining to prosecute Darren Wilson, the police officer who killed Brown, and for not more rapidly reducing the county's jail and prison populations, even as he points to the creation of a conviction review unit and the expansion of drug diversion programs .\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying they both come from the movement,\" said St. Louis Alderman Rasheen Aldridge, a Ferguson alum and Bush supporter. \"I would say there's somebody like Cori Bush, who was a front-liner, who was actually in the movement, and there's somebody like Bell who was using the movement as a stepping stone for another seat.\"\n\nBut Bush also had weaknesses that gave her ideological adversaries an opening.\n\nDMFI PAC's polling found Bush leading Bell by 16 percentage points in January, but still only getting 45% of the vote. By late July, the group had Bell leading Bush by six percentage points ― a close approximation of the final outcome.\n\n\"There was clear evidence in the polling, she was very vulnerable,\" said Mark Mellman, president of DMFI, and a veteran campaign pollster.\n\nBush's vulnerabilities included her vote against President Joe Biden 's bipartisan infrastructure law. While she and the other five progressives who voted against it say they meant to pressure Biden to pass broader social and climate legislation, attack ad s papered over those nuances to paint Bush as a party turncoat.\n\nPerhaps trying to offset the impact of this vote, Bush erected signs claiming she had \"delivered over $2 billion\" to the district. But with an assist from DMFI, local TV station KDSK reported in June that Bush's team had counted virtually all federal grant and American Rescue Plan Act money that had come into the district during her time in Congress, the vast majority of which she had little direct role in allocating. Bush's staff later took down at least one of the signs.\n\nIn addition, Bush faces a Department of Justice investigation for improperly spending more than $750,000 in campaign funds on private security services from a firm run by a man who was her romantic partner and is now her husband.\n\nFederal campaign finance law allows candidates to hire family members as vendors as long as they are providing an authentic service at a market rate. Bush, who says she needs private security due to the death threats she receives, insists that the business agreement is above board. The House Ethics Committee also recommended no charges against her in October.\n\nBut in leaked audio of a January meeting with some of her aides in which Bush pleaded for them to remain with her, she acknowledged the arrangement might look \"messed up\" to some people.\n\nIronically, former Rep. William \"Lacy\" Clay, who Bush unseated in 2020, elicited scrutiny for a similar practice, albeit without the justification of personal safety. His campaign had shelled out so much money to his sister's law firm for legal expenses, Bush was able to outspend him on television in the final two weeks of the race.\n\nFinally, Bush has been among the most outspoken critics of Israel in Congress, particularly after Israel invaded Gaza in response to Hamas' terror attack on Oct. 7. She was not only an early advocate for a ceasefire, but has also accused Israel of genocide ― a charge that remains highly disputed. And in an interview with The New York Times out on Monday, Bush expressed ambivalence about describing Hamas as a terrorist group, though her campaign later walked it back.\n\n\"Would they qualify to me as a terrorist organization? Yes,\" Bush told the Times. \"But do I know that? Absolutely not.\"\n\nBush's stances cost her the support of Susan Talve , a progressive St. Louis rabbi who previously backed her and has strong ties to Black leaders. But they also unsettled some other allies who see her national profile as a distraction from the needs of the high-poverty, majority Black district.\n\nDarryl Gray, a local pastor and social justice advocate who ran Bush's failed Senate campaign in 2016 and has voted for her ever since, is a prominent former ally now backing Bell.\n\n\"As an advocate on national issues, she gets an A+. She has been vocal and present and 10 toes in around issues that all of us ought to be concerned about ― from Palestine to housing,\" Gray said Monday. \"What St. Louis needs right now in their congressperson is not so much a vocal advocate, but a facilitator, a leader locally that can bring other elected officials and community partners to a table to address and hopefully solve local issues.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush's Democratic Challenger Once Managed A GOP Congressional Campaign\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWesley Bell, a St. Louis prosecutor who is mounting a formidable Democratic primary challenge against Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), is campaigning as someone who will produce more tangible results for the district while sharing many of her same left-leaning values.\n\nBut one line on Bell's political resume is at odds with his promise to champion a progressive agenda. In 2006, Bell managed the campaign of a conservative Republican running for the same seat Bell is seeking today.\n\nThe candidate, Mark J. Byrne, ran as a fierce abortion opponent and gun rights crusader. \"I intend to protect the rights of the unborn,\" his campaign website read. \"I believe that there is no greater job for elected representatives.\"\n\nHe ultimately lost to incumbent Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., who remained in office until Bush successfully challenged him in 2020.\n\n\"Nearly 20 years ago, Wesley helped a longtime friend by volunteering with his campaign, in spite of their differences in political affiliations and positions on many issues,\" said Anjan Mukherjee, a spokesperson for Bell's campaign. \"Wesley has been a progressive prosecutor, working to overturn wrongful convictions and refusing to prosecute women for abortions, and he will be a progressive member of Congress who works with President Biden.\"\n\nByrne, who is now a municipal judge in a neighboring county, said Bell ran his campaign as a friendly favor. The two met as young lawyers in St. Louis County, he recalled, and became friends over years of poker nights.\n\n\"He didn't run a Republican's campaign, he ran a friend's campaign,\" Byrne said in an interview this week with HuffPost. \"He and I didn't see eye to eye on political issues, but he did the best that he could to try to help me get elected.\"\n\nBell has avoided any mention of the Byrne campaign as he crisscrosses Missouri's bright-blue 1st Congressional District, which includes St. Louis and Ferguson, the birthplace of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.\n\nBush and Bell both emerged from the Ferguson uprising as political leaders. And the primary has mostly revolved around their dueling claims to better represent progressive voters. In her four years in Congress, Bush, a former nurse, rallied national support for a COVID-era eviction moratorium and led the first calls for a cease-fire in the ongoing fighting in Gaza. Bell, claiming Bush gets better headlines than results, is campaigning on his record as the St. Louis County prosecutor, a role in which he pursued alternatives to incarceration for people convicted of minor offenses.\n\nSupporters of Bush argue Bell is not a genuine progressive but the Democrat preferred by Republicans.\n\n\"Bell's willingness to defend abortion rights depends solely on how it helps his own political career,\" said Usamah Andrabi, the spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a grassroots group supporting Bush. \"There is no excuse that can justify leading the campaign to elect a Republican extremist.\"\n\nAs of May, Bell has raised more than $65,000 in contributions from donors who normally give to Republicans. They include a former GOP speaker of the Missouri House, the billionaire hedge fund founder Daniel Loeb, and the former finance chair for Sen. Tim Scott 's (R-S.C.) presidential super PAC.\n\nAt the end of the last fundraising quarter, Bell reported having about twice as much cash on hand as Bush.\n\nBell has also benefited from more than $300,000 in ads paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's super PAC. While AIPAC backs candidates of both parties who support U.S. military assistance for Israel, progressive critics have noted the PAC's top contributors are GOP megadonors. Bush is one of AIPAC's top targets in the 2024 elections.\n\n\"The fact that my 'Democratic' opponent's entrance into politics was managing a Republican congressional campaign for a far-right, anti-abortion extremist is strikingly consistent, and it should tell voters everything they need to know,\" Bush said in a statement. \"He can't be trusted to protect our reproductive freedoms and abortion rights, secure our democracy, and stand up to the MAGA Republican extremists in Congress.\"\n\n\"He and I didn't see eye to eye on political issues, but he did the best that he could to try to help me get elected.\"\n\nBell's 2006 stint as a GOP campaign hand fell during a historic wave year for Democrats. Amid deepening anger over President George W. Bush's mishandling of the war in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina and a drumbeat of Republican scandals, Democrats easily recaptured the House and Senate.\n\nByrne, the candidate Bell worked for, epitomized the kind of staunch conservative voters rejected.\n\n\"I am pro-life and I will support a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of the unborn,\" Byrne told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"I will protect our Second Amendment right to bear arms. ... I will increase funding for the border patrol and crack down on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\"\n\nWhen the Post-Dispatch editorial board supported his more moderate primary rival, Byrne's campaign spun it as a \"wonderful endorsement\" of his \"strongly conservative positions.\"\n\n\"The Post is correct,\" his campaign website read. \"While some may waver on their positions, Mark will not compromise his integrity just to become the 'moderate' candidate.\"\n\nByrne won the primary. But as a first-time political candidate in a Democratic stronghold, he proved a weak match for Clay, whose father had held the same congressional seat for 32 years before him.\n\nByrne now denies he ran a right-wing conservative campaign, and argues that Bell's role in his congressional bid shouldn't hurt his own political future.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Cori Bush And Rashida Tlaib Speak Alongside Student Protesters\n\nReporter\n\nCongresswomen Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) joined George Washington University student protestors for a press conference on Wednesday, less than a day after cleared pro-Palestine demonstrators' encampment from the school grounds.\n\nDuring the press conference outside the U.S. Capitol, Bush and Tlaib condemned the dismissive response that members of Congress have had towards the national mobilization of pro-Palestine student protestors over the past several weeks.\n\n\"It is incredibly disturbing that my colleagues are so quick to denounce the student protestors, but are silent about ... why they are protesting,\" Tlaib said.\n\nOver the past several weeks, students at universities across the country have held demonstrations and set up encampments on their school grounds to protest Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza, which have killed more than 35,000 people so far.\n\nWhile student demands vary by campuses across the U.S., most are demanding that their colleges denounce the Israeli offensive as a genocide against Palestinians, increase transparency around financial and academic ties to Israel and divest from companies linked to Israel .\n\n\"We will not stop in defending these students until [there is an] end in regards to the genocide, ... [and] until there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire that includes complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza,\" Tlaib said. \"We're proud to use our positions in office to bring these voices, so you all don't forget why they're encampments, why there are movements and dissent around this country.\"\n\nSome protestors have successfully been able to reach agreements with their colleges, such as at Northwestern University, Brown University and University of Minnesota .

More than 2,100 people have been arrested during pro-Palestine protests on college campuses nationwide, according to an Associated Press tally last week.\n\n\"Those who refuse to stop the ongoing genocide in Gaza think they can arrest and brutalize their way out of this situation,\" Bush said on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives have slammed the demonstrators as antisemitic, and have launched an investigation into the protests, the Washington Post reported .\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also called out antisemitism on college campuses .

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush's Democratic Challenger Is Raising Big Bucks - From Republicans\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn his Democratic primary challenge to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Wesley Bell , the St. Louis County prosecutor, is raising money hand over fist - and not all of it from Democrats.\n\nBell's latest campaign finance filings include donations from notable sources such as Steven Tilley, a GOP former Missouri House speaker who's now a lobbyist, and Daniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Third Point, who has donated millions to Republican causes.\n\nDavid Steward, a billionaire tech CEO from St. Louis, has also supported Bell . Steward recently served as the finance chair of a super PAC that supported Sen. Tim Scott's (R-S.C.) run for president.\n\nAll told, Bell raised more than $65,000 from donors who also gave to one of Missouri's two Republican senators, Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, in their most recent campaigns, or Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, the leading Republican candidate for governor.\n\nThe influx of money for Bell from donors who normally back Republicans comes after the prosecutor abandoned a Senate campaign against Hawley in order to challenge Bush.\n\nBell jumped races in late October, a decision he partly credits to Bush's stance on Israel's military action in Gaza. Shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Bush introduced a resolution for a cease-fire and condemned Israel's retaliatory military action as an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\"\n\nAround that time, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the deep-pocketed pro-Israel lobbying group, unveiled a plan to spend up to $100 million to unseat Bush and her fellow Israel critics. The group endorsed Bell in February.\n\n\"Wesley Bell is a progressive prosecutor who will stand up for President Biden's agenda and oppose MAGA extremists and Donald Trump ― and everyone who supports or donates to his campaign knows that's exactly what to expect from Wesley,\" said Anjan Mukherjee, an adviser to Bell's campaign. \"Cori Bush has proven she would rather get headlines and protest than do the work of getting progressive results for St. Louis.\"\n\nBell's fundraising is part of a trend of Democratic primary challengers drawing financial support from Republican donors when they face off against big-name progressives.\n\nBhavini Patel, a Pittsburgh-area councilmember who challenged \"Squad\" member Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) in her April primary, got a six-figure boost from Republican billionaire Jeffrey Yass and a super PAC he funded - support that may have ultimately backfired. Lee campaigned on the fact that her opponent appealed to one of Trump's closest allies, and she beat Patel by a wide margin .\n\nBush, a nurse, became a political activist after the 2014 police killing of Mike Brown and the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Missouri. In 2020, with support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and progressive groups that helped elect other left-wing Squad members, Bush pulled off a shocking upset of longtime incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay Jr. She has become an advocate for Black maternal health, abortion rights and diverting money from law enforcement to public services.\n\nBell's political career was forged in Ferguson, too, where he became a city councilmember after the unrest. In 2018, Bell rode a wave of enthusiasm for progressive prosecutor candidates to become the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney. Bell is campaigning on elements of his record, such as his efforts to reduce the number of people jailed for minor offenses. But some activists who helped elect him claim he failed to differ much from his predecessors, starting with when he declined to seek charges over Brown's death.\n\nIn deep-blue St. Louis, the winner of the August primary is almost certainly headed to Congress.\n\n\"My view is that Cori Bush is just too extreme,\" Larry Absheer, a St. Louis donor who crossed party lines to donate to Bell, said in an interview. \"For whatever reason, she's on the anti-Israel bandwagon. While Wesley, I'm sure he and I disagree on a lot of things, I think he'd be a much better candidate. ... He seems like a reasonable young man.\"\n\nBush may be a more vulnerable target than other Squad members. Her 2021 vote against the Biden administration's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act angered some local unions, a number of which are now endorsing Bell. Bush also came under fire in 2022 for fundraising alongside a local activist who once posted about destroying Israel \"along with every Israeli in it.\"\n\nIn January, reports revealed the Justice Department is investigating Bush's use of campaign funds to pay for security services, including hiring her husband for security work. A previous investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics concluded that the spending was appropriate given the volume of threats she faced.\n\nFueled in part by AIPAC's endorsement, Bell has far outpaced Bush in fundraising; his campaign ended April with $1.1 million cash on hand to her $528,000. Bell has received more than $360,000 in individual contributions earmarked as having been directed to his campaign through AIPAC.\n\nBell \"went from running for Senate against far-right Josh Hawley to courting Josh Hawley's far-right donors instead, in a run against one of only two federally elected Democrats in Missouri,\" said a campaign spokesperson for Bush. \"His candidacy is nothing more than a Trojan horse for more right-wing extremism and will do nothing but hurt communities like St. Louis that he's auditioning to serve in Congress.\"\n\nBush and other progressives have accused AIPAC of laundering Republican money into their primaries. Its donors hail from both parties, but a significant number are GOP megadonors, such as Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus and hedge fund manager Paul Singer. The United Democracy Project, AIPAC's super PAC, raised record donations last year, starting the election season with a whopping $41 million in ready cash.\n\nBush called on Democratic primary candidates to reject AIPAC's support in a January interview with HuffPost.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Democratic Congresswoman Calls Out House For Censuring Rashida Tlaib\n\nReporter\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush (D-Mo.) criticized members of Congress on Tuesday for their attempt to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) over her comments on the Israel-Palestine war.\n\nBush's comments arrived hours before the House officially passed the censure resolution Tuesday evening.\n\n\"I rise today in opposition to the censure resolution and also [in] opposition to the reckless manner that people in this House speak when they don't realize or don't care that they put targets on the backs of actual people,\" Bush said to the House of Representatives, pointing out a lack of care, understanding and sense of humanity towards Black and brown people such as Tlaib.\n\n\"It's outrageous that my colleagues are blatantly attempting to silence the only Palestinian American representative right here,\" continued Bush, who has also received criticism over her own comments about the war.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas, a militant group based in Gaza, launched a surprise attack on Israel, igniting an ongoing war. Since the initial attack, Israel has bombarded and invaded the Gaza Strip. The war has resulted in thousands of deaths of Israelis and Palestinians on both sides.\n\nTlaib has been a staunch supporter of Palestinians and has publicly criticized Israel in its ongoing war with Hamas, denouncing it as an apartheid state and calling for an end to the occupation. She has also demanded for a cease-fire with the Palestinian death toll surpassing 10,000, and continuing to rise.\n\nLawmakers have labeled Tlaib's criticisms of Israel as antisemitic, and introduced two separate censure resolutions against Tlaib, as part of a broader effort from the party to link progressive lawmakers, Muslims and Arabs to Hamas. The second measure that passed Tuesday was introduced by Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ohio).\n\nLast week, Tlaib posted a video using the Palestinian slogan, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which critics interpret as a call for the eradication of Israel.\n\n\"From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate,\" she tweeted on Friday, defending her use of the slogan. \"My work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all people no matter faith or ethnicity.\"\n\nMcCormick's censure resolution against Tlaib accused her of \"promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.\"\n\nA censure is a formal statement of disapproval, but does not carry any material punishments such as removal from office, according to PBS .\n\n\"It's a shame my colleagues are more focused on silencing me than they are on saving lives, as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 10,000,\" Tlaib said in a statement before the resolution vote. \"Many of them have shown me that Palestinian lives simply do not matter to them, but I still do not police their rhetoric or actions.\"\n\nThe House had initially rejected the Democratic motion to set aside the censure resolution after a vote of 213 to 208, because 11 lawmakers were absent ― eight of them Democrats ― but the passing 234-188 vote came after enough Democrats joined with Republicans.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush Ousted By AIPAC-Backed Primary Challenger\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) lost her Democratic primary on Tuesday, shrinking the ranks of the House's left-wing \"Squad\" and delivering another major victory to the pro-Israel and business-friendly groups that backed her challenger.\n\nWesley Bell, the St. Louis County prosecutor, defeated Bush. Since Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which includes all of St. Louis and many of its northern and western suburbs, is overwhelmingly Democratic, Bell is all but assured of a seat in Congress come November.\n\nBell's victory over Bush marks the second \"Squad\" member in recent months to fall to a challenger heavily funded by pro-Israel groups. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), who, like Bush , ousted an incumbent in 2020, lost his race to Westchester County Executive George Latimer this past June.\n\nJustice Democrats, the left-wing group that backed Bush's first successful run, cast the race as yet another referendum on the power of big money to decide elections.\n\n\"This race is about the future of our democracy and the soul of our Democratic Party, frankly,\" Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, told HuffPost on Monday. \"This is a question about whether we want to let a handful of Republican mega-donors dictate the outcome of Democratic primaries, or do we want to move forward to elect more nurses and everyday people to represent the community's best interests.\"\n\nBush, an ordained pastor and registered nurse, indeed faced a massive fundraising deficit. As Andrabi noted, Bell had the support of some local Republican donors - and many national megadonors from both parties, through the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nSuper PACs supporting Bell outspent those supporting Bush by a more than 3-to-1 margin . Spending by pro-Bell groups included about $8.6 million from AIPAC's United Democracy Project, $1.5 million from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman's Mainstream Democrats PAC, $1.4 million from the crypto-industry-backed FairShake PAC, and nearly $500,000 from the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC.\n\nBush made national waves with her July 2021 sit-in on the U.S. Capitol steps to draw attention to the expiration of the federal government's COVID-19-era eviction moratorium. Her action got results; President Joe Biden responded by extending the policy , though the Supreme Court stopped it a few weeks later .\n\nLater that year, in a bid to shore up support for abortion rights, Bush spoke on national television - and in a House hearing - about her experience getting an abortion after being raped at age 17.\n\n\"What St. Louis needs right now in their congressperson is not so much a vocal advocate, but a facilitator.\"\n\nBush's allies - and she retains the support of many local elected officials - see her as an authentic tribune of the Black Lives Matter movement , which was born in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014.\n\nUnlike many other Democrats in Washington, Bush continues to embrace calls to \"defund the police.\"\n\nBell, who also got his political start during the Ferguson protests and unseated a more conservative incumbent prosecutor in 2018, has, by contrast, disappointed many of his former fellow activists. They fault him for declining to prosecute Darren Wilson, the police officer who killed Brown, and for not more rapidly reducing the county's jail and prison populations, even as he points to the creation of a conviction review unit and the expansion of drug diversion programs .\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying they both come from the movement,\" said St. Louis Alderman Rasheen Aldridge, a Ferguson alum and Bush supporter. \"I would say there's somebody like Cori Bush, who was a front-liner, who was actually in the movement, and there's somebody like Bell who was using the movement as a stepping stone for another seat.\"\n\nBut Bush also had weaknesses that gave her ideological adversaries an opening.\n\nDMFI PAC's polling found Bush leading Bell by 16 percentage points in January, but still only getting 45% of the vote. By late July, the group had Bell leading Bush by six percentage points ― a close approximation of the final outcome.\n\n\"There was clear evidence in the polling, she was very vulnerable,\" said Mark Mellman, president of DMFI, and a veteran campaign pollster.\n\nBush's vulnerabilities included her vote against President Joe Biden 's bipartisan infrastructure law. While she and the other five progressives who voted against it say they meant to pressure Biden to pass broader social and climate legislation, attack ad s papered over those nuances to paint Bush as a party turncoat.\n\nPerhaps trying to offset the impact of this vote, Bush erected signs claiming she had \"delivered over $2 billion\" to the district. But with an assist from DMFI, local TV station KDSK reported in June that Bush's team had counted virtually all federal grant and American Rescue Plan Act money that had come into the district during her time in Congress, the vast majority of which she had little direct role in allocating. Bush's staff later took down at least one of the signs.\n\nIn addition, Bush faces a Department of Justice investigation for improperly spending more than $750,000 in campaign funds on private security services from a firm run by a man who was her romantic partner and is now her husband.\n\nFederal campaign finance law allows candidates to hire family members as vendors as long as they are providing an authentic service at a market rate. Bush, who says she needs private security due to the death threats she receives, insists that the business agreement is above board. The House Ethics Committee also recommended no charges against her in October.\n\nBut in leaked audio of a January meeting with some of her aides in which Bush pleaded for them to remain with her, she acknowledged the arrangement might look \"messed up\" to some people.\n\nIronically, former Rep. William \"Lacy\" Clay, who Bush unseated in 2020, elicited scrutiny for a similar practice, albeit without the justification of personal safety. His campaign had shelled out so much money to his sister's law firm for legal expenses, Bush was able to outspend him on television in the final two weeks of the race.\n\nFinally, Bush has been among the most outspoken critics of Israel in Congress, particularly after Israel invaded Gaza in response to Hamas' terror attack on Oct. 7. She was not only an early advocate for a ceasefire, but has also accused Israel of genocide ― a charge that remains highly disputed. And in an interview with The New York Times out on Monday, Bush expressed ambivalence about describing Hamas as a terrorist group, though her campaign later walked it back.\n\n\"Would they qualify to me as a terrorist organization? Yes,\" Bush told the Times. \"But do I know that? Absolutely not.\"\n\nBush's stances cost her the support of Susan Talve , a progressive St. Louis rabbi who previously backed her and has strong ties to Black leaders. But they also unsettled some other allies who see her national profile as a distraction from the needs of the high-poverty, majority Black district.\n\nDarryl Gray, a local pastor and social justice advocate who ran Bush's failed Senate campaign in 2016 and has voted for her ever since, is a prominent former ally now backing Bell.\n\n\"As an advocate on national issues, she gets an A+. She has been vocal and present and 10 toes in around issues that all of us ought to be concerned about ― from Palestine to housing,\" Gray said Monday. \"What St. Louis needs right now in their congressperson is not so much a vocal advocate, but a facilitator, a leader locally that can bring other elected officials and community partners to a table to address and hopefully solve local issues.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush Says Republicans Are Using Black Speaker Candidate As 'Prop'\n\nSenior Diplomatic Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) blasted Republicans on Wednesday for claiming to advance racial equality amid their infighting in the House of Representatives, saying they were using her fellow Black lawmaker Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) as \"a prop.\"\n\nConservative members who refuse to back Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as the new speaker of the House rallied around Donalds on Wednesday, giving him 20 votes for the speakership in the fourth and fifth rounds of voting. While nominating Donalds, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) referenced civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. and said that Republicans \"do not seek to judge people by the color of their skin but rather the content of their character.\"\n\nThe nomination meant that for the first time in history, both major parties nominated a Black candidate to run the House. Democrats backed Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), who leads their caucus.\n\nBut Bush noted on Twitter that GOP policies offer little else to combat racism and structural inequities. \"Despite being Black, [Donalds] supports a policy agenda intent on upholding and perpetuating white supremacy,\" the Missouri Democrat argued.\n\nShe later expanded on her comments ― and conservative pushback to her tweet ― to HuffPost.\n\n\"My issue is not with Byron Donalds himself. My issue is not with him being Black. My issue is not with him being Republican. My issue is because he was not someone that they have been promoting for the last two years,\" Bush said.\n\nFWIW, @ByronDonalds is not a historic candidate for Speaker. He is a prop. Despite being Black, he supports a policy agenda intent on upholding and perpetuating white supremacy. His name being in the mix is not progress-it's pathetic.\n\nThough it is unclear who Republicans will ultimately settle on for speaker, it is extremely unlikely that their choice will be Donalds, who has only served one term in Congress. Far-right figures are also pushing for Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and other more prominent alternatives.\n\nThe congresswoman noted that in claiming to be sincerely promoting Donalds, GOP lawmakers spoke about his niceness, background ― like Jeffries, Donalds is from New York ― and his past struggles.\n\n\"It seems as if they're using him as a prop, as a tool, not because they think that he's great, that he's done all of these things to lead them,\" Bush said. \"I don't like that they're using him that way. I don't want them to use him that way. And I want him to understand: They're only using you... don't let them do that to you. Make them treat you with dignity and respect.\"\n\nShe continued: \"To hear Chip Roy stand up and say this is not about color ... it absolutely 100% is because if you were nominating him on his worth and merit, I think none of us would have been surprised because we would have seen him do leadership things.\"\n\nThe congresswoman deflected conservative criticism of her remarks.\n\n\"I'm glad they took offense because it shows their lack of knowledge. It shows how ignorant they are. I need them to read up and understand what white supremacy is, what it looks like, and what the patriarchal system looks like,\" Bush added.\n\nDonalds is a hardcore supporter of Donald Trump , the former president who questioned the citizenship of the country's first Black president, pledged to ban Muslims from entering American borders, referred to COVID-19 as \"kung flu,\" cast Mexican immigrants as rapists and frequently spurred on white nationalists.\n\nDonalds supported Trump's false claim that the 2020 presidential election was illegitimate, voting to reject state-certified results from Arizona and Pennsylvania. He is close with controversial Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and has opposed gun control and the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The notice did not specify what kind of documents were being sought or why.\n\nPunchbowl News reported that the investigation into Bush is about the use of her member's representation allowance, a pot of money given to each House member for their office expenses in Washington and back in their home districts. However, Bush's statement indicated that the probe was focused on her campaign spending.\n\n\"As a rank-and-file member of Congress I am not entitled to personal protection by the House, and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services,\" Bush said. \"I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services.\"\n\nBush has faced scrutiny for paying her husband, Cortney Merritts, tens of thousands from her campaign account for \"security services.\" She spent nearly $130,000 from her campaign account on private security in the first nine months of 2023, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThough paying family members with campaign funds is legal, candidates are required to pay the fair market rate for their services - not more, not less.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush's Democratic Challenger Is Raising Big Bucks - From Republicans\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn his Democratic primary challenge to Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Wesley Bell , the St. Louis County prosecutor, is raising money hand over fist - and not all of it from Democrats.\n\nBell's latest campaign finance filings include donations from notable sources such as Steven Tilley, a GOP former Missouri House speaker who's now a lobbyist, and Daniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Third Point, who has donated millions to Republican causes.\n\nDavid Steward, a billionaire tech CEO from St. Louis, has also supported Bell . Steward recently served as the finance chair of a super PAC that supported Sen. Tim Scott's (R-S.C.) run for president.\n\nAll told, Bell raised more than $65,000 from donors who also gave to one of Missouri's two Republican senators, Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, in their most recent campaigns, or Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, the leading Republican candidate for governor.\n\nThe influx of money for Bell from donors who normally back Republicans comes after the prosecutor abandoned a Senate campaign against Hawley in order to challenge Bush.\n\nBell jumped races in late October, a decision he partly credits to Bush's stance on Israel's military action in Gaza. Shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Bush introduced a resolution for a cease-fire and condemned Israel's retaliatory military action as an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\"\n\nAround that time, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the deep-pocketed pro-Israel lobbying group, unveiled a plan to spend up to $100 million to unseat Bush and her fellow Israel critics. The group endorsed Bell in February.\n\n\"Wesley Bell is a progressive prosecutor who will stand up for President Biden's agenda and oppose MAGA extremists and Donald Trump ― and everyone who supports or donates to his campaign knows that's exactly what to expect from Wesley,\" said Anjan Mukherjee, an adviser to Bell's campaign. \"Cori Bush has proven she would rather get headlines and protest than do the work of getting progressive results for St. Louis.\"\n\nBell's fundraising is part of a trend of Democratic primary challengers drawing financial support from Republican donors when they face off against big-name progressives.\n\nBhavini Patel, a Pittsburgh-area councilmember who challenged \"Squad\" member Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) in her April primary, got a six-figure boost from Republican billionaire Jeffrey Yass and a super PAC he funded - support that may have ultimately backfired. Lee campaigned on the fact that her opponent appealed to one of Trump's closest allies, and she beat Patel by a wide margin .\n\nBush, a nurse, became a political activist after the 2014 police killing of Mike Brown and the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Missouri. In 2020, with support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and progressive groups that helped elect other left-wing Squad members, Bush pulled off a shocking upset of longtime incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay Jr. She has become an advocate for Black maternal health, abortion rights and diverting money from law enforcement to public services.\n\nBell's political career was forged in Ferguson, too, where he became a city councilmember after the unrest. In 2018, Bell rode a wave of enthusiasm for progressive prosecutor candidates to become the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney. Bell is campaigning on elements of his record, such as his efforts to reduce the number of people jailed for minor offenses. But some activists who helped elect him claim he failed to differ much from his predecessors, starting with when he declined to seek charges over Brown's death.\n\nIn deep-blue St. Louis, the winner of the August primary is almost certainly headed to Congress.\n\n\"My view is that Cori Bush is just too extreme,\" Larry Absheer, a St. Louis donor who crossed party lines to donate to Bell, said in an interview. \"For whatever reason, she's on the anti-Israel bandwagon. While Wesley, I'm sure he and I disagree on a lot of things, I think he'd be a much better candidate. ... He seems like a reasonable young man.\"\n\nBush may be a more vulnerable target than other Squad members. Her 2021 vote against the Biden administration's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act angered some local unions, a number of which are now endorsing Bell. Bush also came under fire in 2022 for fundraising alongside a local activist who once posted about destroying Israel \"along with every Israeli in it.\"\n\nIn January, reports revealed the Justice Department is investigating Bush's use of campaign funds to pay for security services, including hiring her husband for security work. A previous investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics concluded that the spending was appropriate given the volume of threats she faced.\n\nFueled in part by AIPAC's endorsement, Bell has far outpaced Bush in fundraising; his campaign ended April with $1.1 million cash on hand to her $528,000. Bell has received more than $360,000 in individual contributions earmarked as having been directed to his campaign through AIPAC.\n\nBell \"went from running for Senate against far-right Josh Hawley to courting Josh Hawley's far-right donors instead, in a run against one of only two federally elected Democrats in Missouri,\" said a campaign spokesperson for Bush. \"His candidacy is nothing more than a Trojan horse for more right-wing extremism and will do nothing but hurt communities like St. Louis that he's auditioning to serve in Congress.\"\n\nBush and other progressives have accused AIPAC of laundering Republican money into their primaries. Its donors hail from both parties, but a significant number are GOP megadonors, such as Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus and hedge fund manager Paul Singer. The United Democracy Project, AIPAC's super PAC, raised record donations last year, starting the election season with a whopping $41 million in ready cash.\n\nBush called on Democratic primary candidates to reject AIPAC's support in a January interview with HuffPost.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "AIPAC Millions Take Down Second Squad Member Cori Bush\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBush was early calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war on Gaza. Then AIPAC came after her with millions of dollars.\n\nMissouri Democratic Rep. Cori Bush narrowly lost the Democratic congressional primary on Tuesday against St. Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell, a challenger backed by the leading pro-Israel lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The race was AIPAC's second targeted attack on a Squad member this cycle.\n\nWith roughly 95 percent of precincts reporting election results, Bush trailed by less than 6,000 of the 112,000 cast. The Associated Press called the race two hours after polls closed.\n\nAfter spending more than $17 million to topple Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., in June, AIPAC shifted its focus toward ousting Bush. The group poured more than $8 million into the race to unseat Bush in less than two months.\n\nOutside groups dumped $18.2 million into the race. Bell's backers outspent groups supporting Bush roughly 4 to 1. AIPAC's super PAC spent $8.5 million backing Bell's campaign. Democratic Majority for Israel PAC spent half a million, and major Democratic donor Reid Hoffman's Mainstream Democrats PAC spent $1.5 million in support of Bell.\n\nJustice Democrats and the Working Families Party spent just under $3 million in support of Bush\n\nThe infusion of cash made the race the fourth most expensive primary in House history, according to the Working Families Party.\n\nAIPAC's money was spent on voter engagement efforts and phone banking in addition to digital and mail ads. One of the mailers, first reported by The Intercept, included images that distorted Bush's features. AIPAC also helped bundle at least two-thirds of Bell's campaign haul, Sludge reported.\n\nBush's loss marks another victory for a pro-Israel movement seeking to silence critics of Israel's human rights abuses and its ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nBush was one of the first members of Congress to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the only Palestinian American member of Congress. Tlaib won her uncontested primary Tuesday after AIPAC's efforts to recruit a challenger failed.\n\nBush was first elected in 2020 when she beat former Rep. William Lacy Clay in the Democratic primary by less than three points. The win marked a seismic shift in St. Louis politics and the end of the Clay dynasty, which represented the area for a half-century.\n\nBowman and Bush's wins that year grew the incipient Squad from four to six, and, with the victories, progressives' hopes for building a base in Congress that could work toward policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and criminal justice reforms.\n\nOriginal reporting.

He beat a three-decade incumbent who failed to indict the police officer who killed Michael Brown in 2014. Some prosecutors working in the office were so enraged by Bell's win that they joined the police union.\n\nIn a phone call last summer , Bell promised Bush he would not run against her. At the time, he was running for the U.S. Senate in Missouri. As AIPAC beefed up its campaign last fall to oust Squad members over ceasefire calls, Bell abandoned the Senate run and entered the House race.\n\nAs the congressional race heated up, Bell's critics in Missouri said he had failed to follow through on promises he made while campaigning for prosecutor. Civil rights groups published a report last month criticizing Bell's office for failing to implement reforms and overseeing a steady rise in the jail population during his time in office. Others noted that while he campaigned on not seeking the death penalty , he let death penalty cases proceed without a challenge.\n\nBell's critics have also complained about comments he made shortly after Brown's killing in 2014 that downplayed the racial divide in Ferguson. Correction: August 7, 2024 A previous version of this article misstated the month of New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman's primary. It was June, not July.\n\nWAIT!

Cori Bush, D-Mo.\n\nAIPAC's super PAC, United Democracy Project, has gone on to spend a total of $7 million so far to oust Bush. Its recent mailers, reviewed by The Intercept, show images of Bush with distorted features that make her forehead look bigger and elongate her features.\n\nBush condemned the ads as part of a trope of using racist caricatures to target candidates based on their ethnicity.\n\n\"It is shameful that, in 2024, our communities are still being targeted with such blatant racism from political campaigns, let alone in a Democratic primary,\" Bush said in a statement to The Intercept. \"The people of St. Louis deserve better than to see their first Black Congresswoman racistly distorted into a caricature - I shouldn't have to ask my opponent to condemn his biggest funders for putting out an ad like this and to apologize to the people of this district.\"\n\nAIPAC, the leading pro-Israel lobbying group, has been one of the single largest outside spenders in an election cycle that's broken records for the most expensive House primaries in history. According to Sludge , AIPAC helped raise two-thirds of the campaign funding for Bush's Democratic opponent, St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell. (Neither United Democracy Project nor Bell's campaign responded to requests for comment.)\n\nThe photo of Bush used in the AIPAC mailers was taken from a Missouri Independent article . In the mailers, part of Bush's forehead has been photoshopped and appears sloped. The photos are also color altered.\n\nThe Missouri Independent said AIPAC's use of the photo violated its site rules .\n\n\"As a nonprofit news organization we do not allow campaigns or political groups to use our photography,\" said Jason Hancock, the editor-in-chief of the Missouri Independent. \"We would never give a PAC permission to use our photos, and doing so without our knowledge or permission violates our terms of use.\"\n\nThe mailers are the latest in a long history of ads that have distorted candidates' skin color and facial features in line with stereotypical racist tropes. Bush's campaign said ads from her 2020 opponent, former Democratic Rep. Willian Lacy Clay, also darkened her skin. In 2022, a Democratic firm working for Bowman's opponent ran ads that darkened Bowman's skin .\n\nRepublican ads run during the 2020 Georgia Senate race darkened Raphael Warnock's skin and enlarged Jon Ossoff's nose .\n\nWith its attacks on Bush, the lobby group is looking to oust a second member of the progressive Squad. The group spent more than $17 million to unseat Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., last month.\n\nSince toppling Bowman last month, AIPAC has shifted its focus toward the upcoming primary in St. Louis. It's dropped $3 million on the race against Bush in less than a month.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAIPAC has long been known for its behind-the-scenes lobbying but expanded its electoral presence and started giving directly to candidates in 2021. The group launched two new political action committees that year, including a regular PAC and its super PAC, United Democracy Project. The new electoral investment has gone largely toward ousting progressive members of Congress.\n\nAIPAC has grown to one of the single largest outside groups spending in primaries this cycle and flooded Democratic primaries with millions of dollars, drawn largely from Republicans , right-wing billionaires, and megadonors .\n\nAIPAC's infusion of cash into Bowman's race made the election the most expensive House Democratic primary in history. And AIPAC isn't just spending on ads - it's paying for phone banking and get-out-the-vote calls as well.\n\nJustice Democrats, a progressive group backing Bush, called on Bell's campaign to denounce the ads.\n\n\"In Wesley Bell's name, AIPAC is peddling racist caricatures to attack Missouri's first Black Congresswoman in a disgusting new low even for them,\" said Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi. \"Bell should immediately condemn these racist pieces of mail and apologize to the people of St. Louis for allowing his biggest financial backers to promote outright racism in this Democratic primary.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "At DNC, the Squad Warns Democrats to Wake Up to the Threat of AIPAC\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"It was Jamaal and I this time,\" said Rep. Cori Bush, who was ousted by AIPAC millions, \"but who is it going to be in two years?\"\n\nWith the Democratic primary season winding down, members of the Squad are speaking more directly than ever about the role that the pro-Israel lobby played in silencing critics of Israel's human rights abuses in Congress, as well as Democrats' complicity.\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention entered its final day in Chicago, the topic of the war on Gaza and the role of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in elections had been largely absent from the main stage. No Palestinian speakers got time on the dais, despite the protest efforts from the \"Uncommitted\" movement this week.\n\nInstead, the conversation among Democrats about pushing for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, an end to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel, and the party's role in allowing AIPAC to shape its primaries has been taking place outside the United Center, where progressives held protests to hold convention delegates' feet to the fire.\n\nAnd victims of AIPAC's political campaigns were on hand to add their voices to the demonstrations.\n\n\"Their role in my primary was egregious,\" Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., who was unseated amid an onslaught of millions of dollars from AIPAC, told The Intercept during an interview at the DNC. \"It was largely deceptive, because they were trying to hide their affiliation as far as the reason they needed to run someone against me. But after my opponent won, they wanted to boast the win.\"\n\nAIPAC spent more than $25 million to unseat Bush and Rep. Jamaal Bowman , D-N.Y., in primaries this cycle. The outside spending from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups made the two races the most expensive Democratic House primaries in history.\n\nAIPAC's attack ads against Bush concealed the group's sole policy priority is Israel, Bush said.\n\n\"Not one ad spoke about Israel. Not one ad spoke about Palestine,\" she said. \"Not one ad spoke about antisemitism.\"\n\nThe pro-Israel campaigning against members of the Squad has largley focused on Black members of Congress. Bush, Bowman, and Reps. Summer Lee, D-Pa., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., had all emerged as targets of pro-Israel spending, though AIPAC itself begged out of the latter races. In Bush's race, AIPAC's super PAC aired an ad that distorted her features by elongating her face - a distortion Bush characterized as racist.\n\n\"They were bigoted, they were racist, and it was allowed,\" Bush said. \"If you're not racist, don't do racist things. They have shown themselves to be racist.\"\n\nShe pushed back against the idea that the group can't carry out racist campaigning because it backed a Black opponent - St. Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell - in her race and a number of other members of the Congressional Black Caucus .\n\n\"To switch out a voice speaking truth to power,\" Bush said, \"for someone who is more palatable is what they're doing.\"\n\n\"The person who ran against me was OK with the lies,\" she went on, referring to Bell. \"He should have run on who he is, what he plans to do, and the difference between us. But instead, he did not do that. What he did was deceive the people of the 1st District of Missouri.\" (Bell did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nDemocrats should be concerned about AIPAC's role in the party's primaries, Bush said.\n\n\"That was just my race,\" she said, \"but what will they do next? Because what they're ultimately trying to do is move Democrats further to the right.\"\n\n\"I want Democrats to realize, it was Jamaal and I this time, but who is it going to be in two years?\"\n\nBush was not the only member of Congress to speak out against AIPAC at the DNC. Lee and Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., gave remarks criticizing the pro-Israel lobby at a Wednesday evening documentary screening about Gaza. Both Lee and Ramirez told The Intercept that it was time for the party to realize the spending by outside groups was a threat to all members, not just progressives.\n\nThe event took place at the historic Grace Episcopal Church, as programming started across town at the United Center and delegates and convention attendees awaited speeches from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, former President Bill Clinton, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nInside the film screening, audience members cried while watching a Fault Lines documentary that recounted the stories of Palestinian families trapped in Gaza . The Rajabs had seven members of their family, including their 6-year-old daughter Hind , killed by Israeli forces after being trapped in a car for hours.\n\n\"Every single Democrat should be concerned that one or two super PACs were able to concentrate $18 million to take out a Democrat.\"\n\nRamirez told the audience that shortly after Bowman's loss, her colleagues in Congress voted for a bill that negated the numbers of civilian deaths coming out of Gaza. Ramirez said one colleague told her they voted for the bill because they didn't want outside groups \"to Jamaal\" them.\n\nAfter the event, Ramirez told The Intercept that the party should be worried about the influence AIPAC is having on its primary elections.\n\n\"Every single Democrat should be concerned that one or two super PACs were able to concentrate $18 million to take out a Democrat, and that so much of that money came from Republicans,\" Ramirez said. \"You put $18 million against Leader Jeffries\" - Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat - \"he's in trouble. Every one of us is in trouble,\" she said. \"What AIPAC did should be criminal.\"\n\nSpeaking out, however, can come with a cost: incurring the wrath of AIPAC and its millions. \"It puts a lot of us in a really tough position,\" Ramirez said. \"It makes me wonder: How much do I have to raise before I even start collecting signatures again? Because they will do everything they possibly can to make us vulnerable.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nOn an evening stroll after the screening, Lee warned of the influence of big money, in general. \"Money in politics, whoever is putting it in, is never your friend,\" she told The Intercept. AIPAC spent $4 million against Lee in 2022 and failed to recruit at least two people to run against her this cycle, The Intercept reported .\n\n\"The same people who are funding AIPAC are the same people who are behind any other corporate interest, any other interest that's against the will of working class people, of marginalized people.\"\n\n\"When we think about why Cori or Jamaal were actually targeted - why me or anyone else, why we're actually targeted - it's not just about foreign policy,\" she said. \"This is less about foreign policy and more about the fact that there is a concerted effort to keep power, to keep influence, to keep democracy out of the hands of communities that have been historically disenfranchised.\"\n\n\"AIPAC isn't coming into this district and supporting a member because they want them to be able to advance the causes of Black people,\" Lee said. AIPAC has targeted Jewish members of Congress in previous cycles, like former Rep. Andy Levin , D-Mich.; the group also targeted former Rep. Marie Newman , D-Ill., whose husband is Jewish. This cycle, AIPAC's main targets have been Black members.\n\n\"They're giving money to a politician who will still do their will, who will still advance their policy. So at the end of the day, yes, if you are keeping Black districts, Black communities from being able to self-determine who they want to represent them, what issues they want at the forefront, then that is racism,\" she said. \"It doesn't matter whether you have a Black friend. Having a Black friend does not make you anti-racist.\"\n\nBlack districts don't have the money to fight AIPAC's war chest, Lee said. \"What AIPAC knows is that the Bronx or the Mon Valley where I'm from, or St. Louis and Ferguson, those communities don't have $20 million sitting in them. They know that, and that's the reason why they come into those districts.\"\n\nThe threat facing Democrats isn't just coming from AIPAC, Lee said. \"It's an arms race,' she said. \"It's AIPAC today, it's whoever else tomorrow. There will always be another super PAC tomorrow, because once you create the blueprint, once you pull out the gun, you can't put it back in the holster.\"\n\nLee said Democrats needed to pick a side. \"If we don't put a stop to this, if we don't lead people in a different direction, we will lose our democracy - not because of Trumpism and MAGA-ism. We'll lose our democracy because none of us were courageous enough to stand up to the influences that are undemocratic.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Wesley Bell's Swan Song: Felonies for Ferguson Protesters\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOne of Bell's last actions before taking Rep. Cori Bush's seat in Congress was to charge protesters arrested on the 10-year anniversary of the police killing of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nSt. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell is slated to enter Congress in January. He will replace Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., after ousting her in a Democratic primary in August with help in the form of $14 million from the leading pro-Israel lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. As one of his final acts in office, Bell is charging at least eight protesters who demonstrated outside the Ferguson Police Department in August on the 10-year anniversary of the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown Jr. with felonies.\n\nBell's office charged the eight protesters with trying to intervene in the arrests of other protesters, causing property damage to a gate outside the police department, and attempting to disarm an officer. One man was charged with assaulting a police officer who fell to the ground after they collided on the sidewalk, and the officer suffered a severe brain injury. The defendant is being held on cash bail for $500,000 . Two of the other defendants are still in custody. The cases are pending in the circuit court of St. Louis County.\n\nA spokesperson for the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said the majority of people at the protest were not charged with a crime and that those who were charged were not targeted because they were protesting. \"In these cases, we didn't charge protesters; protesting is not a crime,\" said public information officer Chris King.\n\n\"Almost all of the people who attended this protest were not charged with a crime because we were presented with no evidence that they had committed a crime,\" King said. \"All defendants are presumed innocent.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe decision by Bell's office to prosecute people arrested at the protests confirmed for some that little change has come to policing in Ferguson in the decade since Brown's killing . Protests in 2014 after Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Brown jettisoned the Black Lives Matter movement to national prominence. In 2018, Bell campaigned for the prosecutor's office as a reformer and criticized his predecessor for failing to indict Brown's killer. Bell's office later declined to prosecute Wilson after reviewing the case. In the lead-up to last month's primary, Bell's critics complained that he had not delivered the reforms he'd campaigned on. In a campaign video for Bush released in July, Brown's family said Bell failed to reform the office and used the family for power.\n\nThe protesters were arrested just days after Bell won the Democratic primary election against Bush in August. Activists in Ferguson said they were frustrated that while they saw few changes to prosecution under Bell, he's now moving on to a higher office after ousting Bush, a Ferguson protest leader, with help from AIPAC's super PAC.\n\n\"Right now the police narrative around this is all we're seeing,\" said Sandra Tamari, a Palestinian organizer based in St. Louis who was active during the Ferguson protests in 2014. She is the executive director of Adalah Justice Project, a nonprofit advocacy organization, but spoke to The Intercept in a personal capacity. \"Obviously we are hoping that the officer fully recovers from his injuries and that Elijah [Gant] sees freedom soon,\" Tamari said.\n\n\"Now the police department and Wesley Bell are trying to crucify a young Black man because of this. This was a really horrible accident that frankly was due to police aggression and police negligence,\" she said. \"They're trying to scapegoat this young activist who, as you know, is now in jail with half a million dollars cash bail only, which is insane.\"\n\nTwo organizers who were present at the protest in August said police descended on people without warning, and then tried to push a narrative after the fact that protesters had turned violent. Both organizers spoke to The Intercept on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from law enforcement.\n\nOne of the organizers said the police response to protests was emblematic of how little has changed in Ferguson over the last decade. \"It was disheartening in the days following to see the mainstream narrative in St. Louis be overwhelmingly pro-cop, and unquestioning of the blatant lies cops directed towards protesters,\" they said.\n\n\"It is clear to many of us that police are not effective as a means of public safety, as cops continue to unnecessarily escalate and turn nonviolent environments into violent ones,\" they said. \"In this case, their escalation has led to harm to their own officer and to an entire community of activists who continue to be terrorized not only by police, but by a prosecutor who protects and upholds their deadly lies.\"\n\nThe other organizer who was at the protests said they saw officers making violent arrests. \"The flashlight on the neck really tightly, people being carried, dragged,\" they said.\n\nThe organizers said that they were initially heartened when Bell ran for office on the platform of bringing change to the criminal legal system and ousting his predecessor, Bob McCulloch, who had failed to indict Wilson in Brown's killing, they said. Now, he's charging protesters and receiving money from AIPAC to take over Bush's seat.\n\nBefore her election in 2020, Bush was a nurse and activist who helped lead protests against Brown's killing in Ferguson and St. Louis. Her role as a protest leader helped propel her campaign against the backdrop of nationwide protests against police brutality in 2020 and led her to topple a two-decade incumbent .\n\nBush became the second Squad member to lose her seat this cycle after being targeted by AIPAC in a Democratic primary.

      "text": "A Year Since Their Ceasefire Resolution, Progressives Say Only an Arms Embargo Can Stop Israel\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHer call for a ceasefire was prescient. Now Rep. Cori Bush says the Biden administration must stop enabling Israel's violence.\n\nOne year since she introduced a resolution for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., said she hasn't seen any indication that a Kamala Harris presidency would result in a different U.S policy toward Israel.\n\n\"I have not seen anything different than, we continue to send the weapons to facilitate the violence,\" Bush told The Intercept. \"As long as we are continuing to send the weapons and the funding to bomb people, to destroy, to exterminate a whole people, then everything else is just talk.\"\n\n\"We can't say that we want the violence to stop, and then we help hand over the weapons that cause the violence.\"\n\nAmid growing public outrage over U.S. support for Israel's war, President Joe Biden has reportedly used tough language with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and in one instance, paused a weapons shipment. Yet there has been no fundamental shift in policy: the U.S. has sent $17.9 billion to Israel over the last year, and even as the administration this week warned Israel that its failure to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza could affect U.S. military aid, a White House spokesperson said the letter was \"not meant as a threat.\"\n\nFor Bush, the White House's admonishments ring hollow so long as the military aid keeps flowing. \"I hear the stern words,\" she said. \"We can't say that we want the violence to stop, and then we help hand over the weapons that cause the violence.\"\n\nBush, along with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was one of the earliest congressional proponents for a ceasefire in Gaza - a position that was seen as a third rail in Washington. During a White House press conference , press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described calls for a ceasefire as \"repugnant,\" \"disgraceful,\" and \"wrong,\" while congressional Democrats piled on Tlaib . Since then, Israel has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza and expanded its war into Lebanon , where it has also killed thousands of people.\n\n\"We had foresight at that time,\" Bush said. \"Had the administration listened then, where would we be now?\"\n\nWith diplomacy all but stalled as the war widens, the calls for a ceasefire have evolved into a stronger policy demand. \"What we need is for the Biden administration to take action to end the violence, not enable it,\" Bush said. \"What we need is the arms embargo.\" Read our complete coverage Israel's War on Gaza\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nA year after the White House publicly disparaged calls for a ceasefire, Harris and Biden have now at least rhetorically adopted that same demand. Harris first called for a ceasefire in March, before Biden did so and before she became the party's presidential nominee. At the August Democratic National Convention, the vice president repeated the call to the sound of raucous applause. And Biden has repeatedly made similar comments. But activists argue that without an arms embargo, the language coming out of the administration feels hollow .\n\n\"For all of their rhetoric of being appalled at the level of violence,\" said Samer Araabi, a member of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, a Bay Area advocacy organization. \"Not a single material action has backed those feelings of concern.\"\n\nAraabi said a ceasefire has always been the goal, but it's now crystal clear that an arms embargo is the best shot to get there. \"The only thing that the U.S. has done to bring Israel to bear has been leveraging military aid,\" said Araabi.\n\nActivist organizations, including Jewish Voice for Peace Action and IMEU Policy Project, are rallying around a new resolution from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would block the latest $20 billion weapons sale to Israel.\n\n\"We are over a year into a genocide and the U.S. has spent over $17.9 billion dollars on the Israeli military and on sending weapons to the Israeli military,\" said Beth Miller, political director at JVP Action. \"The only way that this regional war stops, the only way that this genocide stops is when the U.S. stops sending weapons.\"\n\nIn the month since Israel intensified its assault on Lebanon, at least 1.2 million Lebanese nationals have been displaced by Israel's bombing campaign. And just this week, the United States deployed 100 troops and an air missile defense system to Israel.\n\n\"I don't think we're any closer to a ceasefire than we were a year ago,\" said Sumaya Awad, a Palestinian writer and the director of strategy at Adalah Justice Project. \"In some ways, I think we're even further away because we're now in a place where the U.S. government is entering into a war that could have been stopped with a ceasefire a month ago, two months ago, certainly a year ago. Instead, we just get this hollow rhetoric from our government about the importance of pushing toward a ceasefire and humanitarian aid - while they actively send the arms and the bombs that are going into Gaza and now Lebanon.\"\n\nThe \"forefronting\" of the ask for an arms embargo is an important part of the strategy going forward, argued Awad, who is also a member of New York City Democratic Socialists of America, which is advocating for an immediate ceasefire. \"An arms embargo and ceasefire at this point now go hand in hand,\" she said. \"If you say ceasefire but you're not saying we're going to stop sending you weapons, then you're not actually pushing for a ceasefire, you're just playing with words.\"\n\nWhile more than 90 members of Congress have now called for a ceasefire in Gaza - although with conditions or caveats that rendered many such calls empty - most have not signed onto the only piece of legislation in Congress calling for one.\n\nSince Bush first introduced the resolution with 12 original co-sponsors, six other members have signed on. Another resolution denouncing calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, introduced in March by Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., meanwhile, has 18 co-sponsors.\n\nThe issue has also greatly motivated political donors . The American Israel Public Affairs Committee spent millions to oust Bush and Rep. Jamaal Bowman , who was an original co-sponsor on Bush's ceasefire resolution. AIPAC and its super PAC, United Democracy Project, spent more than $100 million on primaries this cycle, making Bush and Bowman's races two of the most expensive House Democratic primaries in history. The group has targeted members of Congress who have highlighted human rights violations in Israel and called on the U.S. to place conditions on military aid.\n\nBush worries that AIPAC's influence will have a chilling effect on legislators moving forward. \"With the attacks from AIPAC, I don't know what that's gonna look like in the new Congress. I don't know what that's gonna look like when new resolutions are brought forward, after Jamaal and I are gone, as people are thinking about their next elections. I don't know how that changes. I'm just hoping that people make the decision that it has to be people over their campaign coffers, it has to be human lives over our positions.\"\n\nDespite the movement's setbacks in Congress, activists like Araabi argue that something fundamental has shifted among Democrats on the Hill. The broad popular consensus among both parties over Israel has shifted, he said, \"in ways we probably haven't seen in a generation in politics.\"\n\nMiller, of JVP Action, noted that the movement's demands are showing up even in the center of U.S. politics. \"We're seeing for example New York Times op-eds by people like [Nicholas] Kristof that are talking about how Biden has become the arms supplier for the flattening of Gaza,\" she said. \"That is the moment when we as movements need to double down on the demand and organize even harder, because we're finally starting to break through.\"\n\nThe lack of policy change from the Biden administration is not a knock on the movement, Miller said. People speaking out against the war in Gaza have faced repression across college campuses , in workplaces , the courts , and in the media . \"State power is operating with this brute force of repression because they are unable to argue with or undercut the moral clarity of what our movements are saying,\" Miller said. \"It's a sign that what we are saying is catching on.\"\n\nWhen Congress reconvenes in November, the Senate will take up the Sanders resolution to block the $20 billion weapons sale proposed in August. Bush said a vote on the legislation is an important next step for Congress. \"I do think that that is a critical move when we're looking at what all we can do to end this cycle of violence,\" Bush said, \"and sending this clear message that the U.S. can't continue to fund military action.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush Boosts Biden's Efforts to Fight Climate Change With Executive Authority\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBush's push would give the White House $100 million in clean energy funding to use through the Defense Production Act.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's efforts to tackle the climate crisis through executive action got an assist this week, courtesy of Missouri Rep. Cori Bush and Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee. One hundred million dollars in new funding, announced Tuesday alongside other measures in the upcoming Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies annual appropriations bill, would give the president resources to accelerate the production of solar panels, transformers, and other green technologies.\n\nIn the face of a stalled legislative agenda, Biden has turned to the Defense Production Act, invoking it twice this year to boost the production of green energy technology - once in April and again earlier this month. The DPA enables the president to make large adjustments to U.S. manufacturing policy - an authority that House progressives have been calling for Biden to use more aggressively. Senators of both parties, including Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have also called on Biden to use the DPA to support green technology manufacturing - making passage into law, once the appropriations bill passes the House and is amended in the Senate, more likely.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe new funding would strengthen the effectiveness of Biden's action and bolster precedent for using executive authority to fight the climate crisis. The text of the provision gives Biden wide latitude in deciding how exactly to use the funds in support of those technologies, as is standard for policy created through the DPA.\n\nThe measure's inclusion was the result of a last-minute, behind-the-scenes effort by Bush, whose office has regularly led efforts for bold climate legislation. In a statement provided to The Intercept, Bush praised the inclusion of the funding. \"The DPA is one of the most important tools we have to take on high gas prices and the climate crisis at the same time,\" she said. \"To protect all of our communities, particularly those with the greatest need, we must take robust measures to transition to renewable energy and lower prices as quickly as possible. This funding helps us achieve that.\"\n\nProgressives in Congress have called on Biden to use his broad executive authority to make headway on a suite of Democratic priorities. In March, the Congressional Progressive Caucus pushed Biden to invoke the DPA as part of an aggressive administrative response to the climate crisis. Bush also introduced similar legislation with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., to bolster the Defense Production Act earlier this year.\n\nBut while House leadership and the White House have been broadly supportive of the provision, Biden's latest invocation of the DPA left members of the House Appropriations Committee with little time to account for the new policy in ongoing negotiations. After individual Appropriations subcommittees receive their top-line figures, which in this case roughly coincided with Biden's announcement at the beginning of June, it is difficult to secure funding for new priorities. By coordinating discussions among the White House, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Bush - a first-term representative - exerted a rare amount of influence over a process that is usually guided by senior members of the caucus.\n\nIn a press release marking the subcommittee's release of the draft bill, Kaptur touted the inclusion of the DPA funding, indicating that Bush's efforts have significant buy-in from key players in the appropriations process. \"From unleashing energy innovation and utilizing the Defense Production Act to boost domestic manufacturing, to responsibly managing water resources and tackling the crisis of climate change - this Energy and Water bill delivers for America's needs in the 21st century,\" Kaptur said.\n\nIf the new funding survives ongoing negotiations, it may embolden progressives to demand more executive action from the administration. Legislation that endorses Biden's use of the DPA to support green energy technology would provide the administration with a layer of insulation from legal challenges over the issue going forward. If Democrats lose one or both chambers of Congress in November, that precedent could be key to ensuring that the administration has tools to continue fighting the climate crisis.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush on Republicans Who Fueled Attack on Capitol: \"That Blood Is on All of Their Hands\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBush spoke to The Intercept about her resolution to investigate members of Congress who sought to overturn the election results.\n\nRep. Cori Bush's first resolution in Congress calls to investigate and potentially expel Republican members who upheld Donald Trump's lies disputing the results of the presidential election, inciting a mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday that left five people dead.\n\nThe freshman member from St. Louis - who was a leader of the 2014 protests for Black lives in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police killing of Michael Brown - announced the resolution on Twitter on Wednesday evening, hours after hundreds of Trump supporters breached security at the Capitol and before the building had been secured.\n\nRelated Donald Trump Unleashed His Cult on American Democracy\n\nThe resolution, the full text of which was shared exclusively with The Intercept, calls on the House Ethics Committee to investigate and issue a report on whether Republican members violated their oath of office by seeking to overturn the results of the election, and whether they should face sanction - including removal from the House. The measure names Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala. , as well as Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as leading the more than 140 members who \"have taken unprecedented steps to defy the will of the American people\" by voting against Wednesday's Electoral College certification. Bush plans to introduce the resolution Monday if Congress decides to reconvene instead of continuing their planned recess.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Bush told The Intercept that she had been contemplating the resolution even before her official swearing-in last Sunday. \"We need to hold our Republican colleagues accountable for what we feel is an attack on our democracy,\" she said.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt's not unheard of for members of either party to object to certifying the results of a presidential election. Some Democrats have objected to certifying the results of several presidential elections over the last two decades, including in 2017 . But the Republican Party's near-total adherence to the lies and incitements to riot precipitating Wednesday's events was unprecedented in every way, from the monthslong building of a conspiracy to weeks of reporting that armed Trump supporters would physically try to stop the certification. More than 140 Republican lawmakers said they would object to certifying the results of the presidential election, with several withdrawing their objections after Wednesday's attacks. Ultimately, eight senators and 139 members of the House supported one or more objections.\n\nBush's resolution places Wednesday's attacks in the context of historic attempts by the GOP to disenfranchise Black and brown voters - particularly in states where they were instrumental in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. It also lays out how the ongoing coronavirus pandemic hit those communities hardest, complicating mail-in voting while Republicans spread misinformation and tried to discount ballots. The measure describes GOP efforts to reject the vote as \"a continuation of Jim Crow era measures to suppress Black, Brown, and Indigenous voters.\"\n\n\"Whereas efforts by Members of Congress, regardless of party, that seek to undermine our democracy, disenfranchise Black, Brown, and Indigenous voters, erode faith in the Federal Government, and attack the popular will of the American public without merit must be condemned, and those Members should be held accountable for their actions,\" the resolution reads.\n\nBush's fellow progressive Squad members - Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Jamaal Bowman, and Mondaire Jones - are among the measure's 32 current backers. The resolution's other co-sponsors include Reps. Barbara Lee, Marie Newman, Mark Pocan, Bill Pascrell, and Bobby Rush. Justice Democrats, the group that supported several Squad members in their runs for Congress, backed the measure, as did Brand New Congress, Ady Barkan's Be A Hero, Mijente, and the Center for Popular Democracy.\n\nBush's resolution comes amid calls for Trump's removal from office, either through the 25th Amendment - an unlikely scenario that would require leadership from Vice President Mike Pence - or impeachment by the House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have called on Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, and on Friday, Pelosi said if Trump \"does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action.\"\n\nShortly after Bush announced the resolution Wednesday, some on the left raised concerns that it could be turned around to expel Democratic members in the future. On Twitter, HuffPost reporter Daniel Marans quoted an anonymous senior figure at a progressive organization as saying, \"It's incredibly dangerous for the left to start advocating for legislators to be expelled based on how they cast their votes on a matter that is duly before them.\"\n\nBush responded to those concerns and spoke about how the resolution came to be in a conversation with The Intercept. The transcript below has been slightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhat does it mean for you, being who you are and coming from where you come from, to have this happen in your first week in office?\n\nIt's what I've been, I feel, being prepared for all of this time. I just didn't know it. But from the perspective of the protesters, to be here, and I understand that when I'm at home that I have security challenges because of who I am - but I was told that when I was here on Capitol grounds, I was safe. I was told that I didn't need extra security. And that's not what happened the other day. And then also, just looking at it from the side of the protester, I saw things happening that I know that I myself could not have gotten away with and have been brutalized for less. So it was very difficult. Then now I have to work here, and so does my staff. And I want all of us to feel safe.\n\nWhere were you when the Capitol was breached on Wednesday?\n\nI was on my way back to my office, or I had just stepped in my office, one of the two. Probably on the way to the office by the time the footage came out. I was in the Capitol at first; I was in the House gallery actually listening to debate. And I just decided that it was time to get up. You know, I just felt like, \"Get up, and go check and see what's happening outside.\" And so I did. Went to the second floor to see what was happening outside, and I was seeing Trump flags coming. At first I couldn't see the full flag, and then I started to see the full flag, so that meant that people were approaching. So my chief and I, we immediately got on an elevator and left and made it back safely to our office.\n\nWhat was going through your head when all of this was happening?\n\nI still was just thinking that, you know, it's protest. That they're going to just be out here for a long time, in the cold, and they want to make their voices heard, they want to be on camera, they want to not take what they feel is an injustice toward them lying down. So OK, I get it. But when I started to see them coming through the doors - I made it back to my office and I looked up at the television and we started to see people coming through those doors. Then my thoughts were, OK, if they made it through those doors, they can make it through ours.\n\nCan you tell me when and how the idea for your resolution came about? Is it something you were thinking about before entering Congress?\n\nPersonally, I started thinking about it before we were sworn in. We were thinking about just making sure that something - that there was some type of consequence. And so we kind of played around with what we thought that that should be for a few days. And then once we were sworn in, we pretty much had the idea, like this is what we need. We need to hold our Republican colleagues accountable for what we feel is an attack on our democracy.\n\nWhat has the response been from other members of Congress?\n\n\"We need to hold our Republican colleagues accountable for what we feel is an attack on our democracy.\"\n\nWe have had great response, from not only freshmen Congress members but also senior Congress members. We have people who are part of the Progressive Caucus , people who are a part of the Hispanic Caucus. And people signed on fairly quickly. To be a freshman and to be on my third day that day, and to see other Congress members who felt the same way and were willing to publicly say that, that blew me away. And I felt like, OK, we are on the right track. Like this - we are on the right track. And not only me, but so many others that are working on whether it's articles of impeachment or just other resolutions, it's needed right now. And we can't wait. We have to do it right now, in this moment.\n\nYou include the context of Covid-19, voter disenfranchisement, and the impact this has on Black, brown, and Indigenous communities. This is not language we are used to seeing in congressional bills. Why was that important for you to include here?\n\nBecause I'm not like other Congress people. I am someone who is straight from the movement, the movement to save Black lives. I'm from the Ferguson uprising. And so I'm not the typical Congress member. But I feel like that is why I'm here. Because we have legislation that talks around us. We have legislation that affects people who are outside - they're just not as connected to people like me. We don't reach far enough to be able to help people. And so we wanted to make sure that this legislation is reflective of who we are, my experiences. When I think about what our core values are in this office, our work is to do the absolute most for every person in our district, starting with those who have the very least. This is how you do it.\n\nAfter you announced the resolution, some raised concerns about free speech, including that the resolution could be turned around on Democrats in the future as a way to penalize them for making unpopular votes. What do you say to that criticism?\n\nI say that right now we need to move, and we need to move quick. I say that the fact that we have support from other Congress members who are more seasoned than I am, that understand the ramifications of this, I feel like that is why we need to move forward. And I do, I understand that we want to make sure that we don't put ourselves in a position to where this can then be turned on us later. But if we don't do something right now - because before Donald Trump was even inaugurated in 2016, I wanted him out. You know? So before he even took the seat, I was ready for him to go. Had I been in Congress then, I would've been calling for his impeachment immediately. So I wouldn't have been one of the ones that had to go back and forth, and sit on the sidelines, and we're gonna wait, and all the waiting happened, and then it finally happened. And so I believe the same thing here. Donald Trump has only a few days left in his seat. And when we talk about those Republican members of Congress, their work is happening right now. So we have to do that right now.\n\nWhy can't we make sure - because we also can't set the precedent that if you do this, we're gonna worry about what happens in four years or eight years. Your work was right now. The work that you did to try to steal an election, that election was now. The people who were hurt a couple of days ago, those who lost their lives, they lost their lives in the now. So you deserve the consequences now. That is why we are calling for this investigation into the Republican efforts to overturn this election. People died. And [Republicans] put the lives of all the lawmakers that were here, our staff, they put us in danger. And they put us in danger to save face.\n\nSo when I think about protest, as someone who's been in hundreds of protests over the last few years, we were protesting to save lives. They did this the other day protesting to save face , and those Republicans helped to embolden - those Republican Congress members helped to empower them to be able to do it. So much so that one Congress member even talked about how their constituents were outside. Now true enough, any of us could have had constituents outside. I get that. But to stand on the House floor and to say that, and to say, \"Those are the people that I represent. They need to have their voices heard.\" Are voices being heard in us storming the U.S. Capitol, breaking windows, taking over offices, putting lives in danger, and being what caused four people to actually lose their - no, five now - to lose their lives? That blood is on all of their hands. And that's why we're also asking for leadership, we're calling on leadership and my fellow colleagues to join us in calling for the initiation for this formal process to remove members. We want them removed.\n\nI want to ask you about what you just said about the constituents. Because these members say they have a duty to do something about their constituents' mistrust in the electoral process. What is your response to that defense?\n\n[Laughs] There is probably no other group with their feet on the ground in the United States that has more of a mistrust to this process than the Black community. Because of all that we've gone through through the years since we were stolen and brought to this country. At least those of us, our ancestors that were. So to then feel like you have been disenfranchised because your favorite TV character, President Donald Trump, did not win - even though he lost the popular vote by more than 7 million votes, even though he has tried over and over again to force this through even in the courts, and he has not been successful, and even though the 14th Amendment stands on our side, they continue to feel like this is what they should be doing. And I push back, because you didn't stand with the Black community. In '65? Where was all of this in '65, in '64, in '63, in '62? Where was this? Where was this when, ever since the Voting Rights Act - especially since 2013, the way that the Republicans in all of these various states have been working to gut the Voting Rights Act of '65 - where this uprising then?\n\nThe issue is, when it comes to Black and Brown and Indigenous peoples, when it comes to our vote, it's OK to invalidate our votes. Because it is always OK to them to silence us. Now when it's turned around, and they feel like they're the ones being targeted, or they feel like it's some type of injustice against them, now the same things that they criticized us for - protests, being off work, covering our faces at a protest, trying to come into a building - all of those things, now it's OK for them to do. And, to take it a step further, fight police officers. The same police officers who they said we should be obeying, and our issue is we don't know how to listen or obey. The same police officers that I cannot take my - I cannot take my hand, pick up a finger, and touch a police officer with that one finger. But yet and still, they can fight the police on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar has drafted articles of impeachment, so have Reps. Lieu, Raskin and Cicilline, but with Congress being adjourned, they've been unable to introduce them. There's been some debate within the caucus over reconvening to take action over Wednesday's events - and your resolution would be a part of that. What have you and your colleagues discussed on the issue of impeachment? What do you expect to hear from Speaker Pelosi on this today?\n\nI want to move forward with it. I totally support what my colleagues are working on right now. If we have to stay to get this done, I am all for it. What I've been hearing is, I have colleagues who are saying like, \"We need to do this right now.\" They're like, \"We need to do this today. We need to get this done. Like let's get to work.\" And that's been probably what I've heard the most: that people not only want it, but they want it now. I'm expecting to hear from the speaker that that is where we're going. I know that because the 25th Amendment may not be able to be possible, so this I believe is our road.\n\nWe have to do something. We cannot allow Donald Trump to leave office after this egregious act happened, and for that to not go down in the history books that we, as lawmakers, that we didn't stand against this. Because our people need that - not only us, our people need that. And history needs to show that there was a consequence to his actions. Not only just the blood on his hands.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Down Goes Clay: Cori Bush Knocks Off Half-Century Dynasty\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nCori Bush's triumph over 19-year incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in St. Louis, Missouri, is Justice Democrats' latest upset.\n\nIn an upset that will rock the House Democratic Caucus, Ferguson activist Cori Bush on Tuesday unseated Rep. Lacy Clay, whose family has represented the St. Louis-area congressional district for more than 50 years.\n\nClay dominated Bush among mail-in and absentee ballots, leading some outlets to prematurely call the race, but Bush surged back with a commanding Election Day lead, narrowly topping Clay by 3 points when all were counted.\n\nBush was among the original Justice Democrat recruits in 2018, but lost her first challenge by 20 points. A registered nurse and pastor, she made a second run this cycle, again with the backing of Justice Democrats, the progressive group best known for recruiting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"It is historic that this year, of all the years, we are sending a Black, working-class single mother who's been fighting for Black lives since Ferguson all the way to the halls of Congress,\" Bush said in a victory speech.\n\nBush's win follows the upset of veteran Rep. Eliot Engel at the hands of Jamaal Bowman in New York, and longtime Rep. Daniel Lipinski in Illinois, who fell to Marie Newman. Justice Democrats also supported a challenge against Rep. Henry Cuellar, who narrowly fended off Jessica Cisneros in Texas.\n\nNot me, US.\n\n- Cori Bush (@CoriBush) August 5, 2020\n\nBush's win is monumental in a number of ways. Unlike Bowman, she did not have the luxury of an opponent who fled his district and told a hot mic that he only wanted to speak at a Black Lives Matter rally because he had a primary to worry about. When Engel lost to Bowman, an anonymous Democrat argued to the New York Post that his loss was a fluke and tied to his race and his lack of energy in office. \"It doesn't show AOC's power - it shows that New York voters want demographic changes in the House,\" the Democrat was quoted saying. \"They don't want old white guys who don't do anything. Not only old white guys; but old white guys who only work when they're up for reelection. ... People are punishing these kinds of lawmakers. If you're old, white, and lazy, you're going to get kicked out.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nClay, however, is not old (he just turned 64, a decade younger than Engel), white, or lazy. Clay did not remotely take Bush for granted, launching a full-scale negative campaign to try to take her down, and has been focused on her as a threat since her loss to him in 2018. He is a fixture of the community, and he and his father, Bill Clay Sr., a civil rights activist and co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, have continuously held the seat since the 1960s. His father lamented the loss on Wednesday.\n\nSCOOP: I've obtained the first comment from the Clay family since the longtime dynasty was defeated last night.\n\n\"The Clays' years of elected public service...has ended,\" says frmr Rep. Bill Clay (father of Lacy), blaming \"outside money from sources associated w/ Bernie Sanders\" pic.twitter.com/43Rvwr1fcb\n\n- Gabe Fleisher (@WakeUp2Politics) August 5, 2020\n\nClay's defeat is also ominous for incumbent Democrats, as he was hammered at home by an outside anti-monopoly group for his work with the financial industry to undo an Obama-era piece of Wall Street reform. The group, Fight Corporate Monopolies, spent $90,000 airing the attack ad, causing pain for Clay on the type of issue that rarely leaves the Beltway. It was doubly ominous given that it came from nowhere, and the new group, which had only previously spent against Massachusetts Rep. Richie Neal , does not disclose its donors.\n\nBush rose to prominence as a leader of the Ferguson protests in August 2014 and, with the help of Justice Democrats, challenged Clay in 2018 . That year, Bush told The Intercept that she was optimistic about the growing momentum progressives were having in Congress. \"I don't think it was just lightning striking in that moment, like I heard some people say, I think this is a movement and I think it's only going to grow,\" Bush said. \"From 2018 to 2020, I think this is going to continue to push forward because people are beginning to see now that this can happen.\"\n\nJustice Democrats was born out of the group Brand New Congress, which had initially launched with the plan to oust all 435 members of Congress, but that ambitious objective looked to be going zero for 435 heading into the spring. So Justice Democrats, after it split from BNC, chose one race to go all-in on - Ocasio-Cortez's - and followed that with a win by Ayanna Pressley in Boston. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib later also won open seats, creating what is known today as \"the Squad.\" In 2018, Bush was featured alongside Ocasio-Cortez and two other candidates in \"Knock Down the House,\" a Netflix documentary about working-class challengers running for Congress.\n\nOcasio-Cortez traveled to St. Louis to rally for Bush two years ago, but her cash-strapped campaign wasn't able to get the word out to voters, managing just about two weeks of paid radio ads. In 2020, significantly thanks to the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders and his help with fundraising, but also the result of her higher name recognition from her role in the documentary, she was able to mount a more serious campaign and even outspent Clay down the stretch. Through his email list, Sanders raised Bush $107,000 throughout the campaign, a Sanders source said. The local Our Revolution chapter, which was built out of the 2016 Sanders campaign for president, backed Bush in 2018 and again this cycle, making some 30,000 voter contacts for her in 2020.\n\n. @CoriBush started out her victory speech with shoutouts to: @JusticeDems , @BrandNew535, @sunrisemvmt , @DemSocialists , @BernieSanders , and many others.\n\nAlso, I love her dad! pic.twitter.com/73afhkLd1l\n\n- Waleed Shahid ? (@_waleedshahid) August 6, 2020\n\nJustice Democrats spent roughly $200,000 in support of Bush through both a coordinated effort and an independent expenditure. \"Cori is the fifth challenger backed by Justice Democrats to unseat an incumbent,\" said Alexandra Rojas, JD's executive director. \"She organized a movement through pepper spray and rioting police in the streets of Ferguson. Her tenacity and unbreakable pursuit of justice is desperately needed in Congress today.\"\n\nSunrise Movement, the youth climate group, was active on her behalf as well, as was Matriarch , a new organization that backs working-class women running for office. \"She ran on defund the police, the Green New Deal, and Medicare for All and defeated a multigenerational political dynasty who got too close to corporate donors and too far from the needs of his district,\" said Evan Weber, political director of Sunrise.\n\nYet Ocasio-Cortez declined to endorse Bush in her second run, as did many of the progressive groups that make up the institutional left. Clay has played a leading role in casting Justice Democrats as flatly racist in its willingness to challenge members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Ocasio-Cortez, as an incumbent, has been under intense pressure not to get behind primary challengers to her colleagues, and only backed Bowman after Engel's hot-mic moment. No sitting member of the House backed Bush.\n\nBowman, however, rallied for her.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Cori Bush Demands FBI Data on Her Protest Activity\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAt a House hearing on Thursday, Bush confronted FBI Director Christopher Wray over the bureau's ongoing surveillance of protesters for racial justice.\n\nAt a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., asked FBI Director Christopher Wray for information the bureau had collected on her work as an organizer and activist before her time in Congress. In 2014 and 2017, Bush protested in Ferguson, Missouri, and St. Louis - after police killed 18-year-old Michael Brown and after a judge found the officer who killed 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith not guilty, respectively - and the FBI is known to have collected data on several of the demonstrations in which she participated.\n\nOn June 4, Bush sent a letter to Wray requesting that the bureau deliver access to all information it had collected on her protest and organizing activities before Wray's scheduled testimony on Thursday. Her office said the inspector general for the Department of Justice responded Thursday to a different letter she sent in February, asking about the disparate treatment of protesters last summer and the people who participated in the January 6 attacks on the Capitol. According to Bush's office, the inspector general's review is pending.\n\n\"Public reporting leaves little doubt that the FBI did, in fact, investigate and surveil those who were protesting for racial justice against police brutality,\" Bush wrote. \"I was one such protester.\" She had not received a response by Thursday morning.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"When can I expect to hear back from the bureau regarding that information?\" Bush asked Wray at Thursday's hearing, referring to the data the FBI had compiled on her protest activity. Wray replied that he had only recently learned about the letter, that the bureau receives thousands of requests for files, and that he would have his staff follow up to help her understand how the process works. Bush went on to ask him whether the bureau had deputized federal agents and law enforcement agents in response to civil unrest last summer; if the FBI was authorized to use force in response to the Capitol attacks; and why Wray had stated, earlier in the hearing, that the FBI doesn't surveil First Amendment protests when there is ample evidence to the contrary.\n\nFederal authorities have long surveilled and infiltrated activist movements in the United States, with a particular focus on Black social justice and civil rights organizers, including Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King Jr., the Black Panthers, and Black Lives Matter . As The Intercept reported in 2015, the Department of Homeland Security has routinely monitored activists since the 2014 uprising in Ferguson. The FBI's counterterrorism division identified a fictional \"black identity extremism\" movement as a threat until as recently as 2017, and it warned that \"perceptions of police brutality against African Americans\" drove \"an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will likely serve as justification for such violence.\"\n\nThe practice continued last summer, when the FBI flew an advanced spy plane over Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, D.C. - the same vehicle they used to surveil protests in Baltimore after police killed Freddie Gray in 2015. Meanwhile, the agency says it does not monitor \"First Amendment-protected activities\" without a tip or open investigation; the bureau cited that as a reason it did not catch social media activity related to planning the January 6 attacks on the Capitol.\n\n\"For so long we've been criminalized and intimidated,\" Bush said. \"And I've watched this. And I'm one of those people. I have a unique position now to be able to ask those hard and key questions that nobody else can ask the director the same way that I can - coming directly from the movement and still being very much a part of that same movement.\" Bush said she was targeted as an activist \"quite a bit\" and believes that she was under surveillance, adding that \"the FBI has this history of surveilling Black activists and protesters and civil rights leaders.\"\n\nChristopher Wray, director of the FBI, pauses during a House Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2021.\n\nTo further suppress protests for racial justice, federal and local governments have also resorted to stacking criminal charges against activists to increase their penalties and passing new laws to criminalize specific kinds of demonstrations. Earlier this year, dozens of states introduced anti-protest laws designed to crack down on protests against police brutality, and some states rebranded \"anti-terror\" bills to apply to activities associated with protests for Black lives. In April, Florida adopted some of the most chilling anti-protest legislation in the country: a new law granting civil immunity to a person who drives their car through a crowd of protesters. As The Intercept reported last month, much of the push behind such legislation was driven by law enforcement groups.\n\nHundreds of people who participated in protests last summer were charged with high-level felonies, including charges of terrorism for several teenagers . In October, federal agents arrested Anthony Smith , an influential activist in West Philadelphia known for helping topple a statue of former mayor and Philadelphia Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo, claiming that he had \"aided and abetted\" in the arson of a police car in May. In July, Smith had been a lead plaintiff in a civil rights suit against the city after police shot rubber-tipped bullets at protesters and tear-gassed hundreds of demonstrators marching through an enclosed tunnel . Smith was released from pretrial detention after local activists organized a petition and sent more than 70 letters of support to the judge in Smith's case. His trial is pending.\n\n\"I remain concerned that many law enforcement agencies continue to characterize Black protestors as a threat to public safety rather than as citizens who are more than justified in exercising their First Amendment right to organize and voice their grievances,\" Bush wrote, pointing to the bureau's past use of the term \"black identity extremism.\" She added that she would introduce legislation to \"correct the Bureau's excesses, if necessary.\"\n\nBush said she couldn't yet discuss specifics of the legislation, but her office is working on a protester's bill of rights, similar to local proposals in Missouri. \"We know that we want to protect our protesters and curb any intimidation tactics,\" Bush said, noting that states across the country, including Missouri, introduced or passed anti-protest legislation this year.\n\n\"Rather than using last year as an opportunity for the racial reckoning that it should have been, lawmakers we saw all across this country proposed, and then they passed, all of these dozens of punitive measures to prevent protest instead of actually dealing with what was the real issue,\" Bush said. \"Where is the police accountability? We're not protesting because we don't have anything else to do. We're protesting because we're trying to save Black life. So where are those measures?\" Bush said she and Missouri state Rep. Rasheen Aldridge, who also came out of the activist movement in Ferguson, spoke out against similar proposals in Missouri, and the bills died in session.\n\nFollowing the January attacks on the Capitol, Bush introduced a resolution calling on the House Ethics Committee to investigate whether members of Congress violated their oath of office in seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. \"It's not going away, but we're not at the point where we're able to move that the way I would like to see it move,\" Bush said. Given that the Senate couldn't pass a bipartisan commission to investigate the attacks, she said, the resolution is more important than ever, but its chances of moving are bleak. \"We won't let it go. But we saw how hard it is to even get the commission passed.\"\n\nWhen people call the movement fighting for Black lives a \"terrorist organization,\" Bush said, \"it couldn't be further from the truth. When the truth is that white supremacist groups have been behind over 60 percent of the attacks last year. The real threat that we need to take seriously, they don't want to touch.\" On top of that, she said, \"We have to be very clear that the bureau has a white supremacy problem in their ranks.\" The FBI has long been aware of the issue of white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement, The Intercept has reported .\n\nAt the hearing on Thursday, House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., asked Wray if the bureau was conducting an internal review \"to root out white supremacy and other extremist ideology\" or if it would commit to doing so. Wray said the bureau takes the \"insider threat\" very seriously and would provide Nadler with more information on existing procedures and related internal review processes.\n\nBush told The Intercept that she didn't know before coming to Congress that she could request this kind of information, and many activists still don't realize that they can do so. She added that she wants people to know that they can call her office if they need help with a public records request.\n\n\"You gotta push back against what seems like this system of intimidation and suppression,\" Bush said. \"The more we do this, they will have to do something.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nCori Bush, the Ferguson activist and nurse running for Congress in St Louis, caused a political earthquake this week, unseating a powerful centrist incumbent. Yesterday, she sat down with Jacobin to talk about how she took on the political establishment's big money and won.\n\n(Cori Bush for Congress)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis Tuesday, Cori Bush unseated St Louis congressional incumbent Lacy Clay, who has represented the district for two decades and whose father Bill Clay represented it for three decades before him. Bush is a nurse who was a dedicated activist during the Ferguson uprising in 2014. She's also an outspoken progressive whose campaign was endorsed by Bernie Sanders. In a nod to both those political lineages, she declared victory by sharing a photograph of herself with her fist raised captioned, \"Not me, us.\"\n\nCori Bush's first campaign against Clay was featured in the documentary film Knock Down The House, alongside three other 2018 progressive congressional insurgencies including that of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She lost, but didn't call it quits. Her second campaign against Clay was more robust than the first, and backed by organizations like the Sunrise Movement, Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), of which Bush is a member. Jacobin 's Meagan Day caught up with Bush briefly in the wake of her victory.\n\nHow would you characterize the status quo politics of the Clays, and what have they meant for the people of your district?\n\nFor so long, I have felt so underrepresented or just not represented at all. The status quo was a politics that said that if you are somebody, if you are connected, if you are a big donor, if you're a big corporation, then you have a seat, and everyone else is not as important. If you ask people in the community about Congressman Clay, the first thing many of them are going to say is that he's absent. He was absent when St Louis was going through high crime, high homicides, high poverty, the Ferguson uprising, and everything since. We needed a leader.\n\nWho endorsed your opponent, and who endorsed you?\n\nVery early, our local Sunrise Movement chapter in St Louis got behind me, as did our own St Louis DSA. And then there was Brand New Congress, Justice Democrats, the national organizations of Sunrise and DSA, Matriarch, Our Revolution. We had a few progressive PACs that ended up pushing us, especially closer to the end, like Our Everyday, Future Generations, 350 Action, National Women's Political Caucus.\n\nCongressman Clay was endorsed by the editorial boards of our local papers, the St Louis Post-Dispatch and the St Louis American . He was endorsed by many of the ward organizations, some of which even said, \"Well, you just don't go against the Clays. Even though we may like you, you just don't go against them publicly.\"\n\nYou were also endorsed by Bernie Sanders. And when you won, you posted a photo of yourself with your fist raised in the air captioned, \"Not me, us.\" Do you view your campaign's victory as a step forward for the broader Bernie movement, or whatever comes next in the wake of his presidential campaigns?\n\nTo me this goes back to the Ferguson uprising. St Louis has always been such a divided, segregated city, and during Ferguson we saw people from all walks of life come together to fight for black lives, something I had never seen before. Since then, the silos have been broken down, and we've been able to continue to build since then with so many groups working together. We're uniting for justice for all, and that's what the broader Bernie movement means. Sometimes people want to pigeonhole the Bernie movement into not including people of color or the black community. But I'm standing there with my fist up saying that this movement means justice for everyone.\n\nWhat was the money like in your race?\n\nOur last campaign, we closed out just under $180,000. This campaign, I believe we're over $800,000, and it's still mostly small-dollar donations from regular people. Congressman Clay, last I saw, was at about 74 percent of his donations from corporate PACs and lobbyists. For us, it was small-dollar donations and some dollars from like Our Revolution and Sunrise, and that was basically it. There was no dark money coming in.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the development of your political consciousness, and how Black Lives Matter and the Ferguson uprising in 2014 fit into that?\n\nI grew up in a household where my father always taught us about black history. I couldn't have pictures of Strawberry Shortcake or Cabbage Patch Kids or Barbie going up on my wall, instead it was the great kings and queens of Africa. When the Ferguson movement happened, I was already working with our unhoused population, I was already working against human trafficking, and I was already a nurse and a pastor.\n\nSo when I hit the ground during the uprising, it was just an extension of that work. But this time it was directly about saving black lives from excessive force and police murder. I fought that fight for over four hundred days. In the first three months, I may have missed two days out of the first ninety days. I was incredibly dedicated to that movement, and still am.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that Bernie Sanders's economic equality framing is sometimes portrayed as excluding people of color. Your campaign pushed against that false separation. In your view, what are the overlaps between a politics of racial justice and a politics of economic justice?\n\nA few years ago, if someone was just talking to me about big corporations and climate change and all of that, I would not have paid attention, because at that point I was just trying to keep my son alive. So now when I go to talk to people in the community about those things, I make those connections directly. I make sure people know that the reason why our community has a high incidence of childhood asthma is because of the pollution in our air from from these big coal companies. I need them to understand that what big corporations are doing is directly and disproportionately affecting our black community here.\n\nSo the separation is false, but it's all in how we deliver it. Like take, for example, Medicare for All. I don't just come straight out the gate saying Medicare for All is what you need. I go into our community and say, \"You should not have your health care tied to your job status .\" Or, \"You deserve to have a dentist .\" And then I let them know that's that's what Medicare for All will do for you. If I start with Medicare for All, you're shutting me out. So I'm gonna speak to your needs directly first, and then help you to see how the policy connects to it.\n\nWhen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bernie Sanders for president last year, she said that one of the reasons why she decided to do it is that spending a year in Congress having her arm twisted gave her a newfound respect for Bernie's ability to withstand that pressure for so many decades. Do you have any strategies for resisting the kind of pressures that are going to come to bear on you in Congress?\n\nPeople tried to twist our arm during Ferguson. People tried to buy us, and there were times when we didn't understand that that's what people were doing. People would offer to give a million dollars if you will go do this and that, and we didn't understand it at first, but we learned. Throughout all of that, I stood by my morals and my values, and kept my focus on the changes I needed to see in my community.\n\nWhat's going to fuel me is not wanting to see anyone else go through what I went through. I still remember what my face felt like when it hit the ground when I was being assaulted by the police in Ferguson. I still remember what it was like sleeping in that car with my two children when it was cold outside. I remember these things. And so they can't buy me. They can't pressure me into doing something that won't benefit my community, because I still feel the pain.\n\nCori Bush is a registered nurse, pastor, activist, and Missouri Democratic congressional candidate.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWe all are grieving at the profound loss of life that has occurred over the past ten days. At least 2,700 Palestinians, 1,400 Israelis, and many Americans have been killed. Tens of thousands of people have been injured. [Editor's note: Bush delivered this speech on October 16; the current figures are at least 7,400 Palestinians killed, including 3,000 children, and more than 20,000 injured.] Nearly two hundred Israelis are being held hostage. Families have been destroyed, and Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Muslims, are facing unimaginable trauma as they navigate this horrific moment.\n\nAdding to the crisis, the Israeli government has cut off electricity, food, fuel, and internet to Gaza. It has bombed neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure. It has ordered 1.1 million people - including those who are children, elderly, sick, injured, disabled, and pregnant - to leave their homes in northern Gaza, and then bombed them as they evacuated.\n\nLet me be clear: the collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza is a war crime. With a full-scale invasion of Gaza likely imminent, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives hang in the balance - and it's not only happening right before our eyes, it's happening with the support and power of the United States government. It's shameful. In addition to sharing my grief and sorrow, I want to affirm my strong belief that all human life is equally precious. A belief that above all else we must save lives; we must lead with love and solidarity; we must fight against violence and human suffering.\n\nAs a pastor, I'm reminded in this moment of Matthew 5:9, which says: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\" This Biblical call to facilitate reconciliation, not violence, could not be any clearer to me. And this responsibility of peacemaking is not conditional. It's universal.\n\nMy beliefs are rooted in my experiences as an activist in the movement to save black lives. Where everyday I marched and protested on the Ferguson front lines - frequently joined by my Jewish and Palestinian siblings, might I add - demanding an end to the violence, brutality, and oppression that is killing black people in America. My commitment to ending violence, brutality, and oppression is not conditional. It's universal.\n\nMy beliefs are also rooted in my experiences as a congresswoman. My commitment to the people of Missouri's First District has always been to do the absolute most to save lives, starting with those with the greatest need. Over the past week, many of my constituents have called my office, leaving anguished voicemails urging me, urging all of us in Congress, to stop a humanitarian catastrophe in Palestine and Israel right now.\n\nOne of the constituent voicemails that plays over and over in my head is from a woman who said, \"I'm calling as a Jewish person. Even though I know it's probably futile, I urge you to continue to advocate for a cease-fire and to advocate for the lives of Gazans.\" She then began to weep and hung up in tears. Our empathy and solidarity cannot be conditional. It must be universal.\n\nThis is why I'm so proud to be leading this resolution alongside my extraordinary and courageous colleagues today. Because I promised to save lives. Because I see the shared struggles between the people of Ferguson and the people of Palestine, between the people in St Louis and the people in Israel. Because I preach the notability of peace. Because I'm against human rights violations wherever they occur. Because I'm against state-sanctioned violence wherever it happens. Because I want equality, justice, safety, and dignity for everyone. And because I have love for the Israeli and Palestinian people who are suffering because of this violence and the inability of our governments to resolve the root causes of systemic oppression, military occupation, and the crimes of apartheid.\n\nYou don't have to be a pastor, or an activist, or a congressperson to understand the value of human life. You only need to be willing to choose the tougher course of love and peace over the easier path of hatred and violence. You must allow yourself to be consistent in your love and respect for humanity. You must not let yourself turn a blind eye to the mass murder of Palestinians, even as we strongly condemn Hamas for its appalling attack against Israelis. Together, we must work to end the violence in the short and long term.\n\nViolence will never bring us peace. Violence leads to more violence. Together, we must be bold. We must stand on the side of humanity. We must stand on the side of justice. We must stand on the side of equality. We must stand on the side of self-determination. We must stand on the side of love. We must stand on the side of safety. We must stand on the side of peace. And we must be willing to speak out against war and violence - and against our government's complicity in it.\n\nIn this moment, ask yourselves: Are you for war or against war? Are you for saving lives or against saving lives?\n\nThe time to decide is now. Because we need a cease-fire now . We need peace now . The United States government has a responsibility to use every diplomatic tool we have to demand and mediate de-escalation, the safe return of hostages, and accountability for all perpetrators who dare violate international human rights laws.\n\nYou know, Dr [Martin Luther] King [Jr] was once denounced for daring to speak out against the Vietnam War. He said : \"We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation and for those it calls 'enemy,' for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.\"\n\nTo my colleagues in Congress, I urge you to choose humanity. Choose peace. Choose love. Choose courage. Join this resolution now.\n\nI'm so grateful to my colleagues and the advocates, faith leaders, organizers, affected people, and families who are supporting this effort. Know that we will not back down until there is peace. We need a cease-fire now .\n\nThank you.\n\nCori Bush is a registered nurse, pastor, activist, and US representative for Missouri's 1st District.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Her reelection is a priority for progressive forces everywhere.\n\nUS representative Cori Bush makes a speech at a pro-Palestine rally in Washington, DC, on April 20, 2024.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nUp until now, despite billions of dollars and unmeasurable institutional power on its side, the ruling class has struggled to unseat the Squad, the bloc of eight democratic socialists and progressives in Congress elected in the wake of Bernie Sanders's 2016 campaign, a group of movement leaders who have helped elevate the concept of democratic socialism from a personal eccentricity of one gruffly lovable Vermont grandfather to a central tenet of millennial and Gen Z left movements. Indeed, until last month, no challenge - Republican or Democrat - to the Squad had been successful.\n\nBut the group's strong support for a cease-fire in Gaza has activated the big money of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and other pro-Israel groups, and in June, for the first time, a Squad member lost his race. Jamaal Bowman, even with Jewish Voice for Peace, Justice Democrats, Democratic Socialists of America, and other left groups phone banking and door knocking for him, was unable to prevail against an opponent backed by more than $14 million in AIPAC funds. (Bowman's opponents also needed a redistricting that was highly in their favor, icing out much of Bowman's natural working-class constituency in favor of a richer, more suburban one.)\n\nNow it's possible the Squad may lose another member to the same pro-genocide money machine: Rep. Cori Bush , a nurse, Black Lives Matter activist, socialist , and fighter for the working class.\n\nDuring Bush's time in Congress, she has pursued a strong progressive agenda on renewable energy, climate resilience, public transit, environmental justice, veterans' health, and women's rights. Like her fellow Squad members, Bush has elevated left and working-class concerns in national political discourse and pushed the Democrats left, strengthening legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nAlong with the rest of the Squad, Bush has stood against the war on Gaza . Bush boycotted Benjamin Netanyahu's horrific speech to Congress on Wednesday; she authored a cease-fire resolution and called for the United States to stop funding Israeli crimes, deeming it \"unconscionable for the United States government to continue enabling mass atrocities.\" She has framed such calls not only in the context of empathy for a people under siege but also of American working-class well-being: \"We should be prioritizing the needs of our communities. That means funding public housing, healthcare and education - not endless war.\"\n\nStrong stances like these attracted AIPAC to her race; calls for human flourishing rather than bloody misery don't go unchallenged by the group. Wesley Bell, Bush's opponent and St. Louis County district attorney (DA), was polling at least seventeen points behind her in the race's early days. Now, with AIPAC and related group pouring millions into Bell's campaign - including $2.5 million on ads alone - the race was neck and neck last month, and some conservative media outlets have recently report ed a significant lead for Bell .\n\nBush is a strong left-wing congresswoman up against purveyors of death and right-wing reaction. With potentially some 186,000 dead in Gaza, and American workers under threat from false friends like J. D. Vance and Donald Trump, a socialist, antiwar nurse like Cori Bush in Congress is vital.\n\nBut Bush's opponent is also grim. Despite running in a Democratic primary, Bell is friendly with Republicans. He served as campaign manager to a Republican friend with antiabortion politics, and like Jamaal Bowman's opponent, George Latimer, Bell has has taken donations from Republicans like hedge-funder Daniel Loeb .\n\nAs prosecutor of St. Louis County, the site of Michael Brown's 2014 murder, Bell opted not to prosecute Darren Wilson, the cop who killed Brown - a move that sparked mass demonstrations all over the country.\n\nBell hasn't changed much since. A report on his tenure released last week by Prosecutor Watch, a coalition of St. Louis racial justice groups including Forward Through Ferguson and Action St. Louis, shows that the jail population has not been reduced during his tenure as prosecutor, and transparency from the DA's office is still lacking. Even before assuming his current office, as municipal judge of Velda City, Bell was sued for presiding over a fixed cash bail system that was alleged to be abusive to impoverished defendants.\n\nBell was originally going to challenge Republican senator Josh Hawley, a fight that could have united left and center in Missouri, but he decided to run against Cori Bush instead. Now Hawley is growing more influential , with the ascendance of fellow right-wing populist culture-warrior J. D. Vance, while Cori Bush may lose her seat to Bell.\n\nBell is far from the worst person in American politics. He did stop the criminalization of marijuana and of \"deadbeat dads\" as prosecutor, thus ending some state harassment of poor and working-class people. Bell has also kept a campaign promise not to impose the death penalty.\n\nBut taking genocidal money to unseat a fighter like Bush, while leaving in office a true right-winger like Hawley, would be a massive setback to left causes and another victory for AIPAC and its allied groups who want more blood in Gaza. Her reelection is a top priority for those who envision a better world.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Apparently, punching left with AIPAC's support is a more appealing career booster than challenging the Right.\n\nRep. Cori Bush on Capitol Hill on March 12, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn 2006, Wesley Bell attended a $2,000-per-ticket event welcoming President George W. Bush to St Louis, Missouri. At the time, Bell was managing the campaign of Mark Byrne, a conservative Republican running for the MO-01 congressional seat on promises to oppose abortion and gun control. Byrne lost to Democrat Lacy Clay.\n\nIn 2014, Bell changed course and marched in the Ferguson protests after the police murder of Michael Brown. Most believe Bell's political career began with this involvement in the Black Lives Matter movement, and Bell is relying on this reputation in his current campaign against progressive Democratic congresswoman Cori Bush. But his history and his allegiances deserve far more scrutiny.\n\nIn 2018, riding the wave of Black Lives Matter, Bell ran for St Louis County Prosecutor as a progressive Democrat. He channeled the intense desire for a change in Missouri's draconian criminal justice system and won, taking the political establishment by surprise. Bell's predecessor, Bob McCulloch, had failed to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who killed Michael Brown over petty shoplifting. Bell promised he would bring charges against Wilson. But in August 2020, he changed his mind and decided not to.\n\n\"It was a betrayal,\" said Justin Hansford, a St Louis activist and director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University, in an interview with the Intercept . \"There were a lot of people who spent a lot of time and energy supporting Bell specifically because they expected him to at the very least reopen the case and let the family have their day in court, so that the facts could be put forth in a trial, and so that everyone could see them. It would have given us a sense of transparency.\"\n\nStill, Bell's profile rose in the Missouri Democratic Party, and in early 2024, he announced a run for Senate against Josh Hawley, a self-declared Christian Nationalist . The Ferguson protests featured prominently in Bell's early campaign material. \"Ferguson made me realize there was more I could do,\" Bell said. Bell argued that Hawley's agitational behavior during the January 6 protests stoked the fires of unrest. \"When I faced chaos in Ferguson, I worked to calm tensions,\" Bell said. \"But when Josh Hawley was faced with chaos, he chose to inflame it.\" Hawley's January 6 behavior was beginning to prove a major liability, with one wealthy and well-connected donor admitting that supporting Hawley's rise \"was the worst mistake I ever made in my life,\" making him feel something akin to \"what Dr Frankenstein must have felt.\"\n\nBut rather than build his campaign against Hawley, Bell dramatically shifted his priorities, pivoting to mount a challenge against a left-wing Missouri politician instead. Last June, Bell called Cori Bush to promise he wouldn't run against her. Then, after the Hamas attack in Israel on October 7 and the outbreak of Israel's assault on Gaza, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) \"let it be publicly known that a challenger to Bush would have effectively bottomless fundraising support,\" writes Ryan Grim. Bell subsequently dropped out of his race against Hawley and turned around to challenge Bush. This opened the floodgates for the Israel lobby, which has spent a staggering $7 million on Bell's run to capture Bush's seat.\n\nAs of July 2024, AIPAC's massive donations only account for 62 percent of Bell's contributions - in part because Missouri Republicans have lavished Bell's coffers. The Huffington Post reported that Bell's campaign filings included donations \"from notable sources such as Steven Tilley, a GOP former Missouri House speaker who's now a lobbyist,\" and \"Daniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Third Point, who has donated millions to Republican causes.\"\n\nWorld Wide Technology's David Steward, a conservative tech billionaire from St Louis, also supports Bell. \"Steward recently served as the finance chair of a super PAC that supported Sen. Tim Scott's (R-SC) run for president,\" the Huffington Post reported. \"All told, Bell raised more than $65,000 from donors who also gave to one of Missouri's two Republican senators, Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, in their most recent campaigns, or Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, the leading Republican candidate for governor.\"\n\nBell had gone from opposing Hawley to raking in donations from the same people supporting his former opponent. Rather than try to turn a red seat blue, Bell apparently felt his political career was better served by a well-funded challenge against a fellow Democrat in a safe blue seat.\n\nBefore 2014, Cori Bush was employed as a nurse. She ran on a platform advocating \"black maternal health, abortion rights and diverting money from law enforcement to public services,\" all issues integral to the lives of working-class black women like herself. Bush's priorities also include passing the pro-union PRO Act, expanding Medicare until it's Medicare for All, passing the Green New Deal, and raising the minimum wage to $25 an hour.\n\nIn 2023, Bush secured millions of dollars in emergency funding after catastrophic flooding ravaged St Louis. Her office is now focused on preparing St Louisans for the future, which promises more extreme weather that will compound the manifold environmental issues facing Missouri and hit working-class people hardest.\n\nEnvironmental justice is a key issue for Bush, who is also attempting a major nuclear waste removal from schools and residential backyards. Contaminated by Mallinckrodt-refined uranium during the Manhattan Project, the price tag for the cleanup of Coldwater Creek is over $400 million , totaling $2.6 billion in environmental liabilities that only grow year after year as the contamination seeps and spreads around in flooding. Due to the cost, politicians have been disinclined to touch the cleanup project, and residents have paid a steep price. The zip codes that Cold Water travels through in north St Louis County have elevated levels of cancer. \"Every man on my block died of stomach or intestinal cancer,\" said Representative Doug Clemens of St Ann. Bush is pursuing legislation that will clean up the contamination.\n\nBush's advocacy for increased public investment to improve conditions for working-class St Louisans has won her few friends in elite corridors. But it's her position on Gaza that has made her the target of right-wing spending in this race. The congresswoman was one of the first to file legislation calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. She has also shown stalwart support for activists in her home district.\n\nMO-01 is home to large assembly facilities for the Boeing Cooperation , with many military-industrial contractors scattered throughout. On April 15, pro-Palestine activists blocked the gates of the Boeing manufacturing plant in St Charles, Missouri. Boeing manufactures military weapons from drones to missiles to jets, many of which are used by the Israel Defense Forces in its assault on Gaza.\n\nThe following month, another round of protests occurred in St Louis, also related to Boeing. In May, Washington University students formed a Palestinian solidarity encampment. Protesters pointed to the university's connections with Boeing and demanded disinvestment. In response, the university declared the encampment illegal and deployed police to aggressively arrest the protesters. \"There were brutalizing assaults,\" sophomore León-Díaz said. \"It was jarring to see my friends being treated like empty sacks of organs, entirely dehumanized, with no respect for their dignity.\" Over one hundred students, teachers, and activists were cuffed.\n\nBush aligned herself with the protesters, saying, \"Solidarity with antiwar student activists at WashU.\" Megan Green, president of the St Louis Board of Aldermen, told Jacobin :\n\nCongresswoman Bush organized a call with all the students and impacted faculty in the days after the brutality to hear their stories and how Washington University's heavy-handed response impacted them. She immediately contacted the university to attempt to open up a dialogue between the administration and students.\n\nIt is this activity that has opened up Bush's race to a flood of donations from AIPAC and right-wing pro-Israel donors.\n\nDrive through the district's rich white neighborhoods like Webster and the Central West End, and you will see many Wesley Bell yard signs - some with pro-Israel signs as well. But in MO-01, the white enclaves are a minority. Bush's strongest districts are in the predominantly black neighborhoods in North St Louis. She is most popular among those living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIt's unclear if Bell's spending will sway those voters. In any case, there is no organic call for a tack to the center in MO-01. As Green told Jacobin , \"We currently have alignment in our city politics between local and congressional representation. Bell winning threatens to disrupt that collaboration and uniform vision. Cori fights with us and having that type of leadership is essential to creating a St Louis that thrives.\"\n\nBush's seat is a valuable one for the Democratic Party because it's so secure - a rare position inside a heavily gerrymandered red state where left values have a loud voice. The urban blue islands of Missouri are the state's only counterbalance to uniform Republican rule.\n\nIn this environment, Bell is trying hard to shore up his progressive bona fides. But in one telling twist, a campaign ad depicting him speaking at a Ferguson rally in 2014 shows Bush, too, standing behind him in the crowd. This snapshot hints at the central difference between Bush and Bell. Do the core values of the Black Lives Matter movement, which was born in St Louis, stop at the perimeter of the United States? Bell believes those values do not apply to Gazans. Bush believes they do.\n\nThese are the higher-level, more theoretical stakes of the race. But while Israel plays a major role in determining the allocation of money, on the ground, the election is about resource allocation.\n\nBell's message is that he is every bit as progressive as Bush, but is also - at the same time and without conflict - friendlier to corporations and big business. Older, richer people in St Louis believe they'll get something out of Bell that Bush isn't offering. If they turn out in larger numbers, Bell will win. But if younger, more progressive people of color turn out, Bush will win. The vote is on August 6.\n\nDevin Thomas O'Shea's writing has appeared in the Nation , Protean , Current Affairs , Boulevard , and elsewhere.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn October 27, just twenty days into the war in Gaza, Congresswoman Cori Bush introduced a resolution calling for a cease-fire. In the months since, many have smeared her as an antisemite or a supporter of Hamas, but a quick glance at the remarks she delivered in the House that day - which were subsequently reprinted in Jacobin - shows that these allegations are pure nonsense. She repeatedly talked about the plight of the Israeli hostages, reasoning that it's essential to de-escalate the conflict so they can be brought home to their families. She said, \"We strongly condemn Hamas for its appalling attack against Israelis.\" Over and over again, she referenced the humanity of \"Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Muslims\" and used phrases like \"my Jewish and Palestinian siblings.\"\n\nHer crime, in the eyes of the Democratic establishment, wealthy pro-Israel donors, and much of the media, is that she takes the humanity of all of these groups equally seriously. For Bush, condemnation of Hamas, while correct, can't be used as an excuse to support the American-backed \"mass murder of Palestinians.\" That would violate her \"strong belief that all human life is equally precious.\"\n\nThis is the belief that so infuriated the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which Jacobin 's Liza Featherstone aptly calls a \"pro-genocide money machine.\" To punish Bush, AIPAC dangled massive amounts of money before anyone who would primary her. A challenger rose to the occasion, and with AIPAC's endless resources at his disposal, he won.\n\nWhatever you think about any other aspect of Bush's politics or record, this much is crystal clear: as millions of Palestinians have been driven from their homes in a blatant campaign of ethnic cleansing, and more children have been killed in Gaza than had been killed in all the war zones in the world in the previous four years, Cori Bush took a stand for basic human decency - and for that crime, she was drummed out of Congress.\n\nBush's successful primary challenger, Wesley Bell, originally planned to challenge far-right Republican Josh Hawley for his Senate seat. If he'd won that race, Bell would have been an improvement over Hawley. While Hawley makes a show of pretending to be a new kind of \"pro-worker\" conservative, even a mediocre Democrat like Bell would have presumably gotten behind the PRO Act to make it easier to organize unions - which Hawley continues to oppose .\n\nLast summer, Joe Holleman of the St Louis Post-Dispatch asked in his column whether Bell's actual plan was to raise his profile in the state with a fake run against Hawley and then switch to a run for Bush's House seat. Bell was apparently so aghast that anyone would suggest this that he called Bush to reassure her that he had no such intention. You can listen to a recording of that call here .\n\nAt the time, he might have even been telling the truth. As Drop Site News 's Ryan Grim puts it, though, after Bush took the lead in the movement for a cease-fire after October 7, AIPAC \"let it be publicly known that a challenger to Bush would have effectively bottomless fundraising support.\" We have every indication that this was decisive in nudging Bell to get into the race against Bush. As of last month, fully 62 percent of Bell's campaign funds came from AIPAC-linked donations.\n\nIt's evident to the naked eye that AIPAC bought Bush's seat. But opponents of the Left are twisting themselves in knots to claim otherwise, insisting that actually the people had spoken about Bush's inattention to their needs. Writing in Compact , Alexander Nazaryan opines that:\n\nThe reality is that you can influence an American election, but you can't buy one. And Bush left herself vulnerable to such influence by catering to her brand more than to her constituents.\n\nNazaryan, who seems to have little to no idea what local issues were in play in the race, only gives us one example of Bush allegedly neglecting her constituents on domestic issues. She voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill. That's it.\n\nWhy did she cast that vote? He doesn't say, but it's easy enough to look up. The original Build Back Better package was supposed to include all sorts of measures that would materially help Bush's low-income constituents, like universal pre-K, free community college, and universal paid family and medical leave. These are all popular and desperately needed measures. They were sacrificed at the altar of \"bipartisanship\" even though there were enough Democratic votes to pass the whole thing through the reconciliation process.\n\nAt the time, Democratic leadership claimed that they were pursuing a \"two-track\" strategy. The Chamber of Commerce-friendly infrastructure stuff would get passed through Congress, and all the controversial stuff that would help the working class at the expense of billionaires would be passed \"later\" through reconciliation. Anyone who wouldn't be routinely fooled by the \" wallet inspector \" in the Simpsons could see through it, and Bush did. If more Democrats had voted the way she did, the fight for paid family and medical leave and the rest might have lived to fight another day. That's neglecting her constituents?\n\nDevin Thomas O'Shea, who has a better grasp on local politics in Missouri than Nazaryan, sharply captured the difference in the two candidates' messaging. Bell claimed to be just as \"progressive\" as Bush but \"also - at the same time and without conflict - friendlier to corporations and big business.\" Initially, Bell's message didn't seem to be landing, with Bush beating him by at least seventeen points in the beginning. A staggering eight million dollars from AIPAC, and a surprising - or maybe not so surprising - number of donations from Republicans who'd also given to Bell's original opponent Josh Hawley, made Bell a contender.\n\nNo election outcome is monocausal. There are always decisions that could have been made differently. For example, it was probably a mistake for Bush to refuse to debate Bell. She said she wouldn't \"platform\" a candidate swimming in Republican money. The problem with that is that the money already gave Bell a massive platform, and Bush could have only benefited from calling out his support of the business elite and of Palestinian genocide.\n\nAll the same, the claim that \"you can influence an American election, but you can't buy one\" is vacuous wordplay. If you can buy influence, and that influence is decisive in tilting the election, that's what everyone everywhere means by \"buying an election.\" And there's no gainsaying that this is exactly what happened in Bush's race. AIPAC money is what tempted Bell to run, and without it he wouldn't have won.\n\nThe usual pro-genocide ghouls will claim that telling the truth about AIPAC buying the seat is antisemitism because it promotes a narrative about \"Jewish money.\" That's nonsense, and not just because Jewish peace groups worked hard to reelect Bush or because plenty of pro-Israeli donors are Christians. The deeper issue is that parsing the accurate observation about AIPAC as a claim about \"Jews,\" thereby equating AIPAC with the entire Jewish people - as if entire ethnicities were hive minds that held collective political opinions and collectively acted in the political process - is itself deeply antisemitic.\n\nEven before October 7, well over a third of young American Jews told pollsters that Israel was an \"apartheid state.\" Since then, millions of Israel's noncitizen subjects have been ethnically cleansed from their homes. Common sense would suggest that the number has gone up.\n\nJews are people, and people have different political opinions. And everyone, regardless of ethnicity or religion, has more power to promote their political opinions - and punish politicians who disagree - if they're wealthy. That's on the long list of reasons it's obscene for a society to allow this much economic inequality, and to allow money to so profoundly influence politics.\n\nThe reality here is very simple. Cori Bush stood up against genocide, and so the power of organized money crushed her. Don't let anyone tell you different.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe moral arc of the universe bends toward justice, says Rep. Cori Bush - but only if we pull it.\n\nRep. Cori Bush at the \"How We Win\" conference in Washington, DC, held June 16 and 17. (Polina Godz / Jacobin)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn June 16 and 17, Jacobin, the Nation, and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Fund brought together eighty socialist elected officials and their staff in Washington, DC, for the \"How We Win\" conference, the first gathering of elected socialists in the United States in decades. Rep. Cori Bush gave the opening plenary address. We reproduce that speech to an audience of elected officials here, edited for length and clarity.\n\nI want to start by saying this: I love you. I love us.\n\nI say it all the time, because love must be at the center of our work as a movement interested in the public good. I am someone who happens to believe that we cannot serve that which we don't love, not adequately. There are a lot of people who think they're doing good things. But while they think they're doing good, they're actually hurting others. Because the heart of it is, \"I want to be seen doing good. I want people to say I did a good job.\" Because the unconditional love for the people is missing, they missed the mark.\n\nVoters have said to me, \"Cori, I don't really care if you love me or not - just serve me.\" And I'll say, \"No, that's what you're used to. You're used to people just doing something for you and then moving you out of the way.\"\n\nThat's not who you get when you have folk like us that actually love humanity. Because we don't care if you voted for us or not as a condition of whether we help you. We care if you eat, if you have clean clothes, if you have clean air and clean water. We care if your child is safe in school. We care about all of those things, whether you vote for us or not. So know that when I go to work every single day, I do so with love.\n\nI tell my folk in St Louis all the time, \"Your congresswoman loves you.\" Why? Because I learned on the streets of Ferguson [Missouri] that we have to put out our own narrative. We create it, and then we have to push it out. We push that narrative. I realized that so many people just don't get to know, because they don't hear it, that somebody loves them. I need people to know that's who they get when they get me. I don't care if you like me or not; I'm going to love you out of your mess or out of your heartache, out of your underresourcedness.\n\nShout-out to the St Louis Democratic Socialists of America for all that they've done for me. Shout out to all the elected officials that are here in the room. Thank you for what you're doing in your communities. And I want to shout out to my team for being here. And my husband.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders - I want to shout out the good senator. Because Bernie Sanders believed in me in 2016 back when other folks didn't. In my very first race, Bernie Sanders put me on his stage, at one of his rallies for president. He put this dark-skinned black woman with these braids on his stage. It was a big deal because so many people thought I looked unprofessional. I was still a Ferguson activist, so close to the movement. He didn't care. That moment onstage changed my life. So I always have to shout out Senator Sanders for seeing and doing something that other people were afraid to do.\n\nThe moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. This is what we know. This is the thing: it only does that if we pull it. Pulling that arc is hard; it's tiring. Our collective struggle, our mission, is so intertwined. What happens over there happens over here. Our struggles are so connected, and therefore our push for equality and our push for justice is connected too.\n\nI am one of the forty million people in our country who descend from enslaved Africans. Our ancestors were torn away from their homes and their families. Enslaved, brutalized, sexually assaulted. Forced to fuel this country's economy since the day that it was founded, to the tune of over 222 million hours of forced labor, which today would look like somewhere around $97 trillion. Then they were left landless, impoverished, and disenfranchised. My people continue to bear the harms of slavery and its vestiges, through the racial wealth gap. We don't get to hear enough about the black-and-white wealth gap being $14 trillion.\n\nIn a just society, there would not be a wealth gap of trillions of dollars simply based upon race. Segregation, redlining, disparities in health care outcomes, a racist and destructive criminal legal system, and countless other toxic fruits of policy violence are perpetuated by our own federal government.\n\nSo I refuse to accept the status quo. That's who the folks in this room are - you don't accept the status quo. I refuse to accept the status quo, because the status quo of a system of oppression is oppression. I refuse to accept the status quo where our so-called justice system sees black and brown and indigenous people as more criminal. Seeing us as dangerous allows police to brutalize us and kill our people with impunity, then turn around and perpetually increase no-strings-attached money for policing and wars while stripping our communities of the critical funding needed for us to stay alive. I refuse to accept the status quo, where Juneteenth is a federally celebrated holiday but reparations are a nonstarter for the elected officials who will gladly go and attend those Juneteenth parades.\n\nI refuse to accept the status quo where people are paid $7.25 an hour while corporate profits soar and executives capitalize off of the crisis of \"greedflation.\" I refuse to accept the status quo that allows our trans siblings to be targeted by legislation all over the country by people who want to attack and hurt other people. I refuse to be silent. I won't be silent, and I know you won't either.\n\nI refuse to accept the status quo that funds the oppression of our Palestinian siblings and of communities striving for liberation and self-determination worldwide. I refuse to accept the status quo that says unhoused people are a stain on our society. Everyone deserves housing. And we have the resources to provide that as a guarantee. We just don't use them.\n\nI refuse to accept the status quo where we destroy our environment because big oil CEOs want another yacht. I refuse to accept the status quo that burdens everyday people with medical debt and education debt. In this nation, the wealthiest nation in the world, people should not have to go into debt to stay alive or to get an education.\n\nI refuse to accept the status-quo immigration system that routinely defies international law over and over and over again and treats those seeking refuge in our country with contempt and with criminalization. I refuse to accept the status quo where police can shoot someone fifty-seven times for protesting \"a training facility\" being built. Rest in power, Tortuguita .\n\nI refuse to accept the status quo that sees the issues I just named as acceptable, as part of society, as the way we've always done it - but the solutions to these issues, they see as radical. It's the proliferation of these issues that is radical. The solutions to them are what's rational, how we actually help people, how we touch our communities.\n\nBecause if people don't feel the change, then you really didn't change much harm.\n\nWe know that the people are with us. People are fed up with the status quo. We see it. We hear it all the time. And so we need that all-hands-on-deck approach to enlist people. To pull on that power. Like the folks in this room, like the elected officials - we need that. We need it at the local level. We need it at the state level. We need it at the federal level. The people-powered movement is gaining momentum each and every time another one of us wins, every time another one of us runs.\n\nWe are transforming the way that people do politics. It is with your help that more candidates like us get to Congress, more candidates get into races and seats all over the country. But I think about when people say to me, \"Well, I didn't win. So I'll just go do something else. But I'm so proud of you.\" I have to remind them that I ran three times. I ran consecutively three times without stopping, while my heart was bruised, while I was embarrassed and humiliated. Because people believed in me.\n\nI thought I knew what I was talking about, and I thought people would support that. And people did, but it didn't look like it by the vote. I just was crushed. But in all of my heart, I remembered the vision before me was to take care of all the people. I had to start with making sure I kept my own kids alive. So I couldn't understand how I could be told, \"You didn't win. It's because people don't believe in you. So just don't run again.\" But how do I keep my son alive if I can't use my voice? I've already been beating the street with my feet, my mouth, and my hands for hundreds of days. I gotta do something more.\n\nI know that you're going to keep working for policies that lift all of us up. I know that you won't stop. For those of you who are running right now, I know you're elected, but some of you are still running - don't stop. Don't stop. Even if you don't get it, don't stop. Don't stop, because the momentum that you push in your community, somebody else is going to catch that. Now, it might not have happened for you, but it may happen for the person that was watching you. It may happen for the person that was next to you.\n\nThis movement is big. When people tell us, \"The Squad is six people\" - no, the Squad is all of us. We can't do this alone. We need everybody's support as we organize and legislate in Congress for an agenda that puts people first. We need more voices in Congress. We need more voices in our state legislatures. We need more voices in our city councils. We need your voices.\n\nYou are the light. \"This little light of mine. I'm gonna let it shine.\" I don't sing that. I say, \"This mighty light of mine. I'm gonna let it shine.\" Because this is it. What I have, I take that, and I give it out to you, and then you take that, and you give it to somebody else. We need more of you that believe what you believe. Don't just hold that for yourself. Make sure you're passing it out to the folks next to you. So when you speak, make sure you bring in somebody else, because we've got to grow this movement. You've got to duplicate yourself. You're not a leader if you can't duplicate you in spirit.\n\nI love you. I'm so grateful to every single one of you for your partnership. We fight forward to deliver student debt cancellation. We fight forward to expand voting rights. We fight forward to dismantle white supremacy everywhere. We fight forward to fix our US Supreme Court, to redefine public safety, to prevent hateful violence, to ensure environmental justice, to enshrine reproductive freedom, to transform our immigration system, to believe and support victims and survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence, to save lives through gun-violence prevention laws, and so much more.\n\nOur work is just getting started, y'all. So let's keep going. Let's keep fighting this oppressive status quo in favor of a world that is fundamentally just, kind, and loving.\n\nCori Bush is a registered nurse, pastor, activist, and Missouri Democratic congressional candidate.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nEarlier this month, Cori Bush ousted a ten-time incumbent to become Democratic nominee for Missouri's 1st congressional district. She told Jacobin how her experience as a BLM and public housing activist shaped her campaign - and how she's planning to bring the movements' demands into Congress.\n\nOn August 4, Cori Bush defeated ten-time incumbent William Lacy Clay to become Democratic nominee for Missouri's 1st congressional district.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn August 4, Cori Bush defeated ten-time incumbent William Lacy Clay to become Democratic nominee for Missouri's 1st congressional district. Her victory in this November's general election is all but a shoo-in, in a heavily Democratic area covering parts of St. Louis County and St. Louis city.\n\nMarking the end of fifty years' control by Clay and his father before him, Bush's win sets her up to become the first black woman to represent the district. She achieved this after playing an active role in the multiple uprisings associated with St. Louis's Black Lives Matter movement, following the murder of Michael Brown in 2014 and the 2017 non-indictment of officer Jason Stockley for the murder of Anthony Lamar Smith.\n\nAlongside Bush's win, other results in St. Louis confirmed a shift in its politics, with the reelection of circuit attorney Kim Gardner and treasurer Tishaura Jones. All three are black women regarded as progressives; all three defeated more establishment Democrats despite the odds being stacked against them, from super PAC financing to media smears and racist and sexist slurs. Further signaling this sea change, it's been just two years since Bush ran and lost to Clay by a 20-point margin, in a campaign featured in the Netflix documentary Knock Down the House alongside her soon-to-be colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBush is proud of her activist record: \"I'm someone who, like so many in my city, has just been out in the streets now for years,\" she told Jacobin in a video call, \"putting our bodies, our jobs, and our livelihoods on the line, day after day. And we had someone representing us who had not been alongside us in those fights.\"\n\n\"It was 1968 when the incumbent's father was elected,\" Bush said. \"And he was seen as a civil rights activist and person on the streets. He was the kind of champion people wanted at that time, but it's been a different story ever since.\" Lacy Clay had been criticized for his connections to big bank donors such as JPMorgan Chase and Citibank ; for his links to lobbyists like the American Financial Services Association, Anheuser-Busch, and Boeing; and for voting to deregulate banks.\n\nClay's final attempt at maligning Bush was to cast her as anti-Israel for her support of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions). But Bush's campaign responded, saying she \"stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people, just as they have stood in solidarity with Black Americans fighting for their own lives.\" Her response is a hopeful sign that she'll bring movements' demands into the electoral arena - rather than cede to pressure from establishment Democrats to curtail them.\n\nThe race between Clay - himself something of a progressive, relative to the Democratic establishment, at least - and the activist Cori Bush was in many ways emblematic of the fork in the road facing the Democratic Party. On the two most controversial proposals in Democratic ranks in recent years - Medicare for All and the Green New Deal - both Bush and Clay voiced their support. But thereafter, the deeper conflicts of progressive politics are clear.\n\nWhile Clay opposed Obama-era attempts at containing the payday loan industry, Bush was personally caught up on the other side of that industry's treadmill of predatory, interest-accruing payments. As Clay was working through piecemeal reforms as chairman to the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance, Bush was herself experiencing the precarity of multiple evictions and stints of homelessness.\n\nJust two months before Michael Brown was murdered on August 9, 2014, Clay voted against curtailing military transfers to local police departments: those same weapons ( LRADs, MRAPs, M4 carbines, tear gas, and more ) were then used to brutalize Bush and many others in the Ferguson uprising. Following that revolt - and the criticism Clay faced over his vote - he did acknowledge the problem of police racism, but he portrayed it only in terms of a lack of diversity among police officers . Bush, on the other hand, supported a host of measures aimed at curtailing the carceral state, from defunding the police to immediately closing all private prisons and ending cash bail.\n\nIn short, Bush's politics were forged in the fire - literal and otherwise - of lived hardship and grassroots protest. And they seem to have found their match in these times of civil unrest and desperation. \"Now,\" Bush said, \"with these protests, the demand for someone who's been on the streets is back.\" But the journey was an uphill one.\n\n\"People saw me win and called it all 'Black Girl Magic,'\" Bush said, \"Look: it was hard, is what it was.\" Bush continued, \"The braids I wore, the size of my hips, those became bigger issues than the policies I was pushing. We aren't talking enough about what is happening to Black women, to minority women, Muslim women, trans women when we decide to run for office . . . I was still working full time while running a campaign for office. We really go through a lot to do all of this - but regular people need to be represented in Congress.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the issues, Bush is a strong progressive insurgent. As she told Jacobin , \"After COVID-19 arrived, everyone could see how I've been supporting Medicare for All since 2016, and now we understand why.\"\n\nBush had her own battle with the coronavirus in the midst of her campaign - putting her down for two months. \"But three days after I recovered, we were on the streets protesting the murder of Breonna Taylor. If people didn't understand why I was involved with the movement in 2014, they can see the persistence, the longevity of the commitment now.\" The progressive opinion is, through waves, becoming the majority one: this is especially true for issues like police brutality and access to health care .\n\nBush's election platform highlights, among other things, stronger social safety nets, the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and housing as a universal human right . This especially means support for low-income black and brown legacy residents, rent controls, and more public housing. In tandem with this, Bush vowed to fight predatory lending practices, strengthen unions, and implement a federally funded public banking system, a $15-per-hour minimum wage, and comprehensive criminal-justice and public-safety reform.\n\nFor now, however, Bush said her first push, once elected, will be the next pandemic relief package. She told Jacobin , \"We want $2,000 a month UBI [universal basic income] that's retroactive to the time of the $1,200 stimulus check and goes until this subsides; we want to extend the moratorium on evictions for another year; and we need to invest in public schools so that children, regardless of their learning environment, are able to be successful.\" Bush continued, \"We will be told we have to pick between money toward social programs and money in the form of stimulus checks. We don't - we can have both.\"\n\nGiven this kind of stance, Bush's victory has been compared to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's success in the New York primaries in 2018. Both women were embedded in and emerged from social movements, have working-class backgrounds, and, through their victories, unseated dynastic centrist Democrats.\n\nAlong with Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and a host of other women of color, Cori Bush now looks set to join an expanding bastion of progressive members of Congress. The list, as of this year, now includes Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones - both of New York.\n\nThis new wave has been widely associated with the consciousness-raising by social movements such as Occupy Wall Street since the 2008 financial crash. More recently, the successes of progressive black candidates at all levels of government has been linked to the various forms of advocacy, education, and transformations in public discourse driven by the BLM movement since 2013.\n\nThis is also the context in which groups like the Electoral Justice Project, Black Youth Project 100, and their ongoing abolitionist campaigns have flourished. \"She's being buoyed by this movement,\" Justice Democrats spokesperson Waleed Shahid said of Bush, \"and the movement's origin is in Ferguson.\"\n\nFollowing the uprising, Bush played a pivotal role in the Fight for 15 campaigns, cofounded the Truth Telling Project in 2015, worked with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and unions to defeat the right-to-work bill in Missouri, marched on the streets with environmental protesters, and supported closing the St. Louis debtors' prison: the Workhouse . It was after this that she turned to the electoral arena.\n\nFollowing Bernie Sanders' defeat in 2016, Justice Democrats was set up in order to scout and support progressive candidates for public office - and in 2017, Cori Bush was their first candidate. After the results came in this August 4, she took the microphone to shout out their support, while also thanking the Sunrise Movement, the DSA, Our Revolution, and Bernie Sanders - who ultimately raised around $100,000 for her campaign.\n\nIt's been less than a month since Bush's primary win, and despite her almost certain victory against Republican Anthony Rogers, she hasn't stopped her work of pushing her progressive agenda, especially in St. Louis.\n\nIn late July, St. Louis alderpersons voted to close the debtors' prison commonly known as the Workhouse. Some corporate Democrats attempted a bait and switch, with a bill to privatize the St. Louis Lambert International Airport. But Bush has opposed the privatization, like most other progressives and unions in the area. She intends to use her platform as a representative to Congress to highlight local issues such as these.\n\nSt. Louis DSA cochair Chris Ottolino agrees: \"Since Cori has won, we have already seen her trying to draw that parallel - what they are trying to do with the airport in St. Louis is very similar to what they are trying to do with the postal service at the national level.\" Since her victory, Bush has already endorsed several other progressives running for office - including Adrienne Bell for Texas's 14th District .\n\nEven if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do defeat Donald Trump in November, the ability of a handful of progressives to effect the far-reaching change being sought by movements like Black Lives Matter seems limited - in the short term, at least. This is especially true for Missouri's 1st District, which has often propelled African American representatives to Congress off the back of black-led social movements.\n\n\"The unspoken promise of racial representation is that social, economic, and political dynamics can change when someone from a marginalized group is at the helm. Too often, however, in Black politics, symbolism has stood in for making a meaningful difference in the lives of Black people,\" wrote Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor in the New Yorker .\n\nEarlier this month, Kamala Harris was nominated as Biden's running mate. Widely criticized for her record in deepening the crisis of incarceration in California, she had also backed Clay against Bush for Missouri's 1st District. This chasm at the heart of the Democratic Party is likely to deepen with a strengthened left wing in Congress.\n\nThe idea that elected representatives are responsible for the most disadvantaged among their constituents - or that they should be - has been one of the successes of recent social movements. But given the structure of Congress and the entanglements ahead, the demand for real accountability may seem almost impossible to fulfill. Amid rising unemployment and the brutal effects of the pandemic on the most marginalized communities across the United States, one thing is clear: a minority representation of progressives in Congress will not be enough.\n\nBush insists that once elected, she will use her platform as congresswoman while maintaining solid ties to her comrades. \"I have my mouth,\" she told us, \"and that's what I intend on using for a long time. And y'all gotta remember, I come with the whole activist community, I don't just come by myself.\" In this sense, Bush does not see electoral representation as being separate from activism: \"I'm going to Congress as a politivist - I'm still connected. If something happens in my district, and they are on the ground, well, I guess I'm coming back to march with my people, and I'll get in the street. I don't have to be on the sidewalk watching, like they say. Just because I'm in Congress doesn't mean I have to put that on the shelf and leave - I'm still here.\"\n\nClark Randall is an independent writer from St. Louis, now based in Berlin.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nFrom the New York State Legislature to the halls of Congress, democratic socialist elected officials have been taking a brave stand against the bloodshed in Gaza - and calling for an immediate cease-fire.\n\nCongresswomen Rashida Tlaib (pictured) and Cori Bush speak at a demonstration organized by progressive Jewish groups to call for a cease-fire at the US Capitol, October 18.

The hundreds of Palestinians seeking shelter there, as apartment blocks and entire civilian neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble throughout Gaza, were given yet another reminder that there are no safe places in that tiny strip of land, which millions aren't allowed to leave.\n\nIsraeli officials have been remarkably blunt about how little effort they're making to target Hamas fighters as opposed to simply piling up Palestinian corpses and hoping the fighters are somewhere in the mix. Israel's ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, compared the bombing of Gaza to the Allies' indiscriminate firebombing of Dresden during World War II, saying that it was the only way to beat the Nazis, and similarly this is the only way to defeat Hamas - never mind that numerous legal experts have called the bombing of Dresden a war crime. Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, says that the civilian population is responsible for the crimes of Hamas - even though Hamas never won an outright majority in any election, and about half of Gaza residents weren't alive when the last election happened - because the Palestinians haven't overthrown Hamas in an uprising.\n\nThe presidency is a mostly ceremonial role in the Israeli system, but Herzog being able to say something like that without having to resign in shame is profoundly telling. The Israeli government has been quite open about the strategy to deny millions of civilians food, water, and medicine as a pressure tactic against Hamas, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the conflict - which, remember, is taking place entirely within territory that Israel has controlled since 1967 - in existential and apocalyptic terms.\n\nThis is hard to see as anything but an outright ethnic-cleansing campaign being carried out with American weapons and funds. And from President Joe Biden on down, the entire spectrum of mainstream American politicians have been cheering and waving the Israeli flag, contravening the opinion of the American people. When Biden flew to Israel, he threw a few vague phrases into his speech about how the Israelis shouldn't go too far - but he made it abundantly clear that the United States would provide financial, military, diplomatic, and rhetorical cover to the Israeli state for as long as the bombs keep falling. That's the stance of most elected Democrats and the entire GOP, very much including the hardcore MAGA types who sometimes posture as antiwar when the subject is the war in Ukraine.\n\nAgainst this grim background, the elected officials affiliated or allied with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have taken a remarkably brave stand on behalf of a cease-fire, de-escalation, and moves toward a just and lasting peace.\n\nEven many fairly progressive Democrats have refused to take the same stand, whether out of cowardice or (more disturbingly) genuine support for Israel's war crimes in Gaza. Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA), for example, has taken better-than-average stands on several issues - but his political director just resigned after only two weeks on the job because of the congressman's refusal to call for a cease-fire.\n\nLast week, I wrote that DSA-endorsed congresswomen Cori Bush and Rashida Tlaib had shown unusual courage and moral leadership in making statements that condemned Hamas's violence against civilians while also \"acknowledging Palestinian humanity and talking about the roots of the cycle of violence in the ugly realities of Israeli apartheid\" - at a time when almost all of their colleagues were condemning Hamas, and only Hamas, and implicitly or explicitly supporting everything Israel had already started to do in Gaza.\n\nIt didn't go without saying that they'd take this stand. Some members of the squad of congressional leftists have wavered on such questions before. Notoriously, in 2021, Jamaal Bowman voted to fund Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system - on top of the already massive amounts of US military aid already going to Israel - and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez changed her Iron Dome vote through tears from \"no\" to \"present\" at the last minute.\n\nIn this case, though, Bush and Tlaib have gotten the entire Squad to cosign their resolution calling for a cease-fire. AOC's name is there. So is Jamaal Bowman's. So is the name of Ayanna Pressley - a moderate enough Squad member that she endorsed Elizabeth Warren when the rest of the group was supporting Bernie Sanders. So too is the name of Greg Casar, a DSA member who ended up cutting his ties with the group during his election campaign because of DSA's criticisms of his support for US aid to Israel. As of October 19, an approximately equal number of non-Squad members of Congress were also on the list .\n\nThis advocacy from the highest offices of elected democratic socialists has mirrored intense grassroots protests on behalf of a cease-fire - ranging from walkouts by high school students to a mass sit-in at the US Capitol by hundreds of Jewish progressives ( DSA members among them) brandishing signs declaring \"Not In Our Name\" and \"Ceasefire Now.\" Bush and Tlaib spoke outside the Capitol.\n\nSometimes the grassroots protests and the activity by elected officials have intersected, as when two DSA-endorsed members of the New York State Assembly, Zohran Mamdani and Marcela Mitaynes, joined a group of protesters blocking traffic outside the Brooklyn home of Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nAssemblyman Mamdani laid out the moral core of the protest in his quote to the media. \"So many of the New Yorkers who were there were people who had lost loved ones in the horrific attacks the prior Saturday,\" he said. \"And they were making it explicit that their grief should not be used as a justification to kill more innocent civilians. That war crimes cannot beget war crimes.\"\n\nGiven that the overwhelming majority of elected Democrats and Republicans have been on the wrong side, it's easy to remember that Mamdani and Mitaynes, the Squad, and other congresspeople calling for a cease-fire, and the hundreds of young progressive Jews who flooded the Capitol, are not only on the right side of history but that, in important ways, they represent the mainstream of American public opinion.\n\nWhile a majority of grassroots Republicans support sending weapons to Israel for this operation, a majority of grassroots Democrats, and an even larger majority of independents, oppose it. So do most Americans under the age of sixty-five, and a supermajority under the age of forty-five. And when you change the question to whether the United States should call for a cease-fire and de-escalation, 66 percent of Americans of all parties, and even 56 percent of Republicans, either somewhat or strongly agree.\n\nDemocratic socialists and a handful of their allies are the only politicians reflecting this view, but the disconnect between politicians and the rest of us is gigantic. And history won't be kind to the politicians who can't find the spine to call for the killing to stop.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

      "text": "One of the Most Vocal Proponents of a Ceasefire in Gaza Just Lost\n\nCori Bush is the second progressive Congress member to lose her seat after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Mother Jones; Sue Dorfman/ZUMA\n\nIn one of the most watched primaries this year, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.)-among the first members of Congress to call for a ceasefire-lost to St. Louis Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, who jumped into the race late, and with the backing of millions of dollars from pro-Israel groups . The Associated Press called the race for Bell around 10:00 PM local time.\n\n\"Organized people beat organized money,\" Bush's campaigners have repeated. This race, however, has tested whether that's true: as of election day, it is the second-most expensive Congressional primary in American history-and the money has, indeed, made a difference.\n\nBell dropped out of his bid to dethrone Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and chose to challenge Bush soon after the war began in Gaza. Bell has benefited from an incredibly well-funded advertising campaign since then.\n\nOver half of all the outside money spent on the race came from the United Democracy Project (UDP), the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)'s electoral arm. The money UDP spent here is second only to that which they spent on a successful campaign to defeat Rep. Jamaal Bowman in New York. In total, UDP spent nearly 9 million dollars in MO-01, bolstered by $1.5 million from the crypto PAC Fairshake. Bush and her backers also attracted some outside spending: Justice Democrats, a progressive PAC founded by former campaigners for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent $2 million her way.\n\nBell's choice to take that money has been divisive. Mike Jones, a 75-year-old former alderman and Board of Education member with a long career in St. Louis politics put it this way: \"I think everybody knows that the race is not about the issues that have surfaced. It's about the issue nobody's talking about.\" On most issues, Bell and Bush's stances are near-identical. \"So, literally, the only reason for this campaign, at a political level, is AIPAC money,\" Jones said.\n\nOver a quarter of children in the district live in poverty, per the latest census numbers. Schools in the City of St. Louis are so underfunded that the district may not have a full fleet of school bus drivers this year . Healthcare access in the district remains limited, particularly for Black women -and abortion, which both candidates hope to restore, remains illegal in the state.\n\nBut the millions brought into the district for this campaign by outside groups on both sides of the election are not doing much to address those issues. Instead, they're flooding people's mailboxes with fliers, often several per day, about Bush not backing Biden, as I previously reported .\n\nThe campaign became vitriolic in its final weeks. Each candidate has dealt with leaked, compromising audio recordings: Bell swearing he wouldn't run against Bush, only to renege on that promise; Bush comparing the DOJ investigation over her office's money-management practices to the FBI spying on Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe youth voter-engagement group Protect Our Power has been on the ground in St. Louis for the past month knocking on doors. Many of those canvassing are the same young campaigners who powered Jamaal Bowman's reelection campaign in New York, only to witness his defeat.  Ella Weber, 22, was one of those campaigners said she and her Protect Our Power co-campaigners \"went on a long walk\" that night \"and just like, talked about how important it was that we don't retreat.\" So they moved on quickly to the next \"Squad\" race to try again. They crashed on couches and canvassed for a month in St. Louis, working what Weber described as \"70-hour weeks\" for free. As they canvassed, though, they were up against a well-run and well-funded campaign on the other side.\n\n\"I think few times in my political experience have I seen it so clearly that voters are watching a lot of ads,\" said Denae Ávila-Dickson of Sunrise Movement.\n\n\"I think people power is still putting up a really, really strong fight against this historic funding,\" she told Mother Jones about 5 hours before the polls closed. \"But I think the reality is that our election systems aren't equipped to deal with the scale of spending that is in this race.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Can Cori Bush Hold On?\n\nPhotoillustration by Anthony Gerace\n\nJack McCordick February 1, 2024\n\nIn mid-October, Wesley Bell, St. Louis County's first-ever Black prosecuting attorney, appeared at a virtual event for Missouri Democratic voters eager to discuss the race he was running against Sen. Josh Hawley. \"We're in a place to get this guy,\" Bell boasted. Come Election Day, he said, \"I'm going to wake up either as the St. Louis County prosecutor or the US senator-elect.\"\n\nBut less than three weeks later, Bell abruptly called a press conference. Standing in front of a wall of posters bearing his name-and with the words \"U.S. Senate\" covered by white masking tape-Bell announced he'd instead decided to primary Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), one of the most progressive members of the House.\n\nBush had been making national headlines as a leading voice for a ceasefire in Gaza, where more than 6,000 Palestinians had already been killed in the Israeli bombardment launched after Hamas' October 7 terrorist attack. (As of this writing, the death toll has risen to over 26,000.) In a tweet a day prior to Bell's announcement, Bush had decried Israel's military operations as an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\" \n\nBell insisted there was \"nothing personal\" about his decision, but he called Bush's statements \"offensive\" and contrasted himself with her-on the war and more generally-by pledging to \"stand with the president.\" Asked by a reporter whether US aid to Israel should be conditioned on adherence to international law, he responded, \"I think we have to stand with our allies.\" And, drawing a clear contrast with his new opponent on criminal justice issues, Bell called Bush's support for defunding the police \"misguided,\" claiming it hurt Democrats electorally. The following day, he released a list of endorsements that included a number of prominent Jewish members of the St. Louis community, as well as a handful of police chiefs in the district.\n\nOn Tuesday, another possible line of attack emerged for Bell, as news broke that Bush was under federal investigation for allegedly misspending security money. (In late 2023, a congressional ethics board recommended a complaint regarding campaign funds being used to pay her husband for \"security\" be dismissed.)\n\nBell's decision makes Bush one of several members of the House's so-called squad to face primary challengers in the wake of October 7, as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) reportedly plans to spend $100 million to sideline Democrats it views as insufficiently supportive of Israel. \"I don't think we can talk about a Wesley Bell without talking about a George Lat­imer challenging Jamaal Bowman [in New York]; or without talking about a Bhavini Patel, who's challenging Summer Lee in Pennsylvania; or Don Samuels and Sarah Gad, who are still auditioning for who will get the AIPAC endorsement\" against Rep. Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, says Usamah Andrabi of Justice Democrats, a left-wing political action committee that first helped elect Bush in 2020. \"It is one big fight.\"\n\nBut the race also has a resonant local dimension: The primary is scheduled for August 6, 2024, just three days before the ten-year anniversary of the police killing of Michael Brown. The uprising that followed remade the politics of the region, and, in many ways, the entire country. For Bush and Bell the Ferguson protests also helped launch their political careers. The race will test which version of post-Ferguson politics still has a place in the Democratic Party.\n\nDemonstrators march in Ferguson on the first anniversary of Michael Brown's killing.\n\nScott Olson/Getty\n\nOn August 7, 2018, Mike Milton cried tears of joy. Bell's reform-minded campaign for prosecutor had just unseated Bob McCulloch, the 27-year incumbent who had declined to charge the police officer who shot Michael Brown in 2014, igniting months of protests in Ferguson, Missouri. During the campaign, Milton and Rodney Brown, a local community organizer, had helped knock on thousands of doors as part of Action St. Louis, a grassroots organization that emerged after the killing. Bell's upset victory reopened the possibility of a prosecution in the case. As the two activists shared a ride to Bell's victory party, Rodney Brown remembers thinking about how \"the protesting, the tear gas and the arrests, getting beat up by the cops, all of that came to this moment.\"\n\n\"It was a lot of joy,\" Milton recalls. \"I remember screaming to the top of our lungs.\" The St. Louis American , a venerable African American newspaper, would later name the entire \"Wesley Bell coalition\" as its \"person of the year.\"\n\nBut while Bell made strides in ending cash bail, his five-year tenure has largely disappointed the organizers who powered that coalition. Blake Strode, the executive director of ArchCity Defenders, a nonprofit civil rights firm in St. Louis, described Bell's prosecutorial record as \"very mixed.\" In a number of areas-including pretrial detention, police accountability, and the county's notorious practice of issuing \"wanteds,\" which allow police to make arrests without warrants-Strode argues that Bell's office has come up short. \"We thought we were getting a bold stand against the machine of mass incarceration,\" Milton says. \"And we just did not receive that.\"\n\nThomas Harvey, Strode's predecessor as executive director of ArchCity Defenders told me that Bell's tenure as prosecutor is evidence of how he \"never actually went to the place that [the] people in the streets he claims to have been working with\" wanted him to. \"He always very much-I would say consciously, because he's a smart guy-manipulated that middle ground,\" Harvey says. \"So he could represent to people in power that he was this person in the middle, and represent to the people who were in the streets, and finding their power, that he was on their side.\"\n\nFew moves stung more than when Bell announced, two months into the 2020 protests following George Floyd's murder, that he had decided not to seek charges over Michael Brown's death. \"I was shocked, sad, dismayed,\" Milton remembers. \"But at that point we already kind of knew how Wesley got down.\"\n\nThis year, when Bell announced his attempt to primary Bush, the response from many alums of the campaign to oust McCullough was swift. Just hours after Bell's press conference, Kayla Reed, the founder of Action St. Louis, wrote on Twitter that \"today is a great day to donate\" to Bush's campaign. It took Milton just four days to endorse the Congresswoman. \"Wesley Bell couldn't hold a flame,\" he wrote on Twitter. In an interview, I asked Brown what he would say if he had the chance to speak to the candidate he once put in so many hours of work to help elect. \"Drop out,\" he says. \"For the sake of the region, put your ego aside. Drop out of the race.\"\n\nIf Bell has kept Ferguson's protests at an arm's length-his campaign bio tactfully boasts he worked \"to calm tensions between residents and the police\"-the opposite is true of Bush, who's made her role in the uprising central to her political narrative and her stance on Gaza.\n\nDuring a speech on the House floor in 2021, Bush recalled \"sitting in a circle on the grass near where Michael Brown Jr. was murdered\" during the 2014 demonstrations with Palestinian American activists. \"I remember them describing to us what to do when militarized law enforcement shot us with rubber bullets or when they tear-gassed us,\" Bush said. \"I remember learning that the same equipment that they use to brutalize us is the same equipment that we send to the Israeli military to police and brutalize Palestinians.\" Bush wrote later that night on Twitter that \"the fight for Black lives and the fight for Palestinian liberation are interconnected.\"\n\nOn the day of Hamas' attack, she warned that \"a military response will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike\" and called on the United States to end support for \"Israeli military occupation and apartheid.\" A little more than a week later, Bush and 13 other representatives introduced a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire; over the next few months, it would garner 64 supporters. \"She's just been very consistent,\" says Sandra Tamari, who helped lead Palestinian American participation in the Ferguson protests.\n\nBush's statements immediately drew the ire of AIPAC, which accused her of \"giving a lifeline to a terrorist organization\" and endangering the safety of St. Louis residents. It released an ad targeting Bush for voting against a resolution supporting Israel's war. A political adviser for LinkedIn billionaire co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major funder of the Mainstream Democrats PAC, another pro-Israel PAC, told Jewish Insider in November that its donors were looking to fund attacks on Bush and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. He described it as a party effort to \"police their own extremists.\"\n\nBoth Bell and AIPAC declined to discuss their plans for the race. But a number of people I spoke with said they felt that the timing and tenor of Bell's entry pointed to the involvement of outside pro-Israel money. \"I think it's highly likely that AIPAC recruited him the way we have seen them recruiting other people to run against members of the squad,\" says Megan Green, a Bush supporter and president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, which in January voted in favor of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nWhile Bush said little publicly immediately upon Bell's entry to the race, in a November appearance on a Jewish Currents podcast, she described his decision to challenge her as a \"disheartening\" attempt to \"push a pro-war, pro-state-sanctioned-violence agenda.\" She also implied he was motivated by the financial support of pro-­Israel groups. \"I don't move because of money,\" she said. \"Some folks move because somebody flashed some dollar signs in front of them.\"\n\nThe degree to which a debate over Israel's war in Gaza will determine the outcome of a St. Louis congressional primary taking place in the late summer is still an open question. In past Democratic primaries, AIPAC ad campaigns have mostly stayed away from highlighting differences on Israel and Palestine to instead paint left-wing candidates as disloyal to party leadership. Bell previewed that attack against Bush at his campaign announcement, criticizing her votes against Biden's infrastructure bill and his deal to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n\"He's going to run as a Biden Democrat...as a Democratic team player,\" predicts Missouri Independent columnist Jeff Smith, a former state senator who used to represent parts of Bush's district. \"There's a constituency for that, in particular among older voters, white and Black.\" Bell's campaign rests not only on the polarizing war but on broader generational fissures that also play out in the debate over policing.\n\nSmith predicts that a strong fundraising start by Bell will spur significant investments from national groups. \"I would bet that he's going to end this quarter with more cash on hand,\" Smith says. \"That's pretty unusual in an incumbent primary. Sure enough, in late January, the Bell campaign reported raising $600,000. Bush, on the other hand, has about $215,000 cash on hand.\n\nDonning a \"Ceasefire Now\" t-shirt in front of a standing room-only crowd at her campaign launch event in late January Bush said she expected millions of dollars to be spent against her. \"What we've heard is anywhere between $2 million to $20 million right here in this race,\" she said, accusing national groups like AIPAC of trying to \"buy\" her seat.\n\nWhile her position on Israel may have created opportunities for her challenger, Bush's history as an organizer and her ties to St. Louis' activist community buoy her supporters. \"It's going to be a race of money versus people power,\" says Tamari. \"And I'm always going to bet on the people.\"\n\nTop art source photos by: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, Inc./Getty; Michael B.

      "text": "The Big Money Push to Oust Cori Bush\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty\n\nOn her 48th birthday, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) celebrated by campaigning. Yes, there was cake, and there was singing, and there was a DJ, but there was also-a little under three weeks out from a heated Democratic primary -canvassing in the sweltering heat.\n\nThe primary has been cast as another test of how the Democrat Party responds to Israel's war on Gaza. Bush, a member of the Squad , has been among the loudest voices calling for America to push harder for a ceasefire. United Democracy Project-a super-PAC affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee-has spent more than $7 million against Bush. The MO-01 race is already the fifth-most-expensive House primary in US history .\n\nLate last year, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell dropped out of his bid to dethrone Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri to challenge Bush. Some speculated he was recruited by AIPAC. A recently leaked phone call between Bush and Bell published by Drop Site News shows Bell promising he would not run against her: \"I'm telling you on my word I am not running against you. That is not happening,\" Bell is reported to have said. Four months later, he changed his mind.\n\nDespite both coming of age as politicians during Ferguson-and despite the fact that in their campaign literature, both candidates label themselves the \"real progressive\" here-Bell's challenge is firmly from the center . \"He's going to run as a Biden Democrat...as a Democratic team player,\" Missouri Independent columnist Jeff Smith, a former state senator who used to represent parts of Bush's district, told us in early 2024. \"There's a constituency for that, in particular among older voters, white and Black.\"\n\nAfter the defeat of Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) by an AIPAC-funded challenger in New York, many are worried. Will Bush be the latest member of the Squad to lose? The race is shaping up to define how Democrats deal with both post-Ferguson politics and members vocal against the party's mostly uncritical support of Israel.\n\nBush's political career was born in the streets of Ferguson, fighting against police brutality. Her staunch advocacy for a ceasefire, years later, brings those same values beyond US borders. \"St. Louis is my priority, but the world is also on my back, and in my head and in my heart,\" Bush said at a rally. Those values carried her to an easy reelection in 2020. But now, as the party drifts back to the right, she might be punished for them.\n\nOn the muggy late-July afternoon when Bush gathered supporters, friends, and family members in a park pavilion decorated in her signature purple for her birthday, guests buzzed over the news that, only hours earlier, President Joe Biden had dropped his bid for reelection.\n\n\"Today was a gift to us,\" Alderwoman Alisha Sonnier, a friend of Bush's from her Ferguson days, told the crowd.\n\nEarlier that week, Bush had told reporters that most calls to her office lately were requests for Biden to step down. While Bush herself didn't join the chorus of voices calling for Biden to go, she didn't push for the president to stay in the race as loudly as other Congress members either. \"Of course, her opponent jumped on that, and said this was an example of her being anti-Democratic,\" Sonnier said.\n\n\"Cori Bush is desperate to talk about anything other than how she has failed the people of Missouri's 1st congressional district,\" Jordan Sanders, Bell's campaign manager, told me in late June. \"Wesley will continue talking with voters about why St. Louis needs a progressive champion who will work with, not against, President Biden on delivering his agenda.\"\n\nThis line has been typical of the attacks on Bush. Bell has campaigned not only against her stance on Gaza but also asserted that her constituent services are lacking, that she hasn't passed enough bills, and that she hasn't been willing to work with Biden. AIPAC-funded ads have made similar points. (This is the usual state of play; the group does not often fund ads that are attacks on a candidate's policies on Israel. Instead, it helps the challenger win on other issues.)\n\nThe money could be working. In February, a poll released by the blog Missouri Scout , in collaboration with Republican polling firm Remington Research, showed Bush trailing Bell by 22 points. But people on the ground are not confident that the race for Missouri's 1st District is a foregone conclusion. President of the Board of Aldermen Megan Green told me the Remington Research poll is not indicative of Bush's support on the ground-because the group has been under-polling progressives for years. \"That same poll has had me far behind, when I ended up winning by 12 points against my opponent,\" she said.\n\nOther polls have shown a tighter race. Democratic Majority for Israel, an AIPAC-affiliated group, has run multiple surveys since Remington's. Both polls show Bell and Bush close, with Bell in the lead. The latest DMFI poll, which sampled 400 residents-but did not provide details about its methodology-finds Bell with a six-point edge over Bush.\n\n\"It's not a shoe-in, and it's really hard to predict,\" longtime Jennings city Council member Terry Wilson puts it. \"But [if] anybody was to beat [Bush], I'd say he had a pretty good shot at it.\"\n\nBell and Bush both found political careers in the aftermath of the Ferguson uprising, a protest movement that began 10 years ago this August when white police officer Darren Wilson killed unarmed Black teenager Mike Brown. Bush's district contains just under half of Missouri's entire Black population. The legacy of Ferguson has played a large part in influencing the outcome of mayoral, prosecutorial, and congressional races for the past decade here.\n\nIn 2018, Bell, previously a Ferguson City Council member, ran for St. Louis county prosecutor on the promise of overturning unjust convictions and perhaps reopening the case against Wilson. He won. But just like his conservative predecessor, he did not charge Wilson .\n\nBush took a different path to elected office. She was a protest stalwart back in Ferguson in 2014-showing up in the streets again and again as subsequent waves of anti-police-brutality protests bubbled over the next six years. She positioned herself as a community organizer, calling herself a \"politivist\"-a slightly hard-to-grasp portmanteau of politician and activist. In 2020, she defeated William Lacy Clay, a part of the 52-year Clay family congressional dynasty .\n\nThis has earned her trust. Mike Brown's family recently appeared in a Bush campaign advertisement to differentiate her activism from her opponent's: \"Wesley Bell...used my family for power, and now he's trying to sell out St. Louis,\" Michael Brown Sr. tells the camera.\n\nTwo weeks from today is the 10th anniversary of Michael Brown's death. His family deserves accountability for his killing. We fought for it. They were promised it. And that promise was broken. His still grieving family deserves this platform to share their story. pic.twitter.com/6pOxXT58L7\n\nAnd rapper Tef Poe released a diss track laying out what he sees as a betrayal by Bell, over the beat of Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us.\"\n\n\"Can't even walk through the Loop / you a sellout to the Lou,\" the former Ferguson activist says, referencing the downtown area in St. Louis. \"Shoulda reopened that case, but you a disgrace and ain't even tried.\"\n\nSince her election to Congress in 2021, Bush has become one of the most outspoken members on the left, pushing for an eviction moratorium and the restoration of abortion rights.\n\nIn 2022, she won 70 percent of the vote . Since then, she has upped her finances and has received some celebrity donors. Kyrie Irving-a sometimes controversial basketball star who does not ordinarily involve himself in congressional races-donated the maximum legal amount to her campaign, according to FEC records. (Irving's management did not respond to requests for comment.) Fellow Squad members Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) have come to Missouri to campaign for her. In total, Bush has raised about $2.6 million for her campaign.\n\nThat's surpassed by Bell, who has taken out more than $12 million in ads . \"I can't turn on the TV without every commercial break being like three or four Wesley Bell ads or the same ad over and over again,\" Green, the alderman, said.\n\nBut the money has courted controversy. As HuffPost reported in May, Bell has taken more than $65,000 from donors who also give to Missouri Republicans.\n\nSome Missouri progressive groups can't shake their concern that these donors will influence his policy positions. Abortion Action Missouri recently endorsed Bush, though they've endorsed Bell in previous races, and have no qualms with his record as a prosecutor around abortion.\n\nMallory Schwarz, the advocacy group's executive director, said the group is \"unsettled by what we have heard about some of the anti-abortion megadonors who have jumped into this race, and we question-what is their personal interest in weighing in, in our state and in our city?\" Planned Parenthood of Missouri has also thrown its weight behind Bush in this contest, though they've endorsed Bell before. (On the two-year anniversary of the Dobbs decision, Bell tweeted that he had been endorsed by Planned Parenthood; he then quickly revised that tweet to reflect that he didn't mean this race, but rather previous races he had run.)\n\nOn an organizing call in early June, Bush laid out how she sees the terms of this race to a small Zoom room. \"My opponent was running against Josh Hawley, and now he takes money from Josh Hawley's donors,\" she said. \"This is who we get if I am unseated-we get someone who goes whichever way the wind blows. We become unsafe when the people that only care about the money are the ones that take power.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Disingenuous Attack That Progressives Voted Against the Infrastructure Bill\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) questions witnesses during a roundtable discussion on Supreme Court ethics on June 11, 2024. Jemal Countess/Getty/Court Accountability\n\nIn June, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) lost to George Latimer in the most expensive primary in the history of the House of Representatives. Latimer was backed extensively by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). While many factors-like a recent redistricting-affected the race, the contest was viewed widely as an indication of the power of AIPAC to help oust progressives. (Bowman had, notably, called Israel's campaign in Gaza a genocide .)\n\nBut to say Bowman lost because of his views on Israel misses the way money works. AIPAC and other ads targeted Bowman on a myriad of issues. A key talking point, repeated consistently, was that Bowman did not vote for President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill. \"Jamaal Bowman has his own agenda,\" explained one $2.8 million spot , \"and refuses to compromise with President Biden.\"\n\nIn this election cycle, the attack has become a common theme. AIPAC and its subsidiary the United Democracy Project (UDP) have targeted progressive members of Congress who have vocally opposed Israel's 10-month war in Gaza. But their line of attack has often not been about foreign policy but, instead, that the leftists did not toe the Democratic line.\n\nTomorrow, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) will go up against St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, who entered the race almost immediately after Bush called for a ceasefire in Gaza-and, in doing so, has accessed massive ad funding from those same PACs that funded Latimer.\n\nThe same dynamic is at play in the race: Bell's ads have repeatedly said Bush did not vote for the infrastructure bill.\n\nThat's true-but also misses key context.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $1.2 trillion in federal spending to modernize America's roads and bridges, among other things. It was a landmark achievement. But it came as a compromise-excluding provisions around human infrastructure needs, like child care. Bush had fought for the wider agenda as part of Biden's original goal to Build Back Better.\n\nWhen Build Back Better was first introduced, it was budgeted at about $3.5 trillion . The House passed a version of the bill, only to be thwarted by Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), who at the time had de facto veto power. Eventually, through a lot of negotiations (and exhausting back and forth), Biden and Congress passed two bills: the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 .\n\nDuring that process, to push for as many components of Build Back Better as possible, members of the progressive caucus withheld their votes from the infrastructure bill.\n\nBush and Bowman, alongside three other progressives, kept pushing to pass a fuller version that would give families a $3,600 annual Child Tax Credit, establish a guaranteed free pre-K program, increase housing investments, supply tax-funded elder care, incentivize green energy development, and expand Medicare and Medicaid. At the time, Bush said this more robust plan would have benefited low-income residents of her district, and people like herself-a Black single mother who spent time living in her car.\n\n\"St. Louis deserves the president's entire agenda,\" Bush said at the time . \"So that means both the bipartisan infrastructure package and the Build Back Better Act.\" The Build Back Better Act included $1.75 trillion in child care and climate readiness investment; the infrastructure package did not. (Some elements of Build Back Better did make it into the Inflation Reduction Act .)\n\nBush's position that both bills needed to pass was not particularly radical. Joe Biden himself initially said that: \"If this is the only one that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem.\"\n\nEveryone seemed to understand the dynamics at play in the aftermath. Bush handily won reelection in 2022 with about 70 percent of the vote in her district. Her \"no\" vote on the infrastructure bill was not brought up as loudly at any point during that election. Now, though, it's near-impossible to turn on the television in Bush's district without seeing a portrayal of Bush as anti-union, anti-infrastructure, anti-St. Louis.\n\n\"What I find really disheartening about that is, before she took that vote, she did a district Zoom meeting,\" Megan Green, president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen and a staunch Bush supporter, remembers. \"There were labor leaders on the call, there were a lot of elected officials on the call, and she said, I just want to talk through what we're doing and why I'm taking this vote this way.\"\n\n\"To kind of turn around and use that against her is really disappointing,\" Green continued.\n\nLatimer's campaign-well-subsidized by PACs like AIPAC and Fairshake , a cryptocurrency lobby group-deployed that same playbook earlier this summer.\n\nLike Bell in his race against Bush, Latimer's campaign dug up Bowman's \"no\" vote on the infrastructure bill and presented him as an incorrigible obstructionist. But that's not an accurate account of what happened back in 2021, as Bowman explained at the time .\n\n\"While one is the hard infrastructure bill-roads, bridges, tunnels and construction jobs; great, we need that. We also need child care. We also need universal pre-K. We need to lower drug prices. We need paid family leave,\" Bowman said. \"The plan was to pass both together, and when we decided not to do that, I decided to vote no on that bill.\"\n\nLatimer defeated Bowman by 17 percentage points.\n\nDon Samuels, who will be up against Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in an August 13 primary, is using a note-for-note identical strategy in his first advertisement of the campaign.\n\nIt has been three years since the infrastructure bill vote, and the Build Back Better Act still hasn't been passed.\n\nBowman lost, and Bush, tomorrow, runs the risk of being ousted too .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "This Black Lives Matter Activist Is Running for Congress. Can She Bring Down a 20-Year Incumbent?\n\nCori Bush, left, is challenging Lacy Clay, a 10-term member of Congress, in Tuesday's Missouri Democratic primary. Mother Jones illustration; Jeff Roberson/AP; Bill Clark/Getty\n\nCori Bush smells tear gas when there isn't any. Loud noises frighten her, reminders of police brandishing sniper rifles, firing rubber bullets, and revving the engines of armored vehicles. When the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck began to circulate, Bush's reaction was instinctual: \"Don't look at it.\" She looked anyway.\n\nFor 400 days in 2014 and 2015, protesters gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, to register their outrage over the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown. For most of those days, Bush joined them-at first, in her capacity as a registered nurse to tend to protesters' injuries, and later as a community organizer on the front lines. She went out again in 2017 to organize after another white police officer was acquitted of murder in the 2011 shooting death of a Black man during a car chase in north St. Louis. This year, as Americans across the country protested Floyd's killing, a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant-Bush's hometown- ran over a Black man with his unmarked SUV before getting out of the car to repeatedly kick him. And so Bush and her fellow Ferguson activists organized yet another demonstration against police brutality. During a June gathering, she tweeted that she had been pepper-sprayed in the eyes by the cops.\n\n\"It's a reminder that we didn't finish the work,\" Bush, 43, tells me.\n\nAfter Brown's killing, Ferguson voters replaced several members of the city council, which now, like Ferguson itself, is majority Black. The city swore in its first Black police chief in 2016, and, two years later, the much-criticized county prosecutor who oversaw the investigation into Brown's killing lost his seat in a primary. But for all the headway they've made at home, Ferguson activists have had little ability to rewrite the country's broken criminal justice policies. \"There's only so much you can do when you don't have that pen in your hand,\" Bush says.\n\nHalf a decade after the Ferguson protests, Bush is in the final days of her second primary challenge against Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who has held the St. Louis-area 1st congressional district since 2001. The race features two Black leaders with very different ideas about how to create change. Clay is a consummate insider who has spent decades building political power, which he has used to secure tangible, if incremental, progress on issues including police abuse. Bush, who is also an ordained minister, has little patience for incremental measures. She believes the district that helped turn Black Lives Matter into a national movement should have an activist in its congressional seat, someone who stands unwaveringly with BLM's demands.\n\nBush began her career as a preschool teacher making minimum wage. After a decade with the same company, she'd worked her way up to become the school's assistant director-but she still made only $9 per hour. She quit that job in 2001, when she became ill while pregnant with her second child. Not long after giving birth, she and her then-husband were evicted from the home they'd been renting. For several months, they lived out of the family's Ford Explorer with their 14-month-old son and newborn daughter.\n\nWhen her children were small, Bush got stuck in a cycle of debt with predatory personal loans. She borrowed small amounts-$250 here, $500 there-to cover rent, utility bills, and car repairs. \"I remember one day I was sitting outside of the PayDay Loan office...I just remember thinking like, 'Who speaks up for people like me?'\" Bush recalls. \"Why do I keep having to live like this?\"\n\nSo for Bush, her crusade for office is personal. She supports Medicare for All because she gave up her employer-sponsored health insurance to run for office-and has to pay out of pocket for two hospitalizations for a suspected case of COVID-19. She supports tuition-free college because she had to pay off student loans. And she supports a $15 minimum wage because she made far less than that for so long. \"I've struggled paycheck to paycheck, asking, 'Where's our progress?'\" Bush narrates in her first television ad . \"As a Black mom, I'm sick of having to say, 'Just make it home safely.'\"\n\nThe thing is...Clay supports these things, too. He's been a cosponsor of Medicare for All since former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) first introduced it in 2003. He sided with progressives by voting against Trump's replacement for NAFTA. He cosponsored the Green New Deal. In the most recent session of Congress, he signed onto Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) bill that would cap credit card interest rates at 15 percent-a limit that some of his more moderate colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee found preposterously low.\n\nThen there's criminal justice. Two months before the 2014 Ferguson uprising, Clay had joined a majority of Democrats in voting against a measure that would have ended the transfer of military equipment to police. But in the days that followed Brown's death, he co-authored a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder demanding the Justice Department investigate the shooting and any patterns of police misconduct. The DOJ did investigate , ultimately clearing the officer who killed Brown but issuing a damning report that determined Ferguson police were routinely \"stopping people without reasonable suspicion, arresting them without probable cause, and using unreasonable force against them.\" The St. Louis American , the local Black newspaper, endorsed Clay's reelection bid in 2018, observing that his \"insider game in Washington\" had helped bring about the probe, which ultimately resulted in a consent decree under which the city agreed to legally binding reforms. \"St. Louis will be better served by having an experienced congressman with nearly two decades of seniority,\" the paper concluded.\n\nThis year, while Bush was protesting Floyd's murder, Clay and many of his colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus were shaping the Democrats' landmark police reform legislation. The measure stops short of activists' demands to \"defund the police,\" but it would establish a national registry of police misconduct, end qualified immunity-which prevents citizens from suing individual officers-and ban chokeholds. Clay's contributions to the bill would mandate deescalation training for officers, require that deadly force only be employed as a last resort, and provide for the appointment of an independent prosecutor anytime deadly force is used. The bill passed the House on June 25, exactly one month after Floyd died.\n\n\"It is the role of an activist to push us as far as they can push us. It is our role to legislate, and that is a different role,\" CBC chair Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.)-herself a longtime civil rights activist- told Politico in June, as the bill was working its way through the House. \"We are very committed to making a difference, and that is different than making a point. You can either make a point, or you can make a difference.\"\n\nBush's run against Clay doesn't neatly follow the pattern of successful progressive primary challenges, which have lately excelled on two planes. One is ideology: Former marketing executive Marie Newman defeated Rep. Dan Lipinski (Ill.) this past March on the premise that no sitting House Democrat should oppose abortion rights. Another is representation: Two years ago, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) unseated Rep. Michael Capuano, a bona fide progressive, by arguing in part that her life experience would help her better serve her majority-minority district. Jamaal Bowman's recent win against New York Rep. Eliot Engel succeeded on both fronts-as did Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 victory over House Democratic caucus chair Joseph Crowley.\n\nBush is challenging Clay on a third dimension: The rigor with which he fights for his constituents. As an example, she points to the House's police bill. \"I think they're too soft,\" she says of its provisions, criticizing the lack of any \"real 'defund' language.\" Bush has also slammed Clay's coziness with corporate interests. Three-quarters of the nearly $750,000 Clay raised through June of this year came from political action committees, nearly 80 percent of which are backed by big business. His top campaign contributor is Quicken Loans, a mortgage giant that Clay is charged with overseeing from his perch on the Financial Services Committee. In 2015, the Justice Department sued Quicken for originating hundreds of home loans for borrowers who weren't eligible for them. (The company agreed to pay $32.5 million to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.)\n\nClay maintains that his fundraising has no bearing on how he votes. But Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive group, placed a six-figure television ad buy to revisit an episode in which Clay sided with financial services companies to fight against a rule that would force investment advisers to act in their clients' best interests. (The rule took effect, but a GOP-appointed judge later gutted it, and Clay has since joined other Democrats in calling for its reinstatement.)\n\n\"It doesn't always align perfectly with a vote-often, stagnation is in return for a corporate donation,\" says Morgan Harper, a former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adviser who recently waged an unsuccessful primary challenge against Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) and now advises Fight Corporate Monopolies. \"We need someone who is fighting for progressive policies that make sure the economy is working for everyone-with the maximum level of aggression that's possible.\"\n\nThe CBC counts some of Congress' most progressive lawmakers among its members, including Pressley and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who regularly oppose the positions of Democratic congressional leaders. But many CBC members align closely with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and are staunch defenders of institutional norms like seniority. Few so closely embody that guiding principle as Clay, who won his seat upon the retirement of his father, a civil rights activist and founding member of the CBC who served in Congress for 32 years. Between the two of them, a Clay has represented the district for more than half a century.\n\nCBC allies view that longevity as an asset. \"Seniority has played an important role in the rise of the CBC,\" a source close to Clay says. \"The reality is that elevating those CBC members who have been there for 10 or 20 or 30 years has played a key part in the CBC's ability to gain chairmanships and leadership roles and become as powerful as it is today.\"\n\nBush sees things differently. \"If that seniority is not benefiting the people directly anymore, then it's time to retire,\" she tells me.\n\nIn recent cycles, the CBC's political action committee has supported some long-serving white incumbents over their Black opponents-it backed Capuano and Engel , for instance-and its members generally do not take kindly to primary challenges. This cycle, Justice Democrats, which played a role in Ocasio-Cortez's and Pressley's 2018 victories, endorsed challengers against two CBC members: Clay and Beatty. Some members of the CBC were livid . Clay told The Hill that Justice Democrats' actions were \"a bunch of B.S.\" and \"insulting\" to his constituents, likening their attempts to \"devastate the party\" to the \"Russian trolls of 2016.\"\n\n\"They want to come back again this year?\" he told the Washington Post, referring to the progressive groups supporting Bush's second attempt to oust him. \"That's fine. I'm going to kick their [posterior] again, okay?\"\n\nClay defeated Bush by nearly 20 points in 2018, but he's nevertheless taking this year's primary seriously, launching a series of sharply negative attacks in the final days of the race. His campaign circulated a mailer that notes Bush failed to pay taxes four times in recent years, that she's been evicted three times, and that her nursing license was suspended. In essence, the fusilade amounts to criticism of Bush for being poor. Bush's campaign says her license was suspended because she couldn't afford to pay her taxes, and she'd been evicted because she couldn't afford her rent. The Clay campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThose attacks may have less efficacy than Clay imagines in this political moment, when Americans are attuned to the legacies of systemic racism more than ever before. And a sea of new donors have appeared on Bush's side: She raised $170,000 in June as nationwide protests raged, an amount that accounts for nearly a third of all the money she's brought in this cycle. She received an endorsement from Bernie Sanders, for whom she served as a national surrogate, as well as from the recently victorious Bowman.\n\nNotably absent from this growing list of supporters is Ocasio-Cortez, who hasn't weighed in on the race this time around. But Justice Democrats is giving Bush more financial support than it did last cycle: In addition to the $40,000 the group helped her raise, its independent expenditure is now running a TV ad on her behalf.\n\nBush thinks the momentum is on her side. \"Because of the work that we did [in Ferguson in 2014], such a foundation was laid to where some of this is easier for people-so more people have been activated,\" she says. \"Now people are looking for those candidates. They're like, 'Okay, you've been actually doing this work.' That has been a huge boost to our campaign.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "One of the Most Vocal Proponents of a Ceasefire in Gaza Just Lost\n\nCori Bush is the second progressive Congress member to lose her seat after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Mother Jones; Sue Dorfman/ZUMA\n\nIn one of the most watched primaries this year, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.)-among the first members of Congress to call for a ceasefire-lost to St. Louis Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, who jumped into the race late, and with the backing of millions of dollars from pro-Israel groups . The Associated Press called the race for Bell around 10:00 PM local time.\n\n\"Organized people beat organized money,\" Bush's campaigners have repeated. This race, however, has tested whether that's true: as of election day, it is the second-most expensive Congressional primary in American history-and the money has, indeed, made a difference.\n\nBell dropped out of his bid to dethrone Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and chose to challenge Bush soon after the war began in Gaza. Bell has benefited from an incredibly well-funded advertising campaign since then.\n\nOver half of all the outside money spent on the race came from the United Democracy Project (UDP), the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)'s electoral arm. The money UDP spent here is second only to that which they spent on a successful campaign to defeat Rep. Jamaal Bowman in New York. In total, UDP spent nearly 9 million dollars in MO-01, bolstered by $1.5 million from the crypto PAC Fairshake. Bush and her backers also attracted some outside spending: Justice Democrats, a progressive PAC founded by former campaigners for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent $2 million her way.\n\nBell's choice to take that money has been divisive. Mike Jones, a 75-year-old former alderman and Board of Education member with a long career in St. Louis politics put it this way: \"I think everybody knows that the race is not about the issues that have surfaced. It's about the issue nobody's talking about.\" On most issues, Bell and Bush's stances are near-identical. \"So, literally, the only reason for this campaign, at a political level, is AIPAC money,\" Jones said.\n\nOver a quarter of children in the district live in poverty, per the latest census numbers. Schools in the City of St. Louis are so underfunded that the district may not have a full fleet of school bus drivers this year . Healthcare access in the district remains limited, particularly for Black women -and abortion, which both candidates hope to restore, remains illegal in the state.\n\nBut the millions brought into the district for this campaign by outside groups on both sides of the election are not doing much to address those issues. Instead, they're flooding people's mailboxes with fliers, often several per day, about Bush not backing Biden, as I previously reported .\n\nThe campaign became vitriolic in its final weeks. Each candidate has dealt with leaked, compromising audio recordings: Bell swearing he wouldn't run against Bush, only to renege on that promise; Bush comparing the DOJ investigation over her office's money-management practices to the FBI spying on Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe youth voter-engagement group Protect Our Power has been on the ground in St. Louis for the past month knocking on doors. Many of those canvassing are the same young campaigners who powered Jamaal Bowman's reelection campaign in New York, only to witness his defeat.  Ella Weber, 22, was one of those campaigners said she and her Protect Our Power co-campaigners \"went on a long walk\" that night \"and just like, talked about how important it was that we don't retreat.\" So they moved on quickly to the next \"Squad\" race to try again. They crashed on couches and canvassed for a month in St. Louis, working what Weber described as \"70-hour weeks\" for free. As they canvassed, though, they were up against a well-run and well-funded campaign on the other side.\n\n\"I think few times in my political experience have I seen it so clearly that voters are watching a lot of ads,\" said Denae Ávila-Dickson of Sunrise Movement.\n\n\"I think people power is still putting up a really, really strong fight against this historic funding,\" she told Mother Jones about 5 hours before the polls closed. \"But I think the reality is that our election systems aren't equipped to deal with the scale of spending that is in this race.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Activist Cori Bush Defeats Corporate-Backed Democratic Congress Member\n\nCori Bush Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty\n\nIn a stunning upset, Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush has defeated 10-term incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in the Democratic primary for Missouri's 1st Congressional District, according to the Associated Press . Bush, a minister and registered nurse, has been heavily involved in protests against police violence since the 2014 Ferguson protests. Mother Jones ' Kara Voght wrote about the race last week:\n\nFor 400 days in 2014 and 2015, protesters gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, to register their outrage over the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown. For most of those days, Bush joined them-at first, in her capacity as a registered nurse to tend to protesters' injuries, and later as a community organizer on the front lines. She went out again in 2017 to organize after another white police officer was acquitted of murder in the 2011 shooting death of a Black man during a car chase in north St. Louis. This year, as Americans across the country protested Floyd's killing, a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant-Bush's hometown- ran over a Black man with his unmarked SUV before getting out of the car to repeatedly kick him. And so Bush and her fellow Ferguson activists organized yet another demonstration against police brutality. During a June gathering, she tweeted that she had been pepper-sprayed in the eyes by the cops.\n\n[...]\n\nThe race features two Black leaders with very different ideas about how to create change. Clay is a consummate insider who has spent decades building political power, which he has used to secure tangible, if incremental, progress on issues including police abuse. Bush, who is also an ordained minister, has little patience for incremental measures. She believes the district that helped turn Black Lives Matter into a national movement should have an activist in its congressional seat, someone who stands unwaveringly with BLM's demands.\n\n[...]\n\nBush has also slammed Clay's coziness with corporate interests. Three-quarters of the nearly $750,000 Clay raised through June of this year came from political action committees, nearly 80 percent of which are backed by big business. His top campaign contributor is Quicken Loans, a mortgage giant that Clay is charged with overseeing from his perch on the Financial Services Committee. In 2015, the Justice Department sued Quicken for originating hundreds of home loans for borrowers who weren't eligible for them. (The company agreed to pay $32.5 million to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.)\n\nClay maintains that his fundraising has no bearing on how he votes. But Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive group, placed a six-figure television ad buy to revisit an episode in which Clay sided with financial services companies to fight against a rule that would force investment advisers to act in their clients' best interests.\n\nYou can read the full story here .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Disingenuous Attack That Progressives Voted Against the Infrastructure Bill\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) questions witnesses during a roundtable discussion on Supreme Court ethics on June 11, 2024. Jemal Countess/Getty/Court Accountability\n\nIn June, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) lost to George Latimer in the most expensive primary in the history of the House of Representatives. Latimer was backed extensively by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). While many factors-like a recent redistricting-affected the race, the contest was viewed widely as an indication of the power of AIPAC to help oust progressives. (Bowman had, notably, called Israel's campaign in Gaza a genocide .)\n\nBut to say Bowman lost because of his views on Israel misses the way money works. AIPAC and other ads targeted Bowman on a myriad of issues. A key talking point, repeated consistently, was that Bowman did not vote for President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill. \"Jamaal Bowman has his own agenda,\" explained one $2.8 million spot , \"and refuses to compromise with President Biden.\"\n\nIn this election cycle, the attack has become a common theme. AIPAC and its subsidiary the United Democracy Project (UDP) have targeted progressive members of Congress who have vocally opposed Israel's 10-month war in Gaza. But their line of attack has often not been about foreign policy but, instead, that the leftists did not toe the Democratic line.\n\nTomorrow, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) will go up against St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, who entered the race almost immediately after Bush called for a ceasefire in Gaza-and, in doing so, has accessed massive ad funding from those same PACs that funded Latimer.\n\nThe same dynamic is at play in the race: Bell's ads have repeatedly said Bush did not vote for the infrastructure bill.\n\nThat's true-but also misses key context.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $1.2 trillion in federal spending to modernize America's roads and bridges, among other things. It was a landmark achievement. But it came as a compromise-excluding provisions around human infrastructure needs, like child care. Bush had fought for the wider agenda as part of Biden's original goal to Build Back Better.\n\nWhen Build Back Better was first introduced, it was budgeted at about $3.5 trillion . The House passed a version of the bill, only to be thwarted by Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), who at the time had de facto veto power. Eventually, through a lot of negotiations (and exhausting back and forth), Biden and Congress passed two bills: the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 .\n\nDuring that process, to push for as many components of Build Back Better as possible, members of the progressive caucus withheld their votes from the infrastructure bill.\n\nBush and Bowman, alongside three other progressives, kept pushing to pass a fuller version that would give families a $3,600 annual Child Tax Credit, establish a guaranteed free pre-K program, increase housing investments, supply tax-funded elder care, incentivize green energy development, and expand Medicare and Medicaid. At the time, Bush said this more robust plan would have benefited low-income residents of her district, and people like herself-a Black single mother who spent time living in her car.\n\n\"St. Louis deserves the president's entire agenda,\" Bush said at the time . \"So that means both the bipartisan infrastructure package and the Build Back Better Act.\" The Build Back Better Act included $1.75 trillion in child care and climate readiness investment; the infrastructure package did not. (Some elements of Build Back Better did make it into the Inflation Reduction Act .)\n\nBush's position that both bills needed to pass was not particularly radical. Joe Biden himself initially said that: \"If this is the only one that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem.\"\n\nEveryone seemed to understand the dynamics at play in the aftermath. Bush handily won reelection in 2022 with about 70 percent of the vote in her district. Her \"no\" vote on the infrastructure bill was not brought up as loudly at any point during that election. Now, though, it's near-impossible to turn on the television in Bush's district without seeing a portrayal of Bush as anti-union, anti-infrastructure, anti-St. Louis.\n\n\"What I find really disheartening about that is, before she took that vote, she did a district Zoom meeting,\" Megan Green, president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen and a staunch Bush supporter, remembers. \"There were labor leaders on the call, there were a lot of elected officials on the call, and she said, I just want to talk through what we're doing and why I'm taking this vote this way.\"\n\n\"To kind of turn around and use that against her is really disappointing,\" Green continued.\n\nLatimer's campaign-well-subsidized by PACs like AIPAC and Fairshake , a cryptocurrency lobby group-deployed that same playbook earlier this summer.\n\nLike Bell in his race against Bush, Latimer's campaign dug up Bowman's \"no\" vote on the infrastructure bill and presented him as an incorrigible obstructionist. But that's not an accurate account of what happened back in 2021, as Bowman explained at the time .\n\n\"While one is the hard infrastructure bill-roads, bridges, tunnels and construction jobs; great, we need that. We also need child care. We also need universal pre-K. We need to lower drug prices. We need paid family leave,\" Bowman said. \"The plan was to pass both together, and when we decided not to do that, I decided to vote no on that bill.\"\n\nLatimer defeated Bowman by 17 percentage points.\n\nDon Samuels, who will be up against Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in an August 13 primary, is using a note-for-note identical strategy in his first advertisement of the campaign.\n\nIt has been three years since the infrastructure bill vote, and the Build Back Better Act still hasn't been passed.\n\nBowman lost, and Bush, tomorrow, runs the risk of being ousted too .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Disingenuous Attack That Progressives Voted Against the Infrastructure Bill\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) questions witnesses during a roundtable discussion on Supreme Court ethics on June 11, 2024. Jemal Countess/Getty/Court Accountability\n\nIn June, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) lost to George Latimer in the most expensive primary in the history of the House of Representatives. Latimer was backed extensively by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). While many factors-like a recent redistricting-affected the race, the contest was viewed widely as an indication of the power of AIPAC to help oust progressives. (Bowman had, notably, called Israel's campaign in Gaza a genocide .)\n\nBut to say Bowman lost because of his views on Israel misses the way money works. AIPAC and other ads targeted Bowman on a myriad of issues. A key talking point, repeated consistently, was that Bowman did not vote for President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill. \"Jamaal Bowman has his own agenda,\" explained one $2.8 million spot , \"and refuses to compromise with President Biden.\"\n\nIn this election cycle, the attack has become a common theme. AIPAC and its subsidiary the United Democracy Project (UDP) have targeted progressive members of Congress who have vocally opposed Israel's 10-month war in Gaza. But their line of attack has often not been about foreign policy but, instead, that the leftists did not toe the Democratic line.\n\nTomorrow, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) will go up against St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, who entered the race almost immediately after Bush called for a ceasefire in Gaza-and, in doing so, has accessed massive ad funding from those same PACs that funded Latimer.\n\nThe same dynamic is at play in the race: Bell's ads have repeatedly said Bush did not vote for the infrastructure bill.\n\nThat's true-but also misses key context.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $1.2 trillion in federal spending to modernize America's roads and bridges, among other things. It was a landmark achievement. But it came as a compromise-excluding provisions around human infrastructure needs, like child care. Bush had fought for the wider agenda as part of Biden's original goal to Build Back Better.\n\nWhen Build Back Better was first introduced, it was budgeted at about $3.5 trillion . The House passed a version of the bill, only to be thwarted by Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), who at the time had de facto veto power. Eventually, through a lot of negotiations (and exhausting back and forth), Biden and Congress passed two bills: the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 .\n\nDuring that process, to push for as many components of Build Back Better as possible, members of the progressive caucus withheld their votes from the infrastructure bill.\n\nBush and Bowman, alongside three other progressives, kept pushing to pass a fuller version that would give families a $3,600 annual Child Tax Credit, establish a guaranteed free pre-K program, increase housing investments, supply tax-funded elder care, incentivize green energy development, and expand Medicare and Medicaid. At the time, Bush said this more robust plan would have benefited low-income residents of her district, and people like herself-a Black single mother who spent time living in her car.\n\n\"St. Louis deserves the president's entire agenda,\" Bush said at the time . \"So that means both the bipartisan infrastructure package and the Build Back Better Act.\" The Build Back Better Act included $1.75 trillion in child care and climate readiness investment; the infrastructure package did not. (Some elements of Build Back Better did make it into the Inflation Reduction Act .)\n\nBush's position that both bills needed to pass was not particularly radical. Joe Biden himself initially said that: \"If this is the only one that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem.\"\n\nEveryone seemed to understand the dynamics at play in the aftermath. Bush handily won reelection in 2022 with about 70 percent of the vote in her district. Her \"no\" vote on the infrastructure bill was not brought up as loudly at any point during that election. Now, though, it's near-impossible to turn on the television in Bush's district without seeing a portrayal of Bush as anti-union, anti-infrastructure, anti-St. Louis.\n\n\"What I find really disheartening about that is, before she took that vote, she did a district Zoom meeting,\" Megan Green, president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen and a staunch Bush supporter, remembers. \"There were labor leaders on the call, there were a lot of elected officials on the call, and she said, I just want to talk through what we're doing and why I'm taking this vote this way.\"\n\n\"To kind of turn around and use that against her is really disappointing,\" Green continued.\n\nLatimer's campaign-well-subsidized by PACs like AIPAC and Fairshake , a cryptocurrency lobby group-deployed that same playbook earlier this summer.\n\nLike Bell in his race against Bush, Latimer's campaign dug up Bowman's \"no\" vote on the infrastructure bill and presented him as an incorrigible obstructionist. But that's not an accurate account of what happened back in 2021, as Bowman explained at the time .\n\n\"While one is the hard infrastructure bill-roads, bridges, tunnels and construction jobs; great, we need that. We also need child care. We also need universal pre-K. We need to lower drug prices. We need paid family leave,\" Bowman said. \"The plan was to pass both together, and when we decided not to do that, I decided to vote no on that bill.\"\n\nLatimer defeated Bowman by 17 percentage points.\n\nDon Samuels, who will be up against Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in an August 13 primary, is using a note-for-note identical strategy in his first advertisement of the campaign.\n\nIt has been three years since the infrastructure bill vote, and the Build Back Better Act still hasn't been passed.\n\nBowman lost, and Bush, tomorrow, runs the risk of being ousted too .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "This Black Lives Matter Activist Is Running for Congress. Can She Bring Down a 20-Year Incumbent?\n\nCori Bush, left, is challenging Lacy Clay, a 10-term member of Congress, in Tuesday's Missouri Democratic primary. Mother Jones illustration; Jeff Roberson/AP; Bill Clark/Getty\n\nCori Bush smells tear gas when there isn't any. Loud noises frighten her, reminders of police brandishing sniper rifles, firing rubber bullets, and revving the engines of armored vehicles. When the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck began to circulate, Bush's reaction was instinctual: \"Don't look at it.\" She looked anyway.\n\nFor 400 days in 2014 and 2015, protesters gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, to register their outrage over the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown. For most of those days, Bush joined them-at first, in her capacity as a registered nurse to tend to protesters' injuries, and later as a community organizer on the front lines. She went out again in 2017 to organize after another white police officer was acquitted of murder in the 2011 shooting death of a Black man during a car chase in north St. Louis. This year, as Americans across the country protested Floyd's killing, a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant-Bush's hometown- ran over a Black man with his unmarked SUV before getting out of the car to repeatedly kick him. And so Bush and her fellow Ferguson activists organized yet another demonstration against police brutality. During a June gathering, she tweeted that she had been pepper-sprayed in the eyes by the cops.\n\n\"It's a reminder that we didn't finish the work,\" Bush, 43, tells me.\n\nAfter Brown's killing, Ferguson voters replaced several members of the city council, which now, like Ferguson itself, is majority Black. The city swore in its first Black police chief in 2016, and, two years later, the much-criticized county prosecutor who oversaw the investigation into Brown's killing lost his seat in a primary. But for all the headway they've made at home, Ferguson activists have had little ability to rewrite the country's broken criminal justice policies. \"There's only so much you can do when you don't have that pen in your hand,\" Bush says.\n\nHalf a decade after the Ferguson protests, Bush is in the final days of her second primary challenge against Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who has held the St. Louis-area 1st congressional district since 2001. The race features two Black leaders with very different ideas about how to create change. Clay is a consummate insider who has spent decades building political power, which he has used to secure tangible, if incremental, progress on issues including police abuse. Bush, who is also an ordained minister, has little patience for incremental measures. She believes the district that helped turn Black Lives Matter into a national movement should have an activist in its congressional seat, someone who stands unwaveringly with BLM's demands.\n\nBush began her career as a preschool teacher making minimum wage. After a decade with the same company, she'd worked her way up to become the school's assistant director-but she still made only $9 per hour. She quit that job in 2001, when she became ill while pregnant with her second child. Not long after giving birth, she and her then-husband were evicted from the home they'd been renting. For several months, they lived out of the family's Ford Explorer with their 14-month-old son and newborn daughter.\n\nWhen her children were small, Bush got stuck in a cycle of debt with predatory personal loans. She borrowed small amounts-$250 here, $500 there-to cover rent, utility bills, and car repairs. \"I remember one day I was sitting outside of the PayDay Loan office...I just remember thinking like, 'Who speaks up for people like me?'\" Bush recalls. \"Why do I keep having to live like this?\"\n\nSo for Bush, her crusade for office is personal. She supports Medicare for All because she gave up her employer-sponsored health insurance to run for office-and has to pay out of pocket for two hospitalizations for a suspected case of COVID-19. She supports tuition-free college because she had to pay off student loans. And she supports a $15 minimum wage because she made far less than that for so long. \"I've struggled paycheck to paycheck, asking, 'Where's our progress?'\" Bush narrates in her first television ad . \"As a Black mom, I'm sick of having to say, 'Just make it home safely.'\"\n\nThe thing is...Clay supports these things, too. He's been a cosponsor of Medicare for All since former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) first introduced it in 2003. He sided with progressives by voting against Trump's replacement for NAFTA. He cosponsored the Green New Deal. In the most recent session of Congress, he signed onto Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) bill that would cap credit card interest rates at 15 percent-a limit that some of his more moderate colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee found preposterously low.\n\nThen there's criminal justice. Two months before the 2014 Ferguson uprising, Clay had joined a majority of Democrats in voting against a measure that would have ended the transfer of military equipment to police. But in the days that followed Brown's death, he co-authored a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder demanding the Justice Department investigate the shooting and any patterns of police misconduct. The DOJ did investigate , ultimately clearing the officer who killed Brown but issuing a damning report that determined Ferguson police were routinely \"stopping people without reasonable suspicion, arresting them without probable cause, and using unreasonable force against them.\" The St. Louis American , the local Black newspaper, endorsed Clay's reelection bid in 2018, observing that his \"insider game in Washington\" had helped bring about the probe, which ultimately resulted in a consent decree under which the city agreed to legally binding reforms. \"St. Louis will be better served by having an experienced congressman with nearly two decades of seniority,\" the paper concluded.\n\nThis year, while Bush was protesting Floyd's murder, Clay and many of his colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus were shaping the Democrats' landmark police reform legislation. The measure stops short of activists' demands to \"defund the police,\" but it would establish a national registry of police misconduct, end qualified immunity-which prevents citizens from suing individual officers-and ban chokeholds. Clay's contributions to the bill would mandate deescalation training for officers, require that deadly force only be employed as a last resort, and provide for the appointment of an independent prosecutor anytime deadly force is used. The bill passed the House on June 25, exactly one month after Floyd died.\n\n\"It is the role of an activist to push us as far as they can push us. It is our role to legislate, and that is a different role,\" CBC chair Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.)-herself a longtime civil rights activist- told Politico in June, as the bill was working its way through the House. \"We are very committed to making a difference, and that is different than making a point. You can either make a point, or you can make a difference.\"\n\nBush's run against Clay doesn't neatly follow the pattern of successful progressive primary challenges, which have lately excelled on two planes. One is ideology: Former marketing executive Marie Newman defeated Rep. Dan Lipinski (Ill.) this past March on the premise that no sitting House Democrat should oppose abortion rights. Another is representation: Two years ago, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) unseated Rep. Michael Capuano, a bona fide progressive, by arguing in part that her life experience would help her better serve her majority-minority district. Jamaal Bowman's recent win against New York Rep. Eliot Engel succeeded on both fronts-as did Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 victory over House Democratic caucus chair Joseph Crowley.\n\nBush is challenging Clay on a third dimension: The rigor with which he fights for his constituents. As an example, she points to the House's police bill. \"I think they're too soft,\" she says of its provisions, criticizing the lack of any \"real 'defund' language.\" Bush has also slammed Clay's coziness with corporate interests. Three-quarters of the nearly $750,000 Clay raised through June of this year came from political action committees, nearly 80 percent of which are backed by big business. His top campaign contributor is Quicken Loans, a mortgage giant that Clay is charged with overseeing from his perch on the Financial Services Committee. In 2015, the Justice Department sued Quicken for originating hundreds of home loans for borrowers who weren't eligible for them. (The company agreed to pay $32.5 million to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.)\n\nClay maintains that his fundraising has no bearing on how he votes. But Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive group, placed a six-figure television ad buy to revisit an episode in which Clay sided with financial services companies to fight against a rule that would force investment advisers to act in their clients' best interests. (The rule took effect, but a GOP-appointed judge later gutted it, and Clay has since joined other Democrats in calling for its reinstatement.)\n\n\"It doesn't always align perfectly with a vote-often, stagnation is in return for a corporate donation,\" says Morgan Harper, a former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adviser who recently waged an unsuccessful primary challenge against Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) and now advises Fight Corporate Monopolies. \"We need someone who is fighting for progressive policies that make sure the economy is working for everyone-with the maximum level of aggression that's possible.\"\n\nThe CBC counts some of Congress' most progressive lawmakers among its members, including Pressley and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who regularly oppose the positions of Democratic congressional leaders. But many CBC members align closely with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and are staunch defenders of institutional norms like seniority. Few so closely embody that guiding principle as Clay, who won his seat upon the retirement of his father, a civil rights activist and founding member of the CBC who served in Congress for 32 years. Between the two of them, a Clay has represented the district for more than half a century.\n\nCBC allies view that longevity as an asset. \"Seniority has played an important role in the rise of the CBC,\" a source close to Clay says. \"The reality is that elevating those CBC members who have been there for 10 or 20 or 30 years has played a key part in the CBC's ability to gain chairmanships and leadership roles and become as powerful as it is today.\"\n\nBush sees things differently. \"If that seniority is not benefiting the people directly anymore, then it's time to retire,\" she tells me.\n\nIn recent cycles, the CBC's political action committee has supported some long-serving white incumbents over their Black opponents-it backed Capuano and Engel , for instance-and its members generally do not take kindly to primary challenges. This cycle, Justice Democrats, which played a role in Ocasio-Cortez's and Pressley's 2018 victories, endorsed challengers against two CBC members: Clay and Beatty. Some members of the CBC were livid . Clay told The Hill that Justice Democrats' actions were \"a bunch of B.S.\" and \"insulting\" to his constituents, likening their attempts to \"devastate the party\" to the \"Russian trolls of 2016.\"\n\n\"They want to come back again this year?\" he told the Washington Post, referring to the progressive groups supporting Bush's second attempt to oust him. \"That's fine. I'm going to kick their [posterior] again, okay?\"\n\nClay defeated Bush by nearly 20 points in 2018, but he's nevertheless taking this year's primary seriously, launching a series of sharply negative attacks in the final days of the race. His campaign circulated a mailer that notes Bush failed to pay taxes four times in recent years, that she's been evicted three times, and that her nursing license was suspended. In essence, the fusilade amounts to criticism of Bush for being poor. Bush's campaign says her license was suspended because she couldn't afford to pay her taxes, and she'd been evicted because she couldn't afford her rent. The Clay campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThose attacks may have less efficacy than Clay imagines in this political moment, when Americans are attuned to the legacies of systemic racism more than ever before. And a sea of new donors have appeared on Bush's side: She raised $170,000 in June as nationwide protests raged, an amount that accounts for nearly a third of all the money she's brought in this cycle. She received an endorsement from Bernie Sanders, for whom she served as a national surrogate, as well as from the recently victorious Bowman.\n\nNotably absent from this growing list of supporters is Ocasio-Cortez, who hasn't weighed in on the race this time around. But Justice Democrats is giving Bush more financial support than it did last cycle: In addition to the $40,000 the group helped her raise, its independent expenditure is now running a TV ad on her behalf.\n\nBush thinks the momentum is on her side. \"Because of the work that we did [in Ferguson in 2014], such a foundation was laid to where some of this is easier for people-so more people have been activated,\" she says. \"Now people are looking for those candidates. They're like, 'Okay, you've been actually doing this work.' That has been a huge boost to our campaign.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Cori Bush, D-Mo., has lost her primary, handing a pro-Israel group another victory against a member of the progressive \"squad\" of lawmakers.\n\nSt. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell has defeated Bush, NBC News projects. Bell is expected to carry Missouri's deep-blue 1st Congressional District in November after a primary that exposed the party's divisions on Israel, with Bush a vocal critic of the Israeli government and the country's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks on Oct. 7.\n\n\"I'll be a progressive member of Congress, but I'm also going to be a practical member of Congress,\" Bell told NBC News over the weekend. \"I recognize that we can't get anything done without majorities, and so that means we need to work with our fellow Democrats up there, and we also when we can reach across the aisle and work with folks to get things done for this region and for this country.\"\n\nUnited Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby, poured nearly $9 million onto the airwaves attacking Bush and boosting Bell. Bell had initially been running for the Senate, but he decided to challenge Bush in a primary a few weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nAnd the massive funding made the primary one of Tuesday's highest-profile races, as voters in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington voted for nominees in congressional races.\n\nWhile Bush's criticism of Israel drew millions of dollars into the race, the candidates launched other attacks against each other. Bell argued that Bush has not been an effective congresswoman, pointing to her votes against the bipartisan infrastructure package and the child tax credit.\n\nBush, meanwhile, focused her closing argument against Bell about the failure to bring charges against the police officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, featuring Brown's father in her final ad of the race.\n\nThe fallout from Brown's killing propelled both Bush's and Bell's careers - Bell as a prosecutor focused on police reform and Bush as a Black Lives Matter activist.\n\nBush indicated she may not be disappearing from political life.\n\n\"One thing I don't do is go away,\" Bush told NBC News over the weekend, noting that she made unsuccessful runs for Congress before her primary victory against longtime Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in 2020.\n\n\"The thing is it's not about me. So do we have a 'Medicare for All' right now? No. And so what happens on Aug. 6, it's not going to be delivered that day,\" she added later. \"So then that means that I still have to work for those things. I'm in the community, and I'm trying to have change for the community. And so I won't stop just because of a title change.\"\n\nBush wasn't the only Democratic incumbent facing a primary challenge Tuesday, but she was the only one who lost. Rep. Shri Thanedar won his primary against Detroit City Council Member Mary Waters, NBC News projects.\n\nTuesday's primaries also set the general election in Michigan's Senate race, with Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and GOP former Rep. Mike Rogers winning their primaries, NBC News projects.\n\nMichigan will be crucial in the battles for the Senate and the White House.\n\nSlotkin and Rogers were their party's front-runners heading into Tuesday's primaries. Slotkin, a prolific fundraiser who has spent more than $15 million on the race, defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic contest.\n\nRogers had former President Donald Trump's endorsement, and some of his top GOP opponents ended their campaigns before the primary. Rogers defeated former Rep. Justin Amash to win the Republican nomination.\n\nThe Michigan race is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country. President Joe Biden won the state by less than 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nSlotkin's Senate run also opened up her competitive 7th District, and the parties had coalesced around two former state senators: Republican Tom Barrett, who lost a close race to Slotkin two years ago, and Democrat Curtis Hertel.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet and Republican Paul Junge won their respective primaries in Michigan's competitive 8th District, NBC News projects, setting the matchup in the open seat contest to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee.\n\nJunge is a former criminal prosecutor and TV news anchor who served in the Trump administration and had Trump's endorsement in the primary. Junge also ran against Kildee in 2022, and lost by 10 points.\n\nIn another House battleground, Republicans picked physician Prasnath Reddy to take on Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids in Kansas' 3rd District. Davids has built up a financial advantage, with nearly $2.8 million in her campaign account ahead of the primary, while Reddy had $696,000 in his account.\n\nAnd in Washington, Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will have a rematch against Republican Joe Kent, The Associated Press projects. Kent is a controversial Army veteran who lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by 1 percentage point in 2022.\n\nKent, who has faced allegations about his ties to extreme groups , had Trump's endorsement in the primary, and he defeated Camas City Council member Leslie Lewallen for the GOP nomination.\n\nThe 3rd District is a top target for Republicans, as Gluesenkamp Perez is one of five Democrats representing districts Trump won in 2020.\n\nThe matchup was also set in Washington's competitive 8th District, with Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier facing off against Republican Carmen Goers, a commercial banker, in November.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Derek Schmidt won the GOP primary to replace retiring Republican Rep. Jake LaTurner in Kansas' red 2nd District, the AP projects. Schmidt got a boost from Trump's endorsement and from an outside group, Conservatives for American Excellence.\n\nIt's one of several Tuesday primaries in which Trump endorsed, including one in Washington featuring a rare Republican who voted to impeach him in 2021 and is still in Congress. GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse faces a pair of Trump-backed challengers in their all-party, top-two primary.\n\nTrump also notched a win in Missouri's deep-red 3rd District, where state Sen. Bob Onder won the Republican primary to replace retiring GOP Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer.\n\nThe primary has attracted millions of dollars in outside spending. The conservative Club for Growth Action has backed Onder, while two establishment groups active in other GOP primaries , Conservatives for American Excellence and America Leads Action Inc., have launched ads attacking him.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe won the GOP primary for governor in his state, the AP projects. Trump had hedged his bets in the race, endorsing Kehoe and two of the other top contenders, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nKehoe will face Democratic state Rep. Crystal Quade in November, but Republicans are expected to retain control of the Governor's Mansion.\n\nI cover politics for NBC News, focusing on House and Senate races, polling and campaign finance.

LOUIS - Democratic Rep. Cori Bush greeted volunteers and supporters two days before Tuesday's primary election with a buoyant chant: \"I believe that we will win!\"\n\nBush is known as a fighter; it's how she went from being an unhoused single mom protesting on the streets of Ferguson to becoming a prominent member of the so-called squad of progressive House members in Washington. But now, the activist-turned-politician is fighting to avoid losing a primary against a well-funded challenger - four years after she came to Washington by defeating the then-incumbent in a primary.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sense of why so much money would be spent in our congressional race when our district has so many needs,\" an exasperated Bush told NBC News in an interview on a sweltering summer day.\n\nShe was referring to the more than $18 million spent in her race against Wesley Bell, making it the second most expensive House primary in the nation. Bell, who is St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney, has had significantly more ad backup in the race thanks to a nearly $9 million infusion from a pro-Israel group seeking to oust Bush, an outspoken Israel critic.\n\nBell has consistently maintained that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas and said he would be supportive of the U.S. ally if elected. There are other issues in the race, including a Justice Department investigation into Bush's use of campaign money (Bush has said she's cooperating with the investigation and denies using funds improperly). But Israel - and the ads pouring in to contest the issue - has become a central part of another campaign just five weeks after Bush watched a fellow \"squad\" member, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, lose a New York primary that largely centered around Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nReflecting on the most difficult race of her political career, Bush compared her experience to that of Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that some in the party doubted her ascension as the Democratic presidential candidate after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\n\"People were like, 'No, we need to look for another person'. But she's been right there this whole time,\" Bush said. \"We are not, as a country, going to just step over the leadership of a Black woman. Or any woman ... and for me, it felt like a direct attack, because that is what I feel is happening to me right now.\"\n\n\"It was 52 years where two Black men held the seat. I've been in the seat three years, and it's enough?\" Bush said. \"It'd be different if I wasn't delivering dollars to the district.\"\n\nBush and Bell, both self-described progressives, have similar positions on most issues: They both believe in lowering health care costs, making the community safer and enacting policies that aim to help the working class. Abortion rights, on the ballot in Missouri, have also been central to both campaigns.\n\nBush acknowledged the similarities but argued that she has been more \"in step with the community\" she represents in Washington, including introducing a resolution for a cease-fire in Gaza that mirrored one backed by the progressive mayor of St. Louis city, a blue dot in a ruby-red state.\n\nA vocal critic of Israel's government, Bush has rallied against funding for the Jewish state in protest over its military campaign in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Bush accused Israel of an \"ethnic cleansing campaign\" as the country retaliated.\n\nAlong with other Democrats, Bush snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress this month. She supported college campus protests and brought a Palestinian student to Biden's State of the Union address in March while publicly opposing the administration's policies of supporting Israel.\n\nIn one of her first votes as a member of Congress in 2021, Bush joined eight colleagues in opposing $1 billion in funding for Israel's \"Iron Dome,\" its short-range missile defense system. She blasted Israel as an \"apartheid state\" and called for additional resources for Palestine instead.\n\nSome Jewish community leaders have condemned Bush's positions. A group of 30 rabbis from the area endorsed Bell in the spring and accused Bush of antisemitism.\n\nBush doubled down on her rhetoric. \"Do I regret trying to work to save the lives of those 40,000 Palestinians who are now gone? No, I don't regret that,\" Bush said. \"Because I fight against antisemitism and Islamophobia. I fight against all forms of hatred.\"\n\nBell took notice of Bush's positions - and the resulting fractures in the community, where at least 60,000 Jews lived as of 2015, according to the Jewish Federation of St. Louis.\n\nBell abandoned his long-shot bid against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley last year and instead mounted an aggressive campaign against Bush, whom he once vowed not to challenge, according to leaked audio obtained by NBC affiliate KSDK and verified by both Bell and Bush.\n\n\"Ironically, the Senate race is what opened my eyes to the needs of this particular district,\" Bell told NBC News during a gathering at a downtown restaurant. \"And then the straw that broke the camel's back for me was when I met with folks on the ground in D.C., and the recurring theme of not only is your congresswoman not working with folks, but it's hurting your district.\"\n\nBell has also put a magnifying glass on Bush's campaign spending, highlighting the probe into her campaign's hiring of Bush's romantic partner to provide security services. Bush confirmed the federal investigation but referred to the complaints as \"baseless.\"\n\nBoth Bush and Bell argued that the race is about more than just the Middle East.\n\nBush, a registered nurse, touted endorsements from local labor and union leaders as well as reproductive rights organizations, while Bell defended his record as a prosecutor who pledged criminal justice reform to a community that has had a difficult relationship with police.\n\nBush and Bell's political careers were both launched following days of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer shot and killed a Black teenager, Mike Brown, in 2014. Bush gained notice as a Black Lives Matter activist, and Bell won a race for city council in Ferguson and later unseated a longtime incumbent to become a Black prosecutor championing police reform.\n\nThe candidates have traded insults in advertisements blanketing the airwaves, including one ad from Bush featuring Michael Brown Sr., who railed against Bell for not bringing charges against the police officer who shot and killed his son. (Bell said the decision was \"one of the most difficult things\" he has had to do.)\n\nBell, meanwhile, spent a majority of his remarks before a supportive crowd on Sunday defending his record. \"We got community policing, we got court reforms, we got body cameras for every single officer in our district, and we did that by figuring out ways to work together,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. Katherine Clark, a member of House Democratic leadership, traveled to Missouri to stump for Bush. She told supporters that Bush is involved with the party's caucus in Washington and works not only with other Democrats but across the aisle, hoping to soften the blow of Bell's attack against her - most notably that Bush voted against Biden's signature Infrastructure law because it omitted more progressive policies.\n\nIt's the kind of ground support that Bowman lacked in his New York primary, though he too was endorsed by leadership, which traditionally backs incumbents.\n\nBell closed out his event by telling the intimate gathering he's \"feeling good\" about winning Tuesday's election.\n\nBush is in a similar mindset.\n\n\"We will win,\" she said in response to a question about a potential loss. \"But I won't stop just because of a title change. I'm not there for the title, I'm there for the benefit to the community.\"\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

That campaign was mounted by groups that support Israel's devastating, ten-month assault on the Palestinian enclave, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the United Democracy Project, AIPAC's super PAC.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to Gaza has been so extreme that the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has applied for arrest warrants against the Israeli leader-as well as leaders of the Hamas, the Palestinian group that was responsible for the horrific October 7 attacks on Israeli kibbutzim and a music festival-on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush became the second prominent ceasefire supporter to be defeated this summer, after New York Democrat Jamaal Bowman lost in a late June primary that saw even higher levels of spending by pro-Israel groups. Yet, in the same election cycle that Bowman and Bush were defeated, two of the House's most prominent backers of a ceasefire-New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib -were easily renominated. And, in fact, most congressional backers of a ceasefire have been or will be renominated and reelected.\n\nWhat made the difference in the cases of Bowman and Bush was massive spending by outside groups, many of which have been funded by frequent Republican donors, noted Justice Democrats, a group that backed Bush.\n\n\"Cori was our first Justice Democrat because she embodied the change we wanted to see in the Democratic Party-working class people representing working class districts. That power-of everyday people to transform what we can expect from our political system is such a threat to right-wing power, corporate interests, and AIPAC's influence in Congress that a coalition of Republican-funded Super PACs had to spend over $12 million to even have a chance at defeating it,\" Justice Democrats said on X.\n\n\"It's time for the whole of our Party to unite against the influence of big money in politics, end record-breaking primaries funded by corporate Super PACs, and transform our electoral political system to put everyday people back at the center of our democracy-not billionaires,\" Justice Democrats added.\n\nBeth Miller, the political director for Jewish Voice for Peace Action PAC, responded to the result along similar lines.\n\n\"Extremist, pro-genocide groups like AIPAC are losing the war for public opinion, so now they're buying elections,\" said Miller. \"We are proud to have supported a champion for justice like Congresswoman Bush and will continue organizing to overcome anti-democratic, pro-war Super PACs and to build a government that actually serves all people-no exceptions.\"\n\nTuesday's result was a political setback for Bush, an activist turned candidate who has won and lost elections in the past, and who may well win again in the future. But whatever her electoral trajectory may be, history will record that Bush won the moral high ground many months ago, when she put aside political calculations and did what she knew was right.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack, as The Nation noted earlier this year in recognizing Bush's courageous approach to some of the most politically challenging issues of our time, the representative quickly condemned the targeting of civilians and pledged to aid constituents who had loved ones in the region. But unlike most members of Congress, the Missouri Democrat didn't stop there. She called for \"an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation to prevent further loss of life.\" And she said, \"Violations of human rights do not justify more violations of human rights, and a military response will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike.\"\n\nThat was not a position that most members of Congress, even most progressives, were willing to take at the time. It earned Bush sharp rebukes and the threat of a 2024 primary challenge that everyone assumed would be financed by the political arms of AIPAC and other groups that support Israeli hard-liners. Yet, Bush remained steadfast. As Israel's assault on Gaza intensified, she emerged as the chief sponsor of the House \"Ceasefire Now\" resolution , which called on the Biden administration to exhaust every diplomatic tool to end the assault on Gaza-an assault that, as of this week, has left 36,600 Palestinians dead and 91,469 Palestinians wounded , that has seen much of the civilian infrastructure of Gaza destroyed, and that has led to accusations of genocide before the ICC. Bush and the resolution's cosponsors, such as Michigan's Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, were harshly criticized, often by their fellow Democrats. But they persevered, creating a congressional touchstone for the mass movement that seeks to persuade the US to stop giving Netanyahu and his right-wing allies a blank check.\n\n\"We can't bomb our way to peace, equality, and freedom,\" explained the representative from Missouri on October 16. \"With thousands of lives lost and millions more at stake, we need a ceasefire now.\"\n\nTen months later, many prominent Democrats echo those sentiments. Even Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's nominee for president, now says , \"It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nAfter meeting with the Israeli leader last month, Harris announced, \"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this [ceasefire] deal done.\"\n\n\"So, to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace,\" added the vice president, \"I see you and I hear you.\"\n\nCori Bush may have lost her seat in the House in Tuesday's Missouri primary. But, now and in the future, Bush will remain the representative who stood on the right side of history.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But I am a St. Louis Jew and I could not be more proud to support her.\n\nSome of this is due, of course, to Cori's brave commitment to the people of Gaza -a commitment that has made her a target of right-wing donors eager to remove anyone who stands for Palestinian rights from office. But I want to talk about her approach to an issue that, though it hasn't received nearly as much attention, is an equally vivid demonstration of Cori's values, character, and courage. That issue is climate change.\n\nPoll after poll ranks climate as a top issue for American Jews, and I wholeheartedly agree. I spent the last several years as political director of Sierra Club Missouri, and I can't imagine a better climate champion than Cori Bush.\n\nAs we experience the hottest summer on record, it is more vital than ever that our government invest in renewable energy. Representative Bush has been out front, introducing and passing legislation that has delivered over $1 billion in climate investments to protect our future. In 2022, the House passed Cori's Energy Security and Independence Act , which allocated over $100 million under the Defense Production Act to invest in and deploy clean energy technology. These historic investments have enabled federal agencies to move faster to meet their climate goals. This is a huge step toward converting the country to green energy.\n\nShe also recognized that climate change and pollution have not impacted everyone equally. That's why she introduced the Environmental Justice and Mapping Act, which was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation provides $60 million for the federal government to collect data on how climate change and environmental pollution impact different communities. This is vital information that will enable the federal government to direct resources to the communities that have faced environmental racism and injustice. Bush-more than any other politician I have encountered-is committed to ensuring that the legislation she pushes forward corrects historical injustices, including the toll that pollution and climate change have taken on Black, brown, and working-class communities.\n\nRepresentative Bush has recognized that climate change is not a far-off problem but something that is impacting us right now. In the wake of devastating flooding in St. Louis, she secured over $200 million for public transit systems impacted by natural disasters across the country, including $27 million for the St. Louis area.\n\nWe cannot wait to invest in building resilient communities that can withstand the destruction being wreaked by climate change. We need to ensure that Bush can stay in office to keep fighting for the frontline communities who are facing the brunt of climate disaster.\n\nBush has consistently taken a stand to clean up dangerous pollution and to oppose new projects that would fuel further climate change. She has fought hard to clean up radioactive waste at Westlake Landfill, which has contaminated Coldwater Creek and put nearby residents in danger. She also worked to hold the local gas company, Spire Energy, accountable after it warned St. Louis residents that there could be power outages unless its unlawfully built pipeline was approved by the federal government. Representative Bush directly called out Spire's misinformation, condemned its action, and then encouraged the federal regulator that oversees pipelines to investigate Spire. Cori is not afraid to go up against fossil fuel companies and polluters to keep our communities safe.\n\nSome have criticized Representative Bush for voting against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, saying that she undermined historic investments in green jobs and infrastructure. In reality, she voted together with other progressives seeking to ensure that President Biden's broader Build Back Better Act wouldn't be discarded as soon as the smaller, more moderate Infrastructure Bill was passed. Unfortunately, Representative Bush was proven right when moderate Democrats joined Republicans to block the Build Back Better Act. She has voted with the AFL-CIO every other time, and although the infrastructure bill vote took place in 2021, it was not even an issue in her 2022 reelection race.\n\nMost of the attack ads and mailers criticizing this one principled vote are coming from the United Democracy Project , the GOP megadonor-funded super PAC affiliated with the right-wing American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). AIPAC is attacking Representative Bush because of her principled stance in opposing the Israeli military's brutal assault on Gaza, which has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, forced most residents of Gaza out of their homes and onto the brink of starvation , and wreaked ecological disaster. Her commitment to the fundamental right to life, safety, and freedom for Palestinians and Israelis is a reason to support her, not spend millions of dollars attacking her.\n\nClimate change is the biggest threat facing our community, as every year brings new \"once-in-a-lifetime\" natural disasters and ever-soaring record temperatures. If we want to tackle this existential threat, we cannot elect a moderate with close ties to extremist Republicans. We must send Cori Bush back to Congress to keep fighting for us, for all of us.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

L ouis, M o. -According to a Harvard study , transportation is the single most important factor in an individual's ability to escape poverty. In July 2022, a one-in-1,000-year flooding event hit St. Louis, dumping 25 percent of the normal yearly rainfall on the city in 12 hours. 1 The July deluge caused $18 million in damages to St. Louis's MetroLink light rail network. Whole trains, station elevators, miles of track, and signal houses took significant damage. \"Homes were flooded,\" Representative Cori Bush said in September , 2 \"people lost vehicles and became displaced. That's happened in Georgia , and in Rhode Island too. And in Jackson, Mississippi , a predominantly Black community has no access to clean water. This isn't happening in a community that's affluent.\" 3 Missouri's Bi-State Metro Transit agency requested $22 million in emergency funds, which sent Representative Bush's office on a five-month campaign. \"People told us it couldn't happen,\" Bush told The Nation , \"but I remember being out in the flood water. I was in-district. I just remember it was coming down so hard and so fast, and on social media, we started to see people in trouble in the inner city of St. Louis, and we hit the street.\" 4 Partnering with outgoing Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt, Bush's team organized with other Democratic members of Congress whose districts were also in need of climate-disaster funding. New York delegation members Jamaal Bowman, Jerrold Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Richard Torres, Carolyn Maloney, and Nydia Velazquez requested $75.67 million for the state's Metropolitan Transit Authority-repairs were needed after severe damage from 2021 Hurricanes Ida and Heri-as well as for Puerto Rico's decimated infrastructure from Hurricane Fiona in 2022. Bush threatened to withhold her year-end budget vote unless this nationwide climate disaster funding was approved. \"This was not politics as usual,\" Bush said. \"I couldn't vote for a package that didn't include funds for St. Louis.\" 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer In January 2022, Bush won. President Biden's year-end omnibus budget approved $213.9 million through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Climate Relief Fund (49 USC 5324). The aid is spread across four years, and will address an enormous backlog of needed investment across the country, including the 2022 flood damage in St. Louis. \"The best way to describe it is that that fund was going to have zero dollars in it,\" Bush said. \"We didn't know that we would get it done, our office was working hard, and we were up against time.\" 6 Current Issue View our current issue The Climate Relief Fund repairs light rail, bus networks, subway tunnels, water taxis, ferry operations, and other transit systems across the country that have been damaged or destroyed by cataclysmic weather such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. In the coming months, eligible transit providers with disaster claims for 2017, 2020, 2021, and 2022 can apply for funding. \"We're talking about emergency relief funds,\" Bush said. \"This is an area we had to push a lot, and center St. Louis, and center people riding the Metro system.\" 7 Yearly climate disasters are rapidly increasing in frequency and magnitude because of global warming. In 2017, Hurricane Irma became the harshest system to hit the US since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. That year, the 2017 FTA Climate Relief Fund was $0. 8 \"We know it's a class issue,\" Bush told The Nation . \"Lots of folks in Congress have never had to rely on a transit system. People have work, doctor appointments, child care. They shouldn't have to worry about this.\" 9 T he story of the FTA funding is about standing in place rather than losing ground, which often reflects the larger state of US public transit. After years of neglect, the multibillion-dollar public transit repair backlog is also being addressed in President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)-two of the biggest transportation bills of the decade. 10 The infrastructure bill touts $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years, and aims to modernize systems while repairing \"24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement.\" 11 The IRA is the United States' first major investment in climate change mitigation, focusing on tax credits, loans, and grants , as well as \"billions to modernize the electric grid, build a nationwide network of electric vehicle chargers, strengthen the battery supply chain, expand public transit and passenger rail.\" 12 But climate experts and transit engineers agree that vehicle electrification is an inadequate response to both global warming and moving people around, which is why Bush has centered public transit in her legislative efforts. 13 St. Louis's MetroLink is scheduled for a long-overdue North-South expansion , and in December of 2022, alongside fellow House Democrats, Bush introduced the Bus Rapid Transit Act and the Light Rail Transit Act , with the goal of transforming public transit in St. Louis and across the country to \"make getting around our communities more equitable,\" the representative said. The bills aim to jump-start new systems and improve existing programs while creating new jobs, reducing emissions, and improving connectivity. 14 While the Biden administration has made progress, global carbon emissions need to decrease by 45 percent by 2030 if we are to reach \"net zero\" by 2050, and the US transportation sector is the largest contributor to CO 2 emissions . While US carbon output has fallen since the mid-2000s, it has not decreased as quickly as our European counterparts'. 15 Roads, highways, and car infrastructure continue to consume vast resources, as in Missouri Governor Mike Parson's proposal to improve Interstate 70 to the tune of $859 million-made despite expert consensus that bigger roads and additional lanes only make traffic worse , and cement production requires massive CO 2 emissions. 16 \"I think we need a new era of enormous public investment,\" Bush said. \"If these crazy climate floods are possible, we have to imagine new possibilities for how we respond. We spend billions and billions on weapons of war, and act like it's so hard to pay for trains.\" 17\n\nThe July deluge caused $18 million in damages to St. Louis's MetroLink light rail network.

President Biden's year-end omnibus budget approved $213.9 million through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Climate Relief Fund (49 USC 5324). The aid is spread across four years, and will address an enormous backlog of needed investment across the country, including the 2022 flood damage in St. Louis. \"The best way to describe it is that that fund was going to have zero dollars in it,\" Bush said. \"We didn't know that we would get it done, our office was working hard, and we were up against time.\" 6 Current Issue View our current issue The Climate Relief Fund repairs light rail, bus networks, subway tunnels, water taxis, ferry operations, and other transit systems across the country that have been damaged or destroyed by cataclysmic weather such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. In the coming months, eligible transit providers with disaster claims for 2017, 2020, 2021, and 2022 can apply for funding. \"We're talking about emergency relief funds,\" Bush said. \"This is an area we had to push a lot, and center St. Louis, and center people riding the Metro system.\" 7 Yearly climate disasters are rapidly increasing in frequency and magnitude because of global warming. In 2017, Hurricane Irma became the harshest system to hit the US since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. That year, the 2017 FTA Climate Relief Fund was $0. 8 \"We know it's a class issue,\" Bush told The Nation . \"Lots of folks in Congress have never had to rely on a transit system. People have work, doctor appointments, child care. They shouldn't have to worry about this.\" 9 T he story of the FTA funding is about standing in place rather than losing ground, which often reflects the larger state of US public transit. After years of neglect, the multibillion-dollar public transit repair backlog is also being addressed in President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)-two of the biggest transportation bills of the decade. 10 The infrastructure bill touts $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years, and aims to modernize systems while repairing \"24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement.\" 11 The IRA is the United States' first major investment in climate change mitigation, focusing on tax credits, loans, and grants , as well as \"billions to modernize the electric grid, build a nationwide network of electric vehicle chargers, strengthen the battery supply chain, expand public transit and passenger rail.\" 12 But climate experts and transit engineers agree that vehicle electrification is an inadequate response to both global warming and moving people around, which is why Bush has centered public transit in her legislative efforts. 13 St. Louis's MetroLink is scheduled for a long-overdue North-South expansion , and in December of 2022, alongside fellow House Democrats, Bush introduced the Bus Rapid Transit Act and the Light Rail Transit Act , with the goal of transforming public transit in St. Louis and across the country to \"make getting around our communities more equitable,\" the representative said.

Activate your online access\n\nIf AIPAC and its donors defeat her, we won't just be losing one of Palestine's staunchest allies but also one of the climate movement's most effective champions.\n\nCori Bush attends a news conference outside the US Capitol on May 8, 2024.\n\nIn recent weeks, I have read endless takes on social media and in newspapers saying that Jews in St. Louis will be voting against Cori Bush in her congressional primary election on Tuesday. But I am a St. Louis Jew and I could not be more proud to support her.\n\nSome of this is due, of course, to Cori's brave commitment to the people of Gaza -a commitment that has made her a target of right-wing donors eager to remove anyone who stands for Palestinian rights from office. But I want to talk about her approach to an issue that, though it hasn't received nearly as much attention, is an equally vivid demonstration of Cori's values, character, and courage. That issue is climate change.\n\nPoll after poll ranks climate as a top issue for American Jews, and I wholeheartedly agree. I spent the last several years as political director of Sierra Club Missouri, and I can't imagine a better climate champion than Cori Bush.\n\nAs we experience the hottest summer on record, it is more vital than ever that our government invest in renewable energy. Representative Bush has been out front, introducing and passing legislation that has delivered over $1 billion in climate investments to protect our future. In 2022, the House passed Cori's Energy Security and Independence Act , which allocated over $100 million under the Defense Production Act to invest in and deploy clean energy technology. These historic investments have enabled federal agencies to move faster to meet their climate goals. This is a huge step toward converting the country to green energy.\n\nShe also recognized that climate change and pollution have not impacted everyone equally. That's why she introduced the Environmental Justice and Mapping Act, which was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation provides $60 million for the federal government to collect data on how climate change and environmental pollution impact different communities. This is vital information that will enable the federal government to direct resources to the communities that have faced environmental racism and injustice. Bush-more than any other politician I have encountered-is committed to ensuring that the legislation she pushes forward corrects historical injustices, including the toll that pollution and climate change have taken on Black, brown, and working-class communities.\n\nRepresentative Bush has recognized that climate change is not a far-off problem but something that is impacting us right now. In the wake of devastating flooding in St. Louis, she secured over $200 million for public transit systems impacted by natural disasters across the country, including $27 million for the St. Louis area.\n\nWe cannot wait to invest in building resilient communities that can withstand the destruction being wreaked by climate change. We need to ensure that Bush can stay in office to keep fighting for the frontline communities who are facing the brunt of climate disaster.\n\nBush has consistently taken a stand to clean up dangerous pollution and to oppose new projects that would fuel further climate change. She has fought hard to clean up radioactive waste at Westlake Landfill, which has contaminated Coldwater Creek and put nearby residents in danger. She also worked to hold the local gas company, Spire Energy, accountable after it warned St. Louis residents that there could be power outages unless its unlawfully built pipeline was approved by the federal government. Representative Bush directly called out Spire's misinformation, condemned its action, and then encouraged the federal regulator that oversees pipelines to investigate Spire. Cori is not afraid to go up against fossil fuel companies and polluters to keep our communities safe.\n\nSome have criticized Representative Bush for voting against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, saying that she undermined historic investments in green jobs and infrastructure. In reality, she voted together with other progressives seeking to ensure that President Biden's broader Build Back Better Act wouldn't be discarded as soon as the smaller, more moderate Infrastructure Bill was passed. Unfortunately, Representative Bush was proven right when moderate Democrats joined Republicans to block the Build Back Better Act. She has voted with the AFL-CIO every other time, and although the infrastructure bill vote took place in 2021, it was not even an issue in her 2022 reelection race.\n\nMost of the attack ads and mailers criticizing this one principled vote are coming from the United Democracy Project , the GOP megadonor-funded super PAC affiliated with the right-wing American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). AIPAC is attacking Representative Bush because of her principled stance in opposing the Israeli military's brutal assault on Gaza, which has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, forced most residents of Gaza out of their homes and onto the brink of starvation , and wreaked ecological disaster. Her commitment to the fundamental right to life, safety, and freedom for Palestinians and Israelis is a reason to support her, not spend millions of dollars attacking her.\n\nClimate change is the biggest threat facing our community, as every year brings new \"once-in-a-lifetime\" natural disasters and ever-soaring record temperatures. If we want to tackle this existential threat, we cannot elect a moderate with close ties to extremist Republicans.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

And it's not going away. \"Headlines said I was the most vulnerable member of the Squad,\" she announced . \"My community responded last night and said our Squad is big. It includes all who believe we must show up for each other and prioritize people over profits. It's here to stay, and it's only getting bigger.\" There was no hyperbole in that statement. The members of \"the Squad,\" young progressive women who shook up politics in 2018, are posting victories in their 2020 reelection runs. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who upset Representative Joe Crowley two years ago, won her June primary in New York with almost 73 percent of the vote. Tlaib, who narrowly prevailed in her 2018 primary and who media reports suggested was in a tight race this year, was winning 66 percent . Representative Ilhan Omar faces a primary challenge next week in Minnesota but looks to be running strong. And Representative Ayanna Pressley, who beat a Democratic incumbent in her 2018 Massachusetts primary, is by all accounts coasting to reelection this year. Noting the size of Tlaib's win, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted , \"She didn't 'survive'-she *overwhelmed* at the polls. Throughout our first term, we've been told our advocacy is 'too much' to be re-elected.\" Instead, voters supported Tlaib, who led the charge for impeaching President Trump, two to one. It didn't stop with Tlaib. Activist supporters of Medicare for All and a Green New Deal-proposals that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has shied away from and that Democratic platform drafters left out of their 2020 document-weren't just reelecting members of the Squad. They were nominating new members.

In Missouri, Cori Bush won a rematch primary with 20-year incumbent Representative William Lacy Clay, who has held the safely Democratic St. Louis-area seat since his father, Bill Clay , retired in 2001. Backed by Justice Democrats and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Bush campaigned as a nurse and a leader in the racial justice movements that emerged in Ferguson after Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in 2014.

But St. Louis showed up today,\" Bush declared after the results came in. \"It is historic that this year, of all the years, we are sending a Black working-class single mother who's been fighting for Black lives since Ferguson all the way to the halls of Congress.\" As the primary election approached, Bush, who was hospitalized during the campaign as she battled Covid-19, was counted out by many pundits, with Clay securing endorsements from party leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Senator Kamala Harris, as well as groups such as the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Sierra Club Independent Action. Yet Bush prevailed by around 4,500 votes on a day when Missouri voters also approved a plan to expand Medicaid and renominated a pair of progressive reformers, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner and St. Louis Treasurer Tishaura Jones . Nomiki Konst, a veteran activist who's on the board of Matriarch -a national group Bush helped organize that assists working-class progressive women in getting elected-says Bush overcame enormous odds to secure a win with national implications. Current Issue View our current issue Her victory follows progressive successes this year for Marie Newman , who beat socially conservative Democratic Representative Dan Lipinski in a March Illinois primary. And for Jamaal Bowman , who beat House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel in June in New York; those primaries also yielded victories for young progressives such as 33-year-old Mondaire Jones and 32-year-old Ritchie Torres in contests for retiring House veterans' open seats. And for Kara Eastman in Nebraska, who took her primary in May. And, perhaps, for others such as Holyoke, Mass., Mayor Alex Morse , who is taking on House Committee on Ways and Means chair Richard Neal in a September 1 Democratic primary. \"It looks like we're in the middle of something,\" said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a former cochair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"There's a lot of ways to look at it, but I think it's proof that Bernie was right. He may not have won, but his movement's winning. And it's going to keep on winning.\" Bush acknowledged the Sanders connection in her victory speech, telling the crowd , \"Let me also thank somebody who stood with me that did not have to stand with me.... I gotta call out Senator Bernie Sanders.\" Sanders, who planned to host a virtual town hall meeting Wednesday night with Bush, Bowman, and Tlaib, hailed Bush's \"incredible upset win in Missouri.\" \"So what do these victories say about the current moment?\" asked the former 2020 Democratic presidential contender. \"Don't let anyone fool you. The truth is, despite the opposition of powerful special interests, we are transforming American politics. The political revolution is gaining more and more support.\" Bush's and Tlaib's wins also highlighted the work of Justice Democrats, a group that has endorsed and organized on behalf of insurgents who challenge Democrats with corporate ties. \"This is a huge upset and another groundbreaking win for our movement against a corporate-backed political dynasty,\" said its executive director, Alexandra Rojas, of the win by Bush, who had \"organized a movement through pepper spray and rioting police in the streets of Ferguson. Her tenacity and unbreakable pursuit of justice is desperately needed in Congress today.\" That movement energy is not to be underestimated. At a time when Democrats in D.C. still wrestle with the question of how bold the party should be, Bush offers an answer. \"Tonight, Missouri's First [Congressional District] has decided that an incremental approach isn't going to work any longer,\" she declared at a victory party where she saluted movement politics by raising a clenched fist of solidarity in the air. \"We decided that we the people have the answers and we will lead from the front lines.\" Correction: A previous version of this article misidentified the Illinois Democratic congressman who lost to Marie Newman in a primary race earlier this year.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The Missouri representative's bold strategy worked. She got the White House to act, temporarily saving millions of Americans from the threat of losing shelter during a pandemic. Now, with the Supreme Court decision to block the moratorium , she's going to be just as bold. \"We already know who is going to bear the brunt of this disastrous decision-Black and brown communities, and especially Black women,\" Bush said after the ruling was released Thursday evening. \"We didn't sleep on those steps just to give up now. Congress must act immediately to prevent mass evictions and I am exploring every possible option.\" The high court's ruling upended a version of the ban on evictions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued on August 3, shortly after a previous moratorium expired amid wrangling between the administration and congressional leaders over how to extend it. While others debated over who should take responsibility for extending the moratorium as it expired in late July, Bush demanded action. She brought a sense of urgency to the fight, recalling her own experience with evictions . And she won headline-grabbing support from Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In so doing, Bush gave voice to a national outcry over the prospect that as many as 3.6 million households could face eviction orders within two months. They are among the 11 million Americans who have fallen behind on rent payments during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis of US Census Bureau data by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .

Katrina vanden Heuvel Bush lit a fire under the Biden administration, and the White House has continued to take steps to make it easier for renters to work with landlords to get emergency rental assistance. But the Supreme Court ruling has renewed the crisis. The court's conservative majority ruled that the executive branch didn't have the authority to extend the moratorium. \"Congress was on notice that a further extension would almost surely require new legislation, yet it failed to act in the several weeks leading up to the moratorium's expiration,\" argued the decision. \"If a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue, Congress must specifically authorize it.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Liberal justices dissented, with Justice Stephen Breyer explaining that, with \"the health of millions\" at stake, the CDC acted properly to assure that vulnerable Americans are not thrown into more precarious circumstances in the midst of a surging pandemic. \"COVID-19 transmission rates have spiked in recent weeks, reaching levels that the CDC puts as high as last winter: 150,000 new cases per day,\" Breyer wrote, in an argument for \"considered decision making\" on the issue. Current Issue View our current issue W ithin minutes of the court's ruling against Biden's Emergency Eviction Moratorium, Bush announced, \"Tonight, the Supreme Court failed to protect the 11 million households across our country from violent eviction in the middle of a deadly global pandemic. We are in an unprecedented and ongoing crisis that demands compassionate solutions that center the needs of the people and communities most in need of our help. We need to give our communities time to heal from this devastating pandemic.\" But Bush did not merely decry the court ruling. She presented \"immediate options\" to avert an eviction crisis. They include proposals for the House to reconvene for an emergency vote on HR 4791 , a bill, introduced by House Financial Services Committee chair Maxine Waters, to extend the moratorium through December 31, as well as a plan to have the House amend the Public Health Service Act to provide the Department of Health and Human Services with the legal authority to mandate that evictions stop until the pandemic is officially over. On the phone with fellow members, Bush made a blunt pitch for them \"to reflect on the humanity of every single one of their unhoused, or soon to be unhoused, neighbors, and support a legislative solution to this eviction crisis.\" Bush knows she's got a fight ahead of her. She understands that pushing for congressional action is just one piece of the puzzle-especially considering the caution of the narrow Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. But her outspoken advocacy keeps that fire lit under the Biden administration, and it raises the prospect that congressional Democrats might use the ongoing budget reconciliation process to strengthen the hand of the CDC and other agencies when it comes to preventing evictions.\n\nNow, with the Supreme Court decision to block the moratorium , she's going to be just as bold. \"We already know who is going to bear the brunt of this disastrous decision-Black and brown communities, and especially Black women,\" Bush said after the ruling was released Thursday evening. \"We didn't sleep on those steps just to give up now.

While others debated over who should take responsibility for extending the moratorium as it expired in late July, Bush demanded action. She brought a sense of urgency to the fight, recalling her own experience with evictions . And she won headline-grabbing support from Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In so doing, Bush gave voice to a national outcry over the prospect that as many as 3.6 million households could face eviction orders within two months. They are among the 11 million Americans who have fallen behind on rent payments during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis of US Census Bureau data by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

For these reasons and more, voters of Missouri's first district renominated Representative Cori Bush to the Democratic ticket, nearly guaranteeing her a second term in office in a deep-blue district representing most of St. Louis. Bush will go back to Washington with a climate bill specially designed to finance urban environmental cleanup and decarbonization, the Green New Deals for Cities Act of 2021 ( HR 2644 ). \"It's the people who put our pressure on our politicians,\" Bush told The Nation . \"The voters, the people, and the local governments need to know that this funding can be available.\" Cosponsored by Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, HR 2644 would distribute $1 trillion directly to cities, towns, and Native American tribes over a period of four years, bypassing conservative state legislatures to empower local governments. \"St. Louis has been in need of more investment for such a long time,\" the congresswoman said. \"We see it in other cities, too, like Flint, and now Jackson,\" all of which now share a catastrophic drinking water crisis. \"We know our walls are full of lead paint. Black children are hospitalized with asthma with 10 times the frequency as white children.\" Congresswoman Cori Bush. (Devin Thomas O'Shea) Of 72 cities surveyed by the Equity Indicators Project, which measures racial disparities in areas like health care, education, and employment, St. Louis was the lowest-scoring city for asthma-related health problems. Dust and mold in housing are serious contributors, but so is poverty, which puts adequate health care out of reach. These systemic issues are only made worse by extreme weather events occasioned by climate change, which are already wreaking havoc on decrepit US infrastructure. In July 2022, St. Louis experienced a one-in-a-thousand-years flooding event . Roughly 25 percent of the area's normal yearly rainfall fell in about 12 hours. Bush said, \"Homes were flooded, people lost vehicles and became displaced. That's happened in Georgia , and in Rhode Island too. And in Jackson, Mississippi , a predominantly Black community has no access to clean water. This isn't happening in a community that's affluent.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer With 46 politicians signed on, including Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Jim McGovern , the Green New Deals for Cities Act is meant to be a broad, flexible, revenue-sharing model. It is based on crisis legislation like the Heroes Act , which was designed to get coronavirus aid to frontline communities. Bush argues that cities should receive funding for the climate crisis just like they received funding for Covid. \"There have been 11 more 90-degree days [per year on average] than when I was born,\" she said. \"This is documented, this is researched, and we need this direct investment.\" Current Issue View our current issue The funding is focused on local needs like replacing lead pipes, retrofitting water infrastructure, building bike lanes, installing electric vehicle charging stations, testing soil and water for contaminants, and phasing out fossil fuel infrastructure, among other options. The bill also supports reparations programs for Black and Indigenous communities to remediate historical environmental injustices, but the details of that aspect of the program are not yet defined. For new infrastructure projects, the bill gives \"preference to local hiring,\" creating opportunities for people of color, immigrants, women, and the formerly incarcerated.

We have to continue to act deliberately and creatively. My GND for Cities bill does that. This bill makes the focus local.\" And there are many local issues in St. Louis. About 70 percent of Missouri's energy comes from coal burned in fire plants. Arch Coal and Peabody Coal ( now Arch Resources, and Peabody Energy ) have their headquarters in the city. As of 2020, the state spends $870 million importing coal via rail each year, down from $1.13 billion in 2008 . That revenue network props up conservative, obstructionist Democratic senators like Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Mining strategies like mountaintop removal contribute to apocalyptic environmental issues in Appalachian districts under Manchin's leadership, and coal is wildly inefficient , dirty beyond comprehension, and a massive emitter of carbon-not to mention that it can remain extremely hazardous long after it's burned. Every coal fire plant produces millions of tons of coal ash and slag every year. These byproducts contain mercury, cadmium, and arsenic . An amount of radioactive fly ash is allowed into the air. In Missouri, regulators explicitly allow coal ash pollution in the St. Louis-area water supply. Some waste from coal fire plants can be repackaged and sold, but what's left over is often buried in unlined ash pits . On a warming planet, this creates a monumental threat to food and water systems. Floods and heavy rain cause rising Missouri water tables to seep into ash pits, contaminating the groundwater. According to the Missouri Independent , \"A study from the Environmental Integrity Project shows 91 percent of coal plants have unsafe levels of one or more coal ash toxins in groundwater on or around the property.\" Related Article Democracy Is on the Ballot in 2022.

The Labadie Power Plant and the Rush Island Power Plant, both run by Ameren Electric, are only a few miles away from the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. \"When we look at the coal-burning power plants in Missouri,\" said Bush, \"all of which are leaking, and we look at all the things in that runoff, like arsenic, there's no doubt. We know how it affects the nervous system; it causes heart and kidney polyps. We look at the fact that these sites don't comply with federal regulation. They need to hear our voices. The fossil fuel industry has had an especially powerful grip on Missouri.\" B ecause of Representative Bush's testimony , the Government Accountability Office is evaluating a historic hazardous waste cleanup project completely separate from coal, but similarly exacerbated by flooding. In the 1950s, Mallinckrodt refined uranium for the Manhattan Project in St. Louis. In North St. Louis, there is a Superfund site called Coldwater Creek . In December 1989 , radioactive material was proven to have contaminated the water from a dump site upstream, near Lambert Airport. The radioactive waste was haphazardly barreled and discarded by Mallinckrodt. Between 2008 and 2011, graduates of nearby McCluer North High School noticed an unusual concentration of cancers, birth defects, and other illnesses affecting their cohort. In August 2015 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers admitted that it found excess amounts of thorium-230, a uranium decay product, in the creek. Thorium-230 has a half-life of 75,380 years, and Coldwater Creek has always flooded regularly into local neighborhood gardens, backyards, and public school playgrounds.

Dr. Liz Theoharis It doesn't get better from there. During the cleanup, the creek and original dump site were excavated, and much of the radioactive material was transferred to the West Lake Landfill , which is now in extreme danger of catching on fire. The West Lake and the Bridgeton landfills sit side by side in the same complex of disposal areas. While West Lake contains World War II-era radioactive waste, the Bridgeton site has been dealing with an exothermic reaction that first occurred in 2010 and continues to smolder: Essentially, an underground fire threatens to spread to West Lake, which would send radioactive ash into the air for miles around, depending on wind direction and containment. Emergency response plans have been issued and notices have gone out to nearby residents, but the fact that a fire is burning so close to radioactive waste has alarmed local advocacy groups like Just Moms STL for years.

For example, while cars dominate St. Louis, some of the biggest carbon emitters are the city's poorly insulated buildings , which rely on coal or fossil gas.

Bush will go back to Washington with a climate bill specially designed to finance urban environmental cleanup and decarbonization, the Green New Deals for Cities Act of 2021 ( HR 2644 ). \"It's the people who put our pressure on our politicians,\" Bush told The Nation . \"The voters, the people, and the local governments need to know that this funding can be available.\" Cosponsored by Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, HR 2644 would distribute $1 trillion directly to cities, towns, and Native American tribes over a period of four years, bypassing conservative state legislatures to empower local governments. \"St. Louis has been in need of more investment for such a long time,\" the congresswoman said. \"We see it in other cities, too, like Flint, and now Jackson,\" all of which now share a catastrophic drinking water crisis. \"We know our walls are full of lead paint.

(Devin Thomas O'Shea)\n\nOf 72 cities surveyed by the Equity Indicators Project, which measures racial disparities in areas like health care, education, and employment, St. Louis was the lowest-scoring city for asthma-related health problems. Dust and mold in housing are serious contributors, but so is poverty, which puts adequate health care out of reach. These systemic issues are only made worse by extreme weather events occasioned by climate change, which are already wreaking havoc on decrepit US infrastructure. In July 2022, St. Louis experienced a one-in-a-thousand-years flooding event . Roughly 25 percent of the area's normal yearly rainfall fell in about 12 hours. Bush said, \"Homes were flooded, people lost vehicles and became displaced. That's happened in Georgia , and in Rhode Island too.

Every coal fire plant produces millions of tons of coal ash and slag every year. These byproducts contain mercury, cadmium, and arsenic . An amount of radioactive fly ash is allowed into the air. In Missouri, regulators explicitly allow coal ash pollution in the St. Louis-area water supply. Some waste from coal fire plants can be repackaged and sold, but what's left over is often buried in unlined ash pits . On a warming planet, this creates a monumental threat to food and water systems. Floods and heavy rain cause rising Missouri water tables to seep into ash pits, contaminating the groundwater.

About 70 percent of Missouri's energy comes from coal burned in fire plants. Arch Coal and Peabody Coal ( now Arch Resources, and Peabody Energy ) have their headquarters in the city. As of 2020, the state spends $870 million importing coal via rail each year, down from $1.13 billion in 2008 . That revenue network props up conservative, obstructionist Democratic senators like Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Mining strategies like mountaintop removal contribute to apocalyptic environmental issues in Appalachian districts under Manchin's leadership, and coal is wildly inefficient , dirty beyond comprehension, and a massive emitter of carbon-not to mention that it can remain extremely hazardous long after it's burned. Every coal fire plant produces millions of tons of coal ash and slag every year. These byproducts contain mercury, cadmium, and arsenic . An amount of radioactive fly ash is allowed into the air. In Missouri, regulators explicitly allow coal ash pollution in the St. Louis-area water supply. Some waste from coal fire plants can be repackaged and sold, but what's left over is often buried in unlined ash pits . On a warming planet, this creates a monumental threat to food and water systems. Floods and heavy rain cause rising Missouri water tables to seep into ash pits, contaminating the groundwater. According to the Missouri Independent , \"A study from the Environmental Integrity Project shows 91 percent of coal plants have unsafe levels of one or more coal ash toxins in groundwater on or around the property.\" Related Article Democracy Is on the Ballot in 2022. Summer Lee Is Ready for This Fight. John Nichols There are 25 unlined ash ponds in the state. The Labadie Power Plant and the Rush Island Power Plant, both run by Ameren Electric, are only a few miles away from the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. \"When we look at the coal-burning power plants in Missouri,\" said Bush, \"all of which are leaking, and we look at all the things in that runoff, like arsenic, there's no doubt. We know how it affects the nervous system; it causes heart and kidney polyps. We look at the fact that these sites don't comply with federal regulation. They need to hear our voices. The fossil fuel industry has had an especially powerful grip on Missouri.\" B ecause of Representative Bush's testimony , the Government Accountability Office is evaluating a historic hazardous waste cleanup project completely separate from coal, but similarly exacerbated by flooding. In the 1950s, Mallinckrodt refined uranium for the Manhattan Project in St. Louis. In North St. Louis, there is a Superfund site called Coldwater Creek . In December 1989 , radioactive material was proven to have contaminated the water from a dump site upstream, near Lambert Airport. The radioactive waste was haphazardly barreled and discarded by Mallinckrodt. Between 2008 and 2011, graduates of nearby McCluer North High School noticed an unusual concentration of cancers, birth defects, and other illnesses affecting their cohort. In August 2015 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers admitted that it found excess amounts of thorium-230, a uranium decay product, in the creek. Thorium-230 has a half-life of 75,380 years, and Coldwater Creek has always flooded regularly into local neighborhood gardens, backyards, and public school playgrounds.

Dr. Liz Theoharis It doesn't get better from there. During the cleanup, the creek and original dump site were excavated, and much of the radioactive material was transferred to the West Lake Landfill , which is now in extreme danger of catching on fire. The West Lake and the Bridgeton landfills sit side by side in the same complex of disposal areas. While West Lake contains World War II-era radioactive waste, the Bridgeton site has been dealing with an exothermic reaction that first occurred in 2010 and continues to smolder: Essentially, an underground fire threatens to spread to West Lake, which would send radioactive ash into the air for miles around, depending on wind direction and containment. Emergency response plans have been issued and notices have gone out to nearby residents, but the fact that a fire is burning so close to radioactive waste has alarmed local advocacy groups like Just Moms STL for years. Residents who live downwind from the hazardous material have long tried to make this a public issue, and as Ray Hartmann wrote for Riverfront Times , \"The same authorities who say they were blindsided by the latest discovery of waste are some of the same ones who have assured residents that the waste won't catch fire.\" Bush has long been committed to the efforts of Just Moms STL.

While West Lake contains World War II-era radioactive waste, the Bridgeton site has been dealing with an exothermic reaction that first occurred in 2010 and continues to smolder: Essentially, an underground fire threatens to spread to West Lake, which would send radioactive ash into the air for miles around, depending on wind direction and containment. Emergency response plans have been issued and notices have gone out to nearby residents, but the fact that a fire is burning so close to radioactive waste has alarmed local advocacy groups like Just Moms STL for years. Residents who live downwind from the hazardous material have long tried to make this a public issue, and as Ray Hartmann wrote for Riverfront Times , \"The same authorities who say they were blindsided by the latest discovery of waste are some of the same ones who have assured residents that the waste won't catch fire.\" Bush has long been committed to the efforts of Just Moms STL.

L ouis, M o. -According to a Harvard study , transportation is the single most important factor in an individual's ability to escape poverty. In July 2022, a one-in-1,000-year flooding event hit St. Louis, dumping 25 percent of the normal yearly rainfall on the city in 12 hours. 1 The July deluge caused $18 million in damages to St. Louis's MetroLink light rail network. Whole trains, station elevators, miles of track, and signal houses took significant damage. \"Homes were flooded,\" Representative Cori Bush said in September , 2 \"people lost vehicles and became displaced. That's happened in Georgia , and in Rhode Island too. And in Jackson, Mississippi , a predominantly Black community has no access to clean water. This isn't happening in a community that's affluent.\" 3 Missouri's Bi-State Metro Transit agency requested $22 million in emergency funds, which sent Representative Bush's office on a five-month campaign. \"People told us it couldn't happen,\" Bush told The Nation , \"but I remember being out in the flood water. I was in-district. I just remember it was coming down so hard and so fast, and on social media, we started to see people in trouble in the inner city of St. Louis, and we hit the street.\" 4 Partnering with outgoing Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt, Bush's team organized with other Democratic members of Congress whose districts were also in need of climate-disaster funding. New York delegation members Jamaal Bowman, Jerrold Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Richard Torres, Carolyn Maloney, and Nydia Velazquez requested $75.67 million for the state's Metropolitan Transit Authority-repairs were needed after severe damage from 2021 Hurricanes Ida and Heri-as well as for Puerto Rico's decimated infrastructure from Hurricane Fiona in 2022. Bush threatened to withhold her year-end budget vote unless this nationwide climate disaster funding was approved. \"This was not politics as usual,\" Bush said. \"I couldn't vote for a package that didn't include funds for St. Louis.\" 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer In January 2022, Bush won. President Biden's year-end omnibus budget approved $213.9 million through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Climate Relief Fund (49 USC 5324). The aid is spread across four years, and will address an enormous backlog of needed investment across the country, including the 2022 flood damage in St. Louis. \"The best way to describe it is that that fund was going to have zero dollars in it,\" Bush said. \"We didn't know that we would get it done, our office was working hard, and we were up against time.\" 6 Current Issue View our current issue The Climate Relief Fund repairs light rail, bus networks, subway tunnels, water taxis, ferry operations, and other transit systems across the country that have been damaged or destroyed by cataclysmic weather such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. In the coming months, eligible transit providers with disaster claims for 2017, 2020, 2021, and 2022 can apply for funding. \"We're talking about emergency relief funds,\" Bush said. \"This is an area we had to push a lot, and center St. Louis, and center people riding the Metro system.\" 7 Yearly climate disasters are rapidly increasing in frequency and magnitude because of global warming. In 2017, Hurricane Irma became the harshest system to hit the US since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. That year, the 2017 FTA Climate Relief Fund was $0. 8 \"We know it's a class issue,\" Bush told The Nation . \"Lots of folks in Congress have never had to rely on a transit system. People have work, doctor appointments, child care. They shouldn't have to worry about this.\" 9 T he story of the FTA funding is about standing in place rather than losing ground, which often reflects the larger state of US public transit. After years of neglect, the multibillion-dollar public transit repair backlog is also being addressed in President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)-two of the biggest transportation bills of the decade. 10 The infrastructure bill touts $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years, and aims to modernize systems while repairing \"24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement.\" 11 The IRA is the United States' first major investment in climate change mitigation, focusing on tax credits, loans, and grants , as well as \"billions to modernize the electric grid, build a nationwide network of electric vehicle chargers, strengthen the battery supply chain, expand public transit and passenger rail.\" 12 But climate experts and transit engineers agree that vehicle electrification is an inadequate response to both global warming and moving people around, which is why Bush has centered public transit in her legislative efforts. 13 St. Louis's MetroLink is scheduled for a long-overdue North-South expansion , and in December of 2022, alongside fellow House Democrats, Bush introduced the Bus Rapid Transit Act and the Light Rail Transit Act , with the goal of transforming public transit in St. Louis and across the country to \"make getting around our communities more equitable,\" the representative said. The bills aim to jump-start new systems and improve existing programs while creating new jobs, reducing emissions, and improving connectivity. 14 While the Biden administration has made progress, global carbon emissions need to decrease by 45 percent by 2030 if we are to reach \"net zero\" by 2050, and the US transportation sector is the largest contributor to CO 2 emissions . While US carbon output has fallen since the mid-2000s, it has not decreased as quickly as our European counterparts'. 15 Roads, highways, and car infrastructure continue to consume vast resources, as in Missouri Governor Mike Parson's proposal to improve Interstate 70 to the tune of $859 million-made despite expert consensus that bigger roads and additional lanes only make traffic worse , and cement production requires massive CO 2 emissions. 16 \"I think we need a new era of enormous public investment,\" Bush said. \"If these crazy climate floods are possible, we have to imagine new possibilities for how we respond. We spend billions and billions on weapons of war, and act like it's so hard to pay for trains.\" 17\n\nThe July deluge caused $18 million in damages to St. Louis's MetroLink light rail network.

That campaign was mounted by groups that support Israel's devastating, ten-month assault on the Palestinian enclave, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the United Democracy Project, AIPAC's super PAC.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to Gaza has been so extreme that the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has applied for arrest warrants against the Israeli leader-as well as leaders of the Hamas, the Palestinian group that was responsible for the horrific October 7 attacks on Israeli kibbutzim and a music festival-on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush became the second prominent ceasefire supporter to be defeated this summer, after New York Democrat Jamaal Bowman lost in a late June primary that saw even higher levels of spending by pro-Israel groups. Yet, in the same election cycle that Bowman and Bush were defeated, two of the House's most prominent backers of a ceasefire-New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib -were easily renominated. And, in fact, most congressional backers of a ceasefire have been or will be renominated and reelected.\n\nWhat made the difference in the cases of Bowman and Bush was massive spending by outside groups, many of which have been funded by frequent Republican donors, noted Justice Democrats, a group that backed Bush.\n\n\"Cori was our first Justice Democrat because she embodied the change we wanted to see in the Democratic Party-working class people representing working class districts. That power-of everyday people to transform what we can expect from our political system is such a threat to right-wing power, corporate interests, and AIPAC's influence in Congress that a coalition of Republican-funded Super PACs had to spend over $12 million to even have a chance at defeating it,\" Justice Democrats said on X.\n\n\"It's time for the whole of our Party to unite against the influence of big money in politics, end record-breaking primaries funded by corporate Super PACs, and transform our electoral political system to put everyday people back at the center of our democracy-not billionaires,\" Justice Democrats added.\n\nBeth Miller, the political director for Jewish Voice for Peace Action PAC, responded to the result along similar lines.\n\n\"Extremist, pro-genocide groups like AIPAC are losing the war for public opinion, so now they're buying elections,\" said Miller. \"We are proud to have supported a champion for justice like Congresswoman Bush and will continue organizing to overcome anti-democratic, pro-war Super PACs and to build a government that actually serves all people-no exceptions.\"\n\nTuesday's result was a political setback for Bush, an activist turned candidate who has won and lost elections in the past, and who may well win again in the future. But whatever her electoral trajectory may be, history will record that Bush won the moral high ground many months ago, when she put aside political calculations and did what she knew was right.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack, as The Nation noted earlier this year in recognizing Bush's courageous approach to some of the most politically challenging issues of our time, the representative quickly condemned the targeting of civilians and pledged to aid constituents who had loved ones in the region. But unlike most members of Congress, the Missouri Democrat didn't stop there. She called for \"an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation to prevent further loss of life.\" And she said, \"Violations of human rights do not justify more violations of human rights, and a military response will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike.\"\n\nThat was not a position that most members of Congress, even most progressives, were willing to take at the time. It earned Bush sharp rebukes and the threat of a 2024 primary challenge that everyone assumed would be financed by the political arms of AIPAC and other groups that support Israeli hard-liners. Yet, Bush remained steadfast. As Israel's assault on Gaza intensified, she emerged as the chief sponsor of the House \"Ceasefire Now\" resolution , which called on the Biden administration to exhaust every diplomatic tool to end the assault on Gaza-an assault that, as of this week, has left 36,600 Palestinians dead and 91,469 Palestinians wounded , that has seen much of the civilian infrastructure of Gaza destroyed, and that has led to accusations of genocide before the ICC. Bush and the resolution's cosponsors, such as Michigan's Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, were harshly criticized, often by their fellow Democrats. But they persevered, creating a congressional touchstone for the mass movement that seeks to persuade the US to stop giving Netanyahu and his right-wing allies a blank check.\n\n\"We can't bomb our way to peace, equality, and freedom,\" explained the representative from Missouri on October 16. \"With thousands of lives lost and millions more at stake, we need a ceasefire now.\"\n\nTen months later, many prominent Democrats echo those sentiments. Even Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's nominee for president, now says , \"It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nAfter meeting with the Israeli leader last month, Harris announced, \"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this [ceasefire] deal done.\"\n\n\"So, to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace,\" added the vice president, \"I see you and I hear you.\"\n\nCori Bush may have lost her seat in the House in Tuesday's Missouri primary. But, now and in the future, Bush will remain the representative who stood on the right side of history.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

A congressional ethics inquiry dismissed charges that the arrangement was inappropriate.\n\nBy Luke Broadwater and Catie Edmondson\n\nReporting from the Capitol\n\nThe Justice Department is conducting an investigation into whether Representative Cori Bush mishandled campaign funds, including when she hired her romantic partner - who is now her husband - to provide her with security services.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics investigated the security arrangement by Ms. Bush, a Democrat from Missouri, last year. The office voted to recommend dismissal of the allegations after concluding that her husband, Cortney Merritts, had performed \"bona fide\" security work and did not appear to have been overpaid, and that Ms. Bush faced a level of threats that justified the work.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Bush said that she was \"fully cooperating\" with the Justice Department investigation.\n\n\"Since before I was sworn into office, I have endured relentless threats to my physical safety and life,\" Ms. Bush said. \"As a rank-and-file member of Congress, I am not entitled to personal protection by the House, and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services. I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services. Any reporting that I have used federal funds for personal security is simply false.\"\n\nThe House Ethics Committee is also investigating the matter, Ms. Bush said.\n\nMs. Bush has spoken out about the death threats she has received on Capitol Hill. She spent more on security than any other member of the House in the months after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol.\n\nPeople familiar with the investigation, who spoke about it on the condition of anonymity, said federal prosecutors were asking questions similar to those asked by the congressional investigators about Ms. Bush's security expenditures and the involvement of Mr. Merritts.

She was one of two Democrats who voted in January against a resolution to bar members of Hamas and anyone who participated in the attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 from the United States.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times , she declined to call Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\n\"Would they qualify to me as a terrorist organization? Yes. But do I know that? Absolutely not,\" Ms. Bush said. \"I have no communication with them. All I know is that we were considered terrorists, we were considered Black identity extremists and all we were doing was trying to get peace. I'm not trying to compare us, but that taught me to be careful about labeling if I don't know.\" Later, a spokeswoman walked back the comment, saying: \"The congresswoman knows Hamas is a terrorist organization.\"\n\nAnd while her race ultimately had little to do with Israel - abortion is illegal in Missouri and crime is high in St. Louis, where downtown is overrun by boarded-up storefronts, giving voters more pressing concerns - her positions and votes regarding the country and its war in Gaza made her a prime target for AIPAC.\n\nSome of the spending against her highlighted her vote against President Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure law. She opposed the bill because many initiatives liberals wanted, such as universal family leave and free community college, were severed from the legislative package to attract the backing of Republicans, whose votes were needed for it to clear Congress.\n\nThe race turned heated, and Ms. Bush refused to debate Mr. Bell, who has said he supports the United States sending military aid to Israel. \"We do have to stand by our allies,\" he said.\n\nMs. Bush, in an earlier interview, said she would not debate him because \"I'm not going to platform a Republican. If he was not taking all of this Republican money for a Democratic district, then there would be a conversation.\"\n\nMr. Bell, in his challenge, argued that Ms. Bush had been ineffective in Washington, prioritizing her \"squad\" fame in Congress over local results.\n\n\"It was a no-brainer; it's a good piece of legislation,\" Mr. Bell said of the infrastructure bill, noting that it had brought hundreds of millions of dollars into the district for jobs, roads and bridges and clean water. \"She had her own protest vote as opposed to what's in the best interest of her district.\"\n\nMike Baker\n\nReporting from Seattle\n\nTwo years ago, Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez won a seat in Congress in Washington State, beating her Republican rival, Joe Kent, by less than 3,000 votes .\n\nThe two politicians are now set for a rematch in November, according to The Associated Press, after pulling ahead of other candidates in Tuesday's open primary election for the Third Congressional District in the southwestern part of the state. Washington State's vote-by-mail system means that many ballots are still to be counted.\n\nMs. Gluesenkamp Perez, a former auto-repair shop owner, has established herself in Congress as an independent voice , splitting with her party on key issues. Last month, she joined Republicans in voting to condemn Vice President Kamala Harris's handling of the southern border. She has so far declined to endorse Ms. Harris for the presidency.\n\nMr. Kent, a retired Green Beret, has the support of former President Donald J. Trump and has joined Mr. Trump in falsely claiming that the 2020 election was rigged. He advocated pardoning those who were accused of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, describing them as political prisoners.\n\nThe race between Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez and Mr. Kent is considered one of the most competitive in the country and will help determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives.\n\n*Top two candidates advance\n                to general election.  Source: The Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Baker\n\nReporting from Seattle\n\nWashington State's closely watched race for governor will be a contest between two candidates known for their backgrounds in law enforcement.\n\nBob Ferguson, the state's Democratic attorney general, and Dave Reichert, a former sheriff who served as a Republican in Congress, emerged as the top two vote-getters in the state's open primary election Tuesday night. Though the state's vote-by-mail system means many ballots remain to be counted, the overall outcome was not expected to change.\n\nDemocrats have won every race for governor in the past four decades, including Gov. Jay Inslee, who is not seeking re-election after three consecutive terms in office. But this year, though the polls suggest that Mr. Ferguson is favored, the race is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country.\n\nWith drug overdoses soaring across the state and a sharp rise in homicides in Seattle, the two top candidates spent much of the primary campaign emphasizing public safety. Mr. Reichert has spoken of his former work as the sheriff of King County who hunted down the Green River Killer . Mr. Ferguson has run ads saying he wants to hire more law enforcement officers. \"Public safety is my top priority,\" he says in one of them.\n\nMr. Ferguson has criticized Mr. Reichert's record on abortion, including his votes in Congress in favor of banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. Reichert has sought to distance himself from those votes, saying he would not change Washington State law on the issue, which permits abortions up until the point of viability or to protect the health of the mother.\n\nIn Washington, all candidates for governor compete in a single open primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation.\n\nErnesto Londoño\n\nLt. Gov. Mike Kehoe of Missouri won the Republican primary for governor on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, giving him the upper hand in a contest in November to succeed Mike Parson.\n\nMr. Kehoe, 62, defeated two rivals who portrayed themselves as more conservative alternatives to the current state leadership. They included Missouri's secretary of state, Jay Ashcroft, the son of the former Missouri governor and U.S. senator and attorney general John Ashcroft. Jay Ashcroft finished third behind State Senator Bill Eigel, who pledged to act aggressively to expel all undocumented immigrants from Missouri.\n\nMr. Parson, 68, who has served as governor since June 2018 and remains broadly popular , is barred by term limits from running this year. He endorsed Mr. Kehoe last month.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, State Representative Crystal Quade, the House minority leader, defeated Mike Hamra, a businessman.\n\nDemocrats had long been competitive in national and statewide races in Missouri. The state had a Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, as recently as 2017 and a Democrat in the U.S. Senate, Claire McCaskill, as recently as 2019. Former President Barack Obama narrowly lost Missouri in 2008.\n\nBut the election of former President Donald J. Trump in 2016 made clear that Missouri had turned into a solidly red state. That means that the winner of the Republican primary is widely expected to become the next governor, said Daniel Butler, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne factor that could upend conventional wisdom in the race is a ballot measure that voters are likely to consider in November, which could enshrine a right to abortion in Missouri's Constitution. Similar initiatives have helped boost Democrats in other red-leaning states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nProfessor Butler said the abortion measure made the contest for the governor's race in November less predictable than it would have been, and the Democrats in the race had expressed hope that the measure could help improve their chances in the general election. Nearly all abortions are illegal in Missouri.\n\nAll three Republican candidates for governor had said they opposed abortion, although Mr. Kehoe said last year that he would consider amending the state's law to include exceptions for rape and incest. During a recent debate that Mr. Kehoe did not attend, Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Eigel signaled support for a stricter ban than what Mr. Kehoe favored.\n\nThe two Democrats running for governor supported legalizing the right to abortion.\n\nMr. Kehoe, a former car salesman, presented himself as a self-made businessman raised by a single mother who was attuned to the needs and aspirations of working class voters.\n\nMr. Ashcroft, 51, entered the race with significant name recognition as the son of one of the best-known political figures in the state. He campaigned on a promise to cut taxes and government spending, and prevent Chinese firms from buying farmland in Missouri.\n\nMr. Eigel, 46, gained attention during the final stretch of the race by running ads presenting him as the toughest candidate on immigration. One featured a Spanish-speaking interpreter who appeared to panic halfway through the ad as Mr. Eigel sternly declared \"we're throwing them in jail, and sending them back where they came from.\"\n\nIn late July, Mr. Trump endorsed all three, preventing any one of the candidates from receiving a singular boost from his support.\n\n\"Choose any one of them,\" Mr. Trump wrote . \"You can't go wrong!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheodore Schleifer\n\nThe new Harris-Walz ticket on Tuesday raced to collect more than $20 million from energized Democrats - including from some big donors who had tried to persuade Vice President Kamala Harris to choose someone else as her running mate.\n\nThe momentum from small donors was undeniable. The progressive fund-raising platform ActBlue recorded an average of $3 million an hour in the half-day following the news of Ms. Harris's choice of Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, making it one of the biggest days for Democratic digital fund-raising of the 2024 cycle.\n\nBut Ms. Harris did not seem to prioritize fund-raising chops as part of her decision. Mr. Walz does not have deep fund-raising relationships with large donors, relative to his rival contenders. And his selection threatened to upset some of the prospective givers who had lobbied behind the scenes for other prospective vice-presidential candidates.\n\nOn Tuesday, some of those donors allied with other Democrats said privately they were disappointed and heartbroken that their favored candidate was not chosen.\n\nBoth Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, and Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, had committed donors who were pushing for their inclusion. The Shapiro team gradually lost confidence in their candidate's chances throughout the last weekend after his Sunday interview with Ms. Harris, according to a person briefed on the Shapiro team's thinking. Some of his donors expected his selection.\n\nBut spirits improved by the end of the day, especially once Mr. Walz took the stage at a rally with Ms. Harris in Philadelphia.\n\nWhitney Tilson, a former hedge fund executive and longtime Democratic donor who had pushed for President Biden to step aside from the Democratic ticket, said he had found that decision by Mr. Biden to be an \"existential\" one. Ms. Harris's decision, though? \"Not existential.\"\n\nMr. Tilson said he had been leaning toward Mr. Shapiro or Senator Mark Kelly. But, he wrote to his network on Tuesday: \"I'm fine with this.\"\n\nMr. Walz was a middling fund-raiser as a congressman, raising about $2 million a cycle. A few wealthy Minnesotans, such as Alida Messinger, a Rockefeller heir and an ex-wife of a previous Minnesota governor, have backed his rise in state politics. In December, he was elected the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, a role that has briefly introduced him to some top givers. And in recent weeks, he has built some fans among major progressive donors in networks such as the Movement Voter Project and Way to Win, who publicly pushed for his selection.\n\nAnd he has worked the hustings. He has spoken to several constellations of major donors, according to people familiar with his activities, including a well-regarded interview on Friday with a group of 60 contributors from networks like the Democracy Alliance and the Leadership Now Project.\n\nMr. Walz's onetime rivals are at work, too. Several people who had been considered possible running mates for Ms. Harris are continuing their own fund-raising for the ticket, according to invitations reviewed by The Times: Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina is leading a virtual reception for Lawyers and Friends for Harris on Aug. 12. And Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan governor, is slated to hold a fund-raiser in Oakland County, Mich., with Nancy Pelosi on Aug. 14.\n\nAnd Ms. Harris, who is planning to spend much of the week with Mr. Walz, is going to San Francisco on Sunday morning for a fund-raiser at a hotel in the city's Nob Hill neighborhood, according to invitations distributed Tuesday. Mr. Walz could be in tow.\n\nThe selection of Mr. Walz does present some challenges: One campaign-finance issue for the campaign will be navigating the pay-for-play rules regarding how employees of certain financial institutions can donate to the ticket. That's because Mr. Walz is a sitting governor. There are regulations that limit whether investors and bankers who do business with a state - in this case, Minnesota - can also donate to support an elected official from that state when they run nationally.\n\nStill, in such a short campaign, Mr. Walz may be expected to play an expanded role in presidential fund-raising, given the demands on Ms. Harris's schedule.\n\nShaila Dewan\n\nThe Missouri attorney general, Andrew Bailey, won the primary election on Tuesday to be Republican Party's candidate for attorney general in the November general election, The Associated Press said.\n\nMr. Bailey, who was appointed by Gov. Mike Parson in 2022, now seeks a full four-year term in a post has been a steppingstone for his predecessors, Eric Schmitt and Josh Hawley, both of whom are sitting U.S. senators.\n\nIn his 19 months as the state's attorney general, Mr. Bailey has plunged the office into heated legal and political fights. He has sought to keep prisoners locked up after their exonerations, withheld approval of a ballot initiative to restore abortion rights, and tried to restrict gender-affirming health care for adults and children. He also tried to sue New York State over its criminal prosecution of former President Donald J. Trump and mounted legal challenges to President Biden's policies on student loan forgiveness, immigration, gun regulation and other issues.\n\nEven so, Mr. Bailey spent much of the primary race jockeying with his opponent, Will Scharf, over who was more loyal to Mr. Trump. Mr. Scharf is one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, appearing before the Supreme Court on his behalf in the presidential immunity case that was decided in Mr. Trump's favor last month.\n\nMr. Trump endorsed both candidates , saying on his social media platform, Truth Social, \"Both have fearlessly confronted the Radical Left's destructive Lawfare and Weaponization of 'Justice' with Great Wisdom, Courage, and Strength!\"\n\nMr. Bailey, who Mr. Scharf has accused of being soft on crime, routinely opposed efforts by prisoners to prove their innocence or to leave prison once they had done so. This summer he delayed the release of two exonerated prisoners, Sandra Hemme and Christopher Dunn , and sought unsuccessfully to block a hearing on DNA evidence that pointed to the innocence of a death row prisoner, Marcellus Williams, who is scheduled for execution in September.\n\nMr. Bailey, 43, grew up in Missouri and earned his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Missouri. Mr. Scharf, 38, is from New York and is a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School. A clerkship for a federal judge brought him to Missouri.\n\nNeither candidate had previously run for office.\n\nMr. Bailey will face Elad Gross, a Democrat, who ran unopposed in his party's primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Weisman\n\nRepresentative Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, and former Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican, will square off for an open Senate seat in Michigan in what is likely to be one of the tightest and most closely watched Senate campaigns in the country.\n\nAs expected, Ms. Slotkin and Mr. Rogers easily prevailed in their Senate primaries on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, setting up a remarkably even contest for the fall.\n\nBoth held the same Central Michigan House district around Lansing and East Lansing. Both made their names in national security, Mr. Rogers as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Ms. Slotkin with her work for the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Department, State Department and White House National Security Council.\n\nAnd in vying for the seat of Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democratic stalwart who is retiring, both still need to work to broaden their appeal in a pivotal battleground where neither has held statewide office.\n\nForecasters such as the nonpartisan Cook Political Report initially favored Democrats to hold the seat, but President Biden's struggles in Michigan - fueled in part by Israel's war in Gaza - shifted the Senate contest to a pure tossup.\n\nThe most recent polling gives Ms. Slotkin a slight edge, consistent with other swing states where Democratic candidates have run ahead of their presidential nominee. But Michigan holds a specific challenge to Ms. Slotkin. She has made her name and reputation as a defense-minded Democrat both in the executive branch of government and in Congress. She is also Jewish and pro-Israel.\n\nMr. Biden's staunch support for Israel created headwinds that may yet still affect Vice President Kamala Harris, whose rapid ascent to the top of the ticket was made official Monday night.\n\nSignificant numbers of Arab American and Muslim voters in and around Detroit registered their dismay with the Biden administration's Middle East policies by voting for \"uncommitted\" delegates in the Michigan presidential primary in February.\n\nMore than 13 percent of Democratic primary voters chose \"uncommitted\" statewide, rather than voting for Mr. Biden. In Wayne County, where more than half of the state's Arab population lives, 79 percent of the vote went to \"uncommitted\" in majority-Arab districts. Ms. Slotkin has shown bipartisan appeal in the last three House elections by winning her swing House district, but Democrats have traditionally won statewide in Michigan by running up the score in Greater Detroit.\n\nRepublicans will try to dent Ms. Slotkin's image of moderation by tying her to Ms. Harris, whom they are portraying as \"dangerously liberal.\" Ms. Slotkin will attend Ms. Harris's rally in Detroit on Wednesday night after avoiding Mr. Biden's most recent appearance in the state.\n\nMr. Rogers will use former President Donald J. Trump's calls for \"America First\" and an end to U.S. adventurism overseas to temper his own past support for a robust foreign policy, including in the Middle East, Republican strategists said.\n\nBut Mr. Rogers has his own problems. He has not held elective office since 2015, and since leaving Congress, he has loosened his connection to Michigan, moving to Florida and registering to vote in Coral Gables .\n\nHe moved back in 2023 , but even before the primary on Tuesday, Democrats had begun tarring him as an out-of-touch lobbyist who cashed in on his ties to Capitol Hill for foreign governments, and then moved to Florida. His votes against abortion rights in the House will most likely be a mainstay of Democratic attacks.\n\nBoth Ms. Slotkin and Mr. Rogers faced opponents from the wings of their party in the primaries. Ms. Slotkin's opponent, Hill Harper, was an actor on the television show \"The Good Doctor\" and ran as an outspoken progressive. The Republican primary started off as a seemingly competitive battle royale, but Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Rogers, then prominent contenders such as former Representative Peter Meijer dropped out. That left Mr. Rogers with just one significant challenger, former Representative Justin Amash, a libertarian-minded conservative who was chased from the Republican Party and then from Congress over his fierce criticism of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Amash's Quixotic third-party run for president in 2020 went nowhere, as did his attempt to rejoin the Republican Party and vie for the Senate.\n\nMaggie Astor and Chris Cameron\n\nRepublicans wasted no time in criticizing Gov. Tim Walz after Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate. But one of the Trump campaign's attack lines landed awkwardly.\n\nMr. Walz's \"policies to allow convicted felons to vote\" in Minnesota are evidence that he \"is obsessed with spreading California's dangerously liberal agenda far and wide,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign.\n\nBut critics of the former president were quick to point out that, if not for such policies, Mr. Trump himself would be barred from voting.\n\nA jury in New York convicted Mr. Trump of 34 felonies this year for falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star. While he is trying to overturn the verdict, it remains in place, and he is scheduled to be sentenced in September.\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House aide who is now a co-host of \"The View,\" wondered on social media, \"Does he not believe he should be able to vote for himself?\"\n\nFormer Representative Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican who has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump, wrote : \"Big reminder that Trump is a convicted felon with indicted felonies still to go to trial ... and wants to pardon hundreds of violent Jan 6 felons but yeah, talk about felons, Mr. First ever nominated felon.\"\n\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, which, when it comes to whether felons can vote, defers to the laws of the state where a conviction took place. New York allows people with felony convictions to vote unless they are in prison, so Mr. Trump can cast a ballot unless he is incarcerated on Election Day.\n\nStricter laws in many Republican-led states would stop him from voting until he had completed all terms of his sentence, including parole or probation - or, in some cases, require further action to have his voting rights restored even after he completed his sentence.\n\nMs. Leavitt said: \"President Trump is eligible to vote. This does not apply to him at all.\"\n\nA bill Mr. Walz signed last year made Minnesota's policy similar to the New York one, under which Mr. Trump is eligible: It restored voting rights to felons who had completed their prison sentences, rather than disenfranchising them until they completed parole or probation. Felons still lose their voting rights in Minnesota while they are incarcerated.\n\nMore than 20 states have policies similar to the ones in Minnesota and New York.\n\nFlorida's laws are stricter: If it applied its own standards instead of New York's standards to Mr. Trump, a sentence of parole or probation would disenfranchise him this November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristina Capecchi\n\nAt the Lutheran church in South St. Paul, Minn., holding a National Night Out event, pulled pork and root beer floats were on the menu.\n\n\"People don't really talk politics,\" says Louie Greengard, 66, a retired carpenter who said he is a supporter of Gov. Tim Walz. \"This guy is just a regular guy. And I'm from a big union family.\"\n\nHis wife, Luanne, a 63-year-old retired X-ray technician, chimes in. \"He's the little guy. He gives a big ray of hope.\"\n\nKatie Glueck\n\nFor years, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania has said that his Jewish faith drives his commitment to public service.\n\nBut as he wrapped up a fiery speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday, after the conclusion of a vice-presidential search process that prompted intense public scrutiny of his views on Israel, Mr. Shapiro's familiar references to his religious background took on a raw new resonance. And he seemed to sound a note of defiance.\n\n\"I am proud of my faith,\" he said, his voice rising, speaking slowly and deliberately to sustained applause.\n\nMr. Shapiro's comments came as part of a well-received speech welcoming Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Throughout, Mr. Shapiro praised the ticket effusively.\n\nBut the moment followed an ugly final phase of Ms. Harris's search.\n\nMr. Shapiro's positions on the Middle East , his allies have noted, are well within the Democratic mainstream, and were not markedly different from other vice-presidential candidates under consideration.\n\nYet Mr. Shapiro - dubbed \"Genocide Josh\" by some activists - drew outsize attention on the subject, his supporters said, and some saw that focus as driven by antisemitism.\n\nLeft-wing and pro-Palestinian activists and other critics vehemently denied that, saying they objected because they saw Mr. Shapiro as too sympathetic to Israel and overly critical of campus Gaza-war protests, not because of his faith.\n\nSome Democrats worried that elevating Mr. Shapiro to the ticket would reignite the battles raging in the party over Israel and the Gaza war - divisions that still exist, but had been more muted after President Biden said he would not seek re-election.\n\nFor others - especially for some Jewish Democrats who have struggled with their place in the party against that backdrop - the spotlight on Mr. Shapiro was painful.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Shapiro emphasized the role his faith - which he did not highlight by name - has played in his public life.\n\n\"I lean on my family, and I lean on my faith, which calls me to serve,\" Mr. Shapiro said.\n\nSoon after, he was back to stumping for the Democratic ticket.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nThe Harris campaign has unveiled a new line of Harris-Walz merchandise on their official campaign website, including a camo hat much like the ones Walz has been seen wearing, including during the phone call this morning in which Walz accepted Harris's offer of becoming her running mate.\n\nWhen I called @Tim_Walz this morning to ask him to join our campaign, I shared my deep level of respect for him and the work we've done together. We're going to unify this country and we're going to win. Let's go get this done. pic.twitter.com/EcqZ497lyk\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate Selig and Ernesto Londoño\n\nGov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a longtime teacher and former congressman, and now Kamala Harris's vice-presidential pick, was also once briefly a seventh-grade basketball coach, a role in which he displayed some of his capacity for exceeding expectations.\n\nOne member of the team even recalled watching in awe as Mr. Walz rose above the rim at one practice and dunked the basketball.\n\n\"We were all shocked,\" said the team member, Nathaniel Hood, now 40. \"Like, 'Wow, I had no idea Coach Walz was so cool.'\"\n\nThe team learned a few days later that Mr. Walz had secretly lowered the hoop.\n\nStill, some former students said, that fit perfectly with the Mr. Walz they knew decades ago at Mankato West High School in Minnesota: a down-to-earth teacher who was just as likely to gently prank a student as he was to dispense a few crucial words of wisdom that could alter their life.\n\nSome of these students have since contributed to Mr. Walz's rise in the political world, by knocking on doors and campaigning to get him elected. \"I think we're almost universally pumped,\" said Emily Falenczykowski-Scott, 41.\n\nMr. Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, moved from Nebraska to Mankato in 1996, with Mr. Walz teaching social studies and coaching the football team.\n\nMr. Hood said Mr. Walz kept his political beliefs out of the classroom, even when he was leading discussions on political subjects. The seeds of his future as a politician, Mr. Hood said, were more visible in his work as a defensive coordinator for the varsity football team.\n\nMr. Walz helped coach the team to its first state title in 1999, so hopes were high when Mr. Hood joined in 2000. But the team did not live up to the expectations. That created a lot of demand for rousing speeches from Mr. Walz, which were his specialty, Mr. Hood said.\n\n\"Think of any of those sports movies where the team is down going into the fourth quarter, and all it takes to turn the game around is a motivational speech from the coach,\" he said. \"That was his bread and butter.\"\n\nIn addition to his teaching and coaching roles, Mr. Walz also led a two-week trip to China every other summer for the students at Mankato West.\n\nMs. Falenczykowski-Scott went on the trip in 2000, and didn't know much about China before going, she said. But while on a river cruise in Guilin, a city in southern China, she remembered turning to Mr. Walz and saying, \"I want to keep doing this.\"\n\nShe said Mr. Walz told her exactly what she needed to do: attend the University of Wisconsin, major in Chinese and then move to China.\n\n\"And sure enough, I did it,\" said Ms. Falenczykowski-Scott, who has since lived in China, Namibia and Bangladesh and now lives in Minnesota. \"He truly changed my life.\"\n\nAnd when Mr. Walz decided to run for Congress in the 2006 election, some of his students signed up to knock on doors, even though it seemed nearly inconceivable that a first-time Democratic candidate could win in a red district against an entrenched incumbent.\n\n\"This is farm country, it's very conservative,\" said Nicole Griensewic, 41, who was in Mr. Walz's geography class in the late 1990s and volunteered for his campaign. \"It had been known as a Republican district for so long, so it was like, 'Who is this guy?'\"\n\nWhen Mr. Walz first ran for governor in 2018, Mr. Hood was among those pitching in. All these years later, he still calls the governor \"Mr. Walz,\" like he did at school.\n\n\"He'll say, 'Just call me Tim,'\" Mr. Hood said. \"But I still stick with Mr. Walz, because that's how I know him.\"\n\nChris Cameron\n\nThe Trump campaign is canceling two events headlined by JD Vance in North Carolina on Thursday \"due to severe weather forecasts,\" adding that they would be rescheduled as soon as possible. The two events were going to be held in Raleigh and in Oakboro, near Charlotte.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nThe Harris campaign has not made an announcement about their own campaign event in North Carolina that day. Remnants of Debby, a tropical storm that has flooded the Southeast, is forecast to make a second landfall on Thursday.\n\nJon Hurdle\n\nSandy Rothman, who lives in Philadelphia, came out of the rally saying it had \"great energy.\"\n\nShe said the audience seemed to instantly get over any disappointment that their own governor, Josh Shapiro, was passed over. Ms. Rothman said Walz was \"the safer choice.\" She said Shapiro had \"controversial\" positions on the war in Gaza and angered some donors with his policies on school vouchers.\n\nJon Hurdle\n\nPeter Urscheler, 40, from Phoenixville, Pa., carried a \"Kamala\" placard as he walked down Broad Street after the rally. He said he enjoyed the remarks by Walz, the new vice presidential nominee.\n\n\"He just has the right sense of values that we need,\" Urscheler said of Walz. \"He stands where most Americans do. We want common-sense gun laws, but we also want to make sure that we are socially conscious of the most vulnerable in our society.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nDonald Trump has in the last 24 hours floated a new derisive nickname for Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her \"Kamabla\" in at least five posts online since Monday. He has long mispronounced Harris's name, and during his primary race he repeatedly butchered the name of Nikki Haley , another woman of Indian heritage.\" He hasn't explained the new nickname, but the mispronunciation fits with his other efforts to cast her as an outsider.\n\nChristina Capecchi\n\nIn Inver Grove Heights, Minn., where a Methodist church in this St. Paul suburb hosted a National Night Out gathering, volunteers discussed their thoughts on Gov. Tim Walz. Bill Short, left, a 75-year-old church volunteer and retired town clerk treasurer, said that \"when I think about Walz, I'm relaxed.\" He added: \"I smile. I think about an uncle.\"\n\nNicholas Nehamas\n\nVoters just got their first glimpse of what a Harris-Walz ticket could look like compared to the Biden-Harris one. My main takeaways: More energy. More humor. And less time trying to sell the country on the accomplishments of the Biden administration.\n\nKatie Rogers\n\nWalz is an emphatic messenger and is just really not afraid to Go There with the meme-ready jokes. And Harris does not seem like she minds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReid J. Epstein\n\nWalz just delivered a message for his supporters: \"We've got 91 days,\" he said. \"My God, that's easy.

That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up, so.\n\nNicholas Nehamas\n\nWalz's debate challenge was a not-very-sly allusion to a fabricated Internet joke about JD Vance and his relationship with couches. He is certainly leaning into the attack-dog role expected of a vice presidential candidate.\n\nMichael Barbaro\n\nHarris can barely suppress a laugh at Walz's couch joke. And I mean, barely.\n\nReid J. Epstein Erica L. Green and Katie Glueck\n\nReid J. Epstein and Erica L. Green reported from Philadelphia, and Katie Glueck from New York.\n\ntranscript\n\n\"To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was Coach. And in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: Vice President of the United States.\" \"Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy. Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us. First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service. He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself. Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD [Vance] studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a best seller trashing that community. Come on. That's not what middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy.\"\n\nAmerica's introduction to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota began with a half-hour of cheering for Vice President Kamala Harris and ended with some of the sharpest attacks Democrats have leveled against former President Donald J. Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nBefore a raucous crowd in Philadelphia, Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz presented the Minnesotan as a folksy former schoolteacher and football coach who had inspired his students, served in the military and improved his constituents' lives.\n\nBut it was his ability to deliver searing yet accessible attacks against their Republican opponents that won Mr. Walz a place on the national ticket, and during his first rally, he did not miss his marks.\n\n\"Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us,\" he said. \"First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service. He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThen came the dagger. \"Violent crime was up under Donald Trump,\" he said, before pausing for effect. \"That's not even counting the crimes he committed.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign's presentation of Mr. Walz brought an end to its two-week sprint to find a running mate, a process that typically takes months and involves a series of public tryouts. Instead, Ms. Harris's search for a partner took place largely behind closed doors.\n\nMs. Harris, in her remarks, hailed Mr. Walz as not only the governing partner she had sought but a person of decency who she said would set an example to inspire the nation.\n\n\"Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having and that every kid deserves,\" the vice president said. \"The kind of coach - because he's the kind of person - who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that's the kind of vice president he will be. And that's the kind of vice president America deserves.\"\n\nJust 40 days ago, President Biden was preparing to debate Mr. Trump in what his campaign described as the kickoff to the general election. But the president delivered a performance so alarming that his party exploded in revolt, ultimately pushing him out of the race just over two weeks ago.\n\nIn short order, Ms. Harris's emergence as the nominee has transformed what had been a Democratic Party depressed by the prospect of scrounging up votes for an unpopular 81-year-old candidate. Now the party is newly hopeful heading into the highly competitive homestretch of the election.\n\n\"The promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids - one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother, the other a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm - it's the promise of America,\" Ms. Harris said in Philadelphia. \"Because only in America - only in America - is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House.\"\n\nMr. Walz seemed almost overwhelmed as he took the stage to wild cheers. He spent the 30 minutes while Ms. Harris spoke alternating between bowing toward her and theatrical applause that had the effect of making him appear like a man who had just won the political lottery.\n\nWhen he finally took the microphone, his exultation was clear. \"Wow,\" he said, before offering another small bow.\n\nIn his speech, he praised Ms. Harris's career in law enforcement and as vice president, saying she had \"fought on the side of the American people\" and \"never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives.\"\n\nHe emphasized his blue-collar roots, growing up in small towns in Nebraska and spending summers working on his family farm, and described how joining the military had given him purpose.\n\nBut it was his prepared zingers against Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance that led to the biggest responses from the crowd, which the Harris campaign said had totaled about 12,000 people.\n\nMr. Walz accused Mr. Vance of being an inauthentic tribune of the white working-class Midwesterners he says he represents. Mr. Walz, who graduated from Chadron State College in Nebraska, mocked Mr. Vance's Ivy League education and Silicon Valley employment before effectively calling him a coward in front of a national television audience.\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy,\" Mr. Walz said, pausing again as he savored the attack line to come. \"That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up.\"\n\n(The line, for the blissfully uninitiated, was a wink-and-nod reference to a widely shared yet false social media claim about Mr. Vance and furniture.)\n\ntranscript\n\nJD Vance literally, literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda. [crowd boos] Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and then wrote a best seller trashing that community. Come on. That's not what middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy. That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up, so.\n\nMr. Walz catapulted himself from little-known Midwestern governor to a national Democratic star embraced by the party's progressive wing.\n\nHe created a catchphrase for liberals in labeling Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance as \"weird\" characters, going so far on Tuesday as to call them \"creepy and weird as hell.\" He delighted key elements of his party with punchy appearances on cable television and down-home videos on social media, along with his record of enacting liberal measures as governor.\n\nIn her introduction, Ms. Harris highlighted several of Mr. Walz's policy positions, many of which aligned with the Biden administration's, that she said demonstrated his willingness to stand up against attacks on freedom.\n\nAmong them was being the first governor in the country to sign a new law protecting reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He also signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years.\n\nMr. Walz cast his support for abortion rights, as many Democrats have, as a defense of personal freedom.\n\n\"In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices that they make,\" he said. \"Even if we wouldn't make the same choices for ourselves, there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.\"\n\nMr. Walz also shared his family's difficult experience with in vitro fertilization treatments, which have been targeted by conservatives in some states that moved to pass restrictive laws after the decision overturning Roe.\n\n\"I remember praying every night for a call for good news,\" he said, describing the pit in his stomach and the \"agony\" he had felt hoping that the treatments had worked.\n\nThis, he said, was why he and his wife named their daughter \"Hope.\"\n\nThe rally also had to deal with the thorny issue of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who was the runner-up to join Ms. Harris on the ticket and gave a fiery speech to help kick off the rally.\n\nMr. Shapiro warned about the prospect of a Trump-Vance White House and spoke warmly of Mr. Walz.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a great man,\" Mr. Shapiro said, adding that he was \"an outstanding governor,\" a \"great patriot\" and a \"dear friend.\"\n\n\"I'm going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America,\" Mr. Shapiro added.\n\nMr. Walz, in turn, said Mr. Shapiro could \"bring the fire\" and called him a \"visionary leader,\" telling the crowd, \"What a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro.\" He also praised Mr. Shapiro's ability to complete an interstate highway reconstruction last year. \"Everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy,\" Mr. Walz said.\n\nThe Harris campaign said that since Mr. Walz had been announced as the running mate, it had raised more than $20 million from supporters. It was one of its best fund-raising days this election cycle, the campaign said.\n\nDuring his speech, Mr. Walz tried to rally supporters for the three-month dash to November, telling them, \"We'll sleep when we're dead.\"\n\n\"Over those next 91 days, and every day in the White House, I'll have Vice President Harris's back,\" he said. \"And we'll have yours.\"\n\nNicholas Nehamas contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement"

LOUIS - Cori Bush , a progressive activist and a leader of the swelling protest movement for racial justice, toppled Representative William Lacy Clay Jr. of Missouri in a Democratic primary on Tuesday, notching the latest in a stunning string of upsets against the party establishment.\n\nMs. Bush, 44, had captured nearly 49 percent of the vote by late Tuesday evening compared with 45.5 percent for Mr. Clay, according to The Associated Press. She had tried and failed to unseat Mr. Clay in 2018, but this year rode a surge in support for more liberal, confrontational politics within the Democratic Party amid the coronavirus pandemic and the national outcry over festering racial inequities.\n\nMs. Bush's victory, which came on the same night that Missouri voters decided to expand Medicaid eligibility, was a significant milestone for insurgent progressive candidates and the groups, like Justice Democrats, that have backed them across the country. It showed that the same brand of politics that has helped young, liberal candidates of color unseat veteran party stalwarts in places like Massachusetts and New York could also resonate deep in the heartland against a Black incumbent whose family has been synonymous with his district for decades.\n\nMs. Bush now joins figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who defeated the 20-year veteran Representative Joseph Crowley in 2018, and Jamaal Bowman, who last month won a primary against Representative Eliot L. Engel, a powerful committee chairman in his 16th term representing a district straddling the Bronx and Westchester.\n\nA single mother, former nurse and pastor, Ms. Bush would be the first Black woman to represent the state of Missouri in Congress.

A congressional ethics inquiry dismissed charges that the arrangement was inappropriate.\n\nBy Luke Broadwater and Catie Edmondson\n\nReporting from the Capitol\n\nThe Justice Department is conducting an investigation into whether Representative Cori Bush mishandled campaign funds, including when she hired her romantic partner - who is now her husband - to provide her with security services.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics investigated the security arrangement by Ms. Bush, a Democrat from Missouri, last year. The office voted to recommend dismissal of the allegations after concluding that her husband, Cortney Merritts, had performed \"bona fide\" security work and did not appear to have been overpaid, and that Ms. Bush faced a level of threats that justified the work.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Bush said that she was \"fully cooperating\" with the Justice Department investigation.\n\n\"Since before I was sworn into office, I have endured relentless threats to my physical safety and life,\" Ms. Bush said. \"As a rank-and-file member of Congress, I am not entitled to personal protection by the House, and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services. I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services. Any reporting that I have used federal funds for personal security is simply false.\"\n\nThe House Ethics Committee is also investigating the matter, Ms. Bush said.\n\nMs. Bush has spoken out about the death threats she has received on Capitol Hill. She spent more on security than any other member of the House in the months after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol.\n\nPeople familiar with the investigation, who spoke about it on the condition of anonymity, said federal prosecutors were asking questions similar to those asked by the congressional investigators about Ms. Bush's security expenditures and the involvement of Mr. Merritts.

      "text": "Cori Bush, a Nurse and Activist, Becomes the First Black Woman to Represent Missouri in Congress\n\nCori Bush can lay claim to more than one professional title. She is Pastor Cori Bush, having founded a church in her native St. Louis, about a decade ago. She is also Cori Bush, registered nurse. And now she is Congresswoman-elect Cori Bush. Her victory, a romp in Missouri's First Congressional District that saw her win by sixty percentage points, was foretold by the August Democratic primary, when Bush, running as a progressive in the anti-sclerotic mode of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, defeated Lacy Clay, the incumbent. A member of a local African-American political dynasty, Clay has represented the district since 2001, having succeeded his father, Bill, who was first elected in 1968. Bush, forty-four, isn't just new blood. She will be both the first Black woman and likely the first nurse to represent Missouri in Congress. (Sending clergy to Washington, D.C., is old hat for the Show-Me State.)\n\nDespite its blue tilt, Bush's district contains multitudes. It includes the St. Louis Cardinals, Anheuser-Busch headquarters, and the city's upscale Central West End neighborhood, home to Mark and Patricia McCloskey. They are the couple who became famous this summer-and earned a speaking spot at the Republican National Convention-for waving guns at Black Lives Matter marchers while dressed like models in the most ill-conceived Talbots catalogue ever. Among the marchers that day was Bush; her district also includes Ferguson, where the B.L.M. movement was galvanized, in 2014, following the killing of eighteen-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer. Those protests are what propelled Bush into running for office-something that, as the daughter of a politician, she had sworn she would never do. Her father, Errol Bush, is an alderman and a former mayor of Northwoods, a small city in St. Louis County. \"With all the negativity and all the corruption around, with everything he had to fight, I was, like, Why would you sign up for this?\" she recalled over the phone, two days after her own election.\n\nThe gravity of what happened in Ferguson had dawned on her only gradually, as did her anger. \"That afternoon, I was scrolling on Facebook, seeing this picture of this person laying on the ground,\" she said of the August day when Brown was shot at least six times. Police then left his body in the street for four hours, on a hot afternoon. \"I kept seeing the picture and just not thinking it was real,\" she said. Finally, \"I'm, like, O.K., let me click on this and see what this is about.\" The next evening, she drove to Ferguson, where a second night of demonstrations had begun. \"I just drove around, stayed in my car, and just watched what was going on. Then, the next day, I actually got out. It was the fact that the thing didn't go away, that it was gaining steam.\" Looting had begun; a building had burned. \"There were thousands of people in the street, with a lot of violence happening. I felt like I could offer something to this situation. I was, like, You're a nurse, you can be a medic. You're clergy, you can go out and pray with people.\"\n\nThrough the mental-health clinic where she worked, she helped set up a crisis-response team. \"We pitched a tent just a few feet from where Michael Brown's body had laid on the ground, to do grief-and-trauma work.\" Her group partnered with others to provide food, diapers, and financial assistance to people whose lives had been disrupted.\n\nBy Bush's account, she grew up inured to racist treatment from cops. \"I never really questioned it,\" she said.\"I saw countless friends abused by the police, harassed by the police, profiled by the police, in different parts of town. As a child, my father was pulled over by the police so many times, I used to think that he was a horrible driver, and I would get so upset, like, 'Why won't you drive right?' \" She went on, \"I didn't think hard on the question of Is this O.K. or not? Is this right? Because you're taught in school that the police are right.\" Her impulse as a girl was to blame herself for two instances when, she said, officers sexually harassed her. \"It was, like, O.K., well, maybe I'm doing something wrong. Maybe this skirt isn't the right skirt. That was the mind-set at that time.\"\n\nWith the speech-making skills of a preacher and a nurse's backbone, Bush became a leading voice in the Black Lives Matter movement. Urged on by fellow-activists who wanted to see more Black women in the Senate, she ran in 2016, when Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent, was up for reëlection; she came in a distant second in the primary. In 2018, she set her sights on Lacy Clay, losing again. But this year, buoyed by the surge of B.L.M. activism, and despite being slowed by a nasty case of what was likely Covid -19, which sent her to the hospital twice, Bush broke through.\n\nShe said she's not concerned about the way that many Republicans have treated Congress's young progressive women of color as punching bags-Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, who campaigned for Bush during the 2018 primary. \"I have been dealing with anger from the right wing, from extremists, from white supremacists, since 2014, and I've learned the best ways for me to deal with it,\" Bush said. One of those ways is to shrug it off and laugh, as she did when Mark McCloskey called her a \"Marxist revolutionary\" at the Republican Convention. \"If they couldn't scare me in the scariest time, which was Ferguson before everybody started to get used to protests, when all of that was new, am I bothered by what they'll try to do to me now? Not at all.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "A New Group of Leftist Primary Challengers Campaign Through Protests and the Coronavirus\n\nLate on the night of June 2nd, I encountered something I hadn't seen in quite some time: good news. Scrolling through Twitter, I noticed that Nikil Saval , an old friend and collaborator (and a New Yorker contributor) looked to be the likely winner of a long-shot primary campaign against the Democratic incumbent, Larry Farnese, for a Pennsylvania State Senate seat, though absentee ballots were still being counted. Shortly after Saval declared victory, almost two weeks later, the tally was 35,709 to 27,001. Saval didn't just beat Farnese; he demolished him.\n\nBefore I came across the news about Saval, my searches for updates from Philadelphia had surfaced far more disturbing results: riot cops assaulting Black Lives Matter protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas; an angry white mob armed with baseball bats patrolling the Fishtown neighborhood. I read a distressing first-person account of how difficult it was to cast a ballot in the primary: seventy per cent of polling places were closed, and vehicle traffic was prohibited, forcing voters to travel by foot or bicycle past the National Guard. I gasped at a series of photos of a bloodied young man who ventured out despite a head injury. \"If Joe can vote after the cops beat him, you can too,\" the tweeter enjoined.\n\nSaval, who helped found Reclaim Philadelphia-a community group that has played a key role in supporting successful anti-establishment campaigns-is part of a national effort to transform the Democratic Party by pulling it to the left. Across the country, political novices, inspired by Bernie Sanders's Presidential bids and the rise of unapologetically left-wing candidates-most visibly, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-have thrown their hats into the electoral ring. These campaigns tend to coalesce around a core set of policies: Medicare for All, cancelling student debt, free public college, criminal-justice reform, and a Green New Deal. It's not enough to win more power for Democrats, Jenifer Fernandez Ancona of Way to Win, a hub for progressive donors, told me. The goal is to win power within the Democratic Party.\n\nPrimary challengers face an uphill climb under normal circumstances. In 2016, only five incumbents in Congress-two Democrats and three Republicans-lost their seats, despite the fact that more than a third of Democrats and nearly half of Republicans faced challengers. But the insurgents campaigning this spring and summer have had the terrain shift dramatically under their feet. There is no map for running a primary campaign during a global pandemic, let alone a pandemic coupled with a historic wave of civil-rights protests. Connecting face-to-face is central to insurgent campaigns, but COVID -19 made door-knocking potentially lethal. Campaigns had to shift to phone calls and digital outreach, and they've had to educate potential supporters on not just whom to vote for but how to vote, after vote-by-mail rules changed almost overnight. Delayed primaries have caused additional confusion about when, exactly, elections are taking place and have also forced candidates to keep fund-raising beyond the expected finish line.\n\nSince March, experts have speculated that the pandemic would further tip the scales toward incumbents-that anxiety about the future might push voters toward familiar figures, and that incumbents' more abundant cash reserves would allow them to reach people sheltering at home with expensive advertising blitzes. The day after he formally declared victory, Saval told me he too initially assumed the worst. \"When we couldn't knock on doors, we had to be much more active and creative,\" Saval said. Meanwhile, his opponent failed to adapt. \"They just went on TV-they used mail. They didn't make phone calls or have people at the polls like we did.\" As a result, Saval's team mobilized a comparatively young, diverse group of voters. Something similar happened across Pennsylvania, where at least nine progressive candidates defeated more moderate Democratic opponents; Rick Krajewski, another Reclaim organizer, is likely heading to the state house with Saval after the general election in the fall. The same day, in New Mexico, five incumbent state senators were ousted by progressives in the Democratic primaries. Teresa Leger Fernandez, a local attorney and activist, won an outright victory in a seven-way primary for New Mexico's Third Congressional District, beating the former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame and others.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Janeese Lewis George, a thirty-two-year-old attorney and a democratic socialist, won a decisive upset against the incumbent D.C.-council member Brandon Todd, a former Republican. She secured critical union endorsements by talking directly to the rank and file, and strategically mobilized voters by having volunteers reach out to fellow Spanish speakers or neighbors contact people living nearby. As the weeks wore on and the coronavirus crisis deepened, her opponent's opposition to paid family leave, increasing wages for tipped workers, and demilitarizing the police seemed increasingly out of touch. In May, Democrats for Education Reform DC, which endorsed Todd, sent out a mailer attacking George's commitment to reallocating part of the police budget; little did it know that defunding the police would soon be a national rallying cry. \"Reality endorsed me at the right time,\" George reflected, clearly pleased.\n\nBy campaigning as Democrats, instead of running on a third-party ticket, candidates like George and Saval are reviving an old and largely forgotten tradition. A century ago, when primaries were introduced as a progressive reform to take power away from corrupt party bosses, insiders worried that radicals would use them to hijack the two main parties-and their fears were soon realized. In 1915, a former Socialist Party organizer named Arthur C. Townley founded the Nonpartisan League, in North Dakota, which connected poor rural farmers around economic grievances, overcoming differences in members' ethnicity and religion to build a powerful organization. Applying the group's experience with coöperative economics to the political realm, it demanded a state-owned bank and state-owned mill and elevator to stop exploitation by large agriculture firms. Using the primary system, the Nonpartisan League was able to capture the North Dakota Republican Party, and it briefly controlled the state government. The bank and mill it built are still in operation.\n\nA similar strategy is taking hold among some leftists today. Last year, the Chicago branch of the Democratic Socialists of America formally endorsed a group of five candidates for local government; they now control six of the city's fifty council seats. Inspired by that example, six primary candidates are now running as a D.S.A.-backed slate for a variety of state offices in New York. Their common platform includes support for single-payer health care, public housing and tenant protections, immigrant and worker rights, defunding the police, and a Green New Deal. They do joint fund-raisers and outreach to expand their collective influence. Jabari Brisport, a math teacher from Brooklyn who is running for an open State Senate seat as part of the slate, told me that the collaborative campaigning reflects socialist principles. \"It's about sharing resources,\" he said.\n\nBrisport told me that he knocked on seven hundred doors as part of Julia Salazar's successful campaign for the State Senate, in 2018, a tactic that is off the table during the pandemic. (In one of history's many strange echoes, the Nonpartisan League's success beyond North Dakota was hampered by the arrival of the 1918 Spanish flu, which led to a prohibition on public gatherings and made people reluctant to open their doors for campaigners.) In response, the D.S.A.-backed slate has shifted to a digital strategy, making calls and sending texts by the thousands and hosting events and fund-raisers. More significantly, all the candidates I spoke to have remade their campaigns to prioritize direct service and mutual aid. Samelys López, a longtime community activist whose organizing chops helped propel Ocasio-Cortez to Congress, is a slate candidate running for an open seat in New York's Fifteenth District, which is the poorest and most Democratic district in the country. \"In our wellness checks\"-calls that begin with asking how people are -\"what we are seeing is hunger,\" López told me. Sometimes López delivers food in the district, using meal delivery to connect neighbors so they can begin advocating for their rights. \"I feel like the people that live here in this community subsidize everyone's way of life in the city and outside of the city,\" López observed. They are the front-line workers keeping everyone else afloat and risking their lives just by doing their jobs. \"It seems to me that, especially during this time, we should compensate people for putting their lives on the line.\"\n\nLópez was homeless as a young person; she's lived in shelters and has had to depend on food banks. Her experiences, she believes, are part of what qualify her to hold office. Something similar could be said of Phara Souffrant Forrest, a thirty-one-year-old Haitian-American maternal-health field nurse, who is also running as part of D.S.A.'s slate. A lifelong resident of Crown Heights, in Brooklyn, and a longtime housing-justice activist, she is challenging the incumbent Walter Mosley for his seat in the State Assembly, running on a platform of tenants' rights, free universal health care, and police reform. Forrest's profession gives her an edge when it comes to making cold calls: these days, people are thrilled to learn that they have a nurse on the line. She's had people ask her about medications and what to expect when giving birth at the hospital during the pandemic. (Cori Bush, a nurse who is running a primary campaign for Congress in Missouri, also commented on the public's newfound respect for health-care workers: \"When I say I'm a nurse, it's like I said I was the Vice-President.\")\n\nNew York, which will hold its primary election on June 23rd, may well be the next state to see a wave of insurgents defeat Democratic incumbents. On Tuesday, June 2nd, at a community event focussed on police violence, the sixteen-term New York congressman Eliot Engel, of the Sixteenth District, was caught on a hot mike asking Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz, Jr., for the chance to speak. \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care,\" Engel said, repeating himself to drive the point home.\n\nJamaal Bowman, a former middle-school principal, is Engel's most formidable opponent. Backed by Justice Democrats, the political action committee that helped elect Ocasio-Cortez, Bowman has collected endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and New York City's public advocate, Jumaane Williams. In a recent televised debate, Bowman, who grew up in New York City's Upper East Side, recounted first being racially profiled, when he was eleven. He was playing outside with friends and someone called the police, complaining of noise. \"The police didn't just approach us and ask us to be quiet-they handcuffed me, they threw me against the wall, they dragged my face on the ground,\" he said. \"I had to go upstairs and show my mother my face, which was all bruised up.\" Bowman went on to talk about bipartisan crime bills and restorative justice. Engel, by contrast, began his remarks by blaming Donald Trump for the unrest and boasting about being part of the impeachment hearings.\n\nThe protesters filling the nation's streets, many of whom may soon be heading to the polls, no doubt despise President Trump, but they also seem to understand that racism didn't begin with his election. As Bowman sees it, the problem lies with institutions, not individuals, whether they are bad Presidents or bad cops. \"Police brutality is a major component of institutional racism,\" he told me. \"But so are disparities in health care, housing, environmental justice, jobs, underfunded schools.\" These disparities are apparent in the Sixteenth District, which encompasses southern Westchester County and parts of the Bronx, and is one of the most unequal districts in the country.\n\nActivists have long been sounding the alarm about social inequities that go back decades and require deep structural changes, not superficial reforms. \"What the pandemic has done is put all of those on the accelerator,\" Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, said. \"There's only so much that the status quo can really say when it comes to fixing the fundamental problems that are so blatant and that everybody can see right now\"-from a mishandled public-health crisis to the shocking persistence of police misconduct. During the pandemic, tens of millions of people, who are disproportionately black and poor, have lost their jobs and their medical coverage and may soon face eviction. While elected officials of both parties granted corporations a multi-trillion-dollar bailout, George Floyd was killed for allegedly passing a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The fact that this month's protests kicked off in Democratic strongholds-including Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta-only underscores discontent with the Party's current leadership. Janeese George made this much plain, saying, \"Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner. Let's go all the way back. How many names can we name up until George Floyd where Democrats were in power?\"\n\nIt's incredibly hard to win a primary, and it's equally difficult for a challenger wave to maintain its momentum. Robert Boatright, a professor of political science at Clark University who studies primary elections, doesn't believe the contest for power within the Democratic Party is particularly remarkable. \"You always see a rise in challenges to incumbents when there is a surge toward one party or the other,\" he said. Most surges last a couple of election cycles, \"and then they go away.\" When Barack Obama was in the White House, the Tea Party targeted the Republicans, toppling incumbents or at least forcing them to watch their right flank. What we're seeing today is the left-wing counterpart of the same short-lived phenomena.\n\nThe candidates and activists I spoke to want to break that cycle; their goal is to build lasting infrastructure that can shift the balance of power in the Democratic Party toward a multiracial working class. To accomplish this, they'll need to invest in ways to identify, vet, and support potential candidates, training them in how to run for office and get out the vote. (Organized labor used to do this on a grander scale than it does now; first, you served as shop steward, then you aimed for City Hall.) The right has the Club for Growth and evangelical churches; the left has groups like Justice Democrats, Way to Win, and Brand New Congress, as well as nurses and teachers unions. George attended the Black Campaign School, an electoral boot camp, and was backed by the Working Families Party, the D.S.A., the local Black Lives Matter chapter, and multiple unions.\n\nAll the candidates I spoke to said that they are playing to win. But, for primary challengers, there can be victory in defeat. \"You can draw attention to your cause by running a primary campaign even if you're unsuccessful,\" Boatright said. It can also pay off to be dogged. That's why three of Justice Democrats' nine challenger candidates are running for a second time, including Marie Newman, in Illinois (the only victorious Democratic congressional primary challenger so far this cycle); Kara Eastman, in Nebraska; and Cori Bush, the nurse from St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nBush is attempting, once again, to unseat the ten-term incumbent Lacy Clay, whose father held the seat before him. A former teacher and pastor, and a single mother, Bush gained a national profile after being featured in the popular documentary \"Knock Down the House,\" which tracked her 2018 primary campaign along with those of three others, including Ocasio-Cortez. Bush helped organize the protests in Ferguson, in 2014, after Michael Brown was killed by police. When I spoke to her in early June, she had recovered from a two-month bout of what appeared to be COVID -19-related pneumonia, and had been out protesting once again, shouting the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, and cheering on a new generation of demonstrators.\n\n\"I'm seeing some people have been traumatized, who are being retraumatized, but they decided to go back out there on that ground to fight in the face of death,\" Bush said. \"Because, you know, you can die on these streets. And they're standing out there making their voices heard.\" Change, Bush believes, is long overdue. \"People want to focus on all the property damage, and people want to call that violence,\" Bush said. \"But we wouldn't be here right now if the actual violence in our communities had been taken care of\"-that of poverty, hunger, lack of health care, and an absence of well-paid work, as well as police brutality. \"The people that are paid to take care of that, they haven't done it,\" she said.\n\nPointing to the uprising, Bush asked, \"What if that same tenacity, what if that same power and drive, was seated in Congress?\" If she wins the primary election, on August 4th, we may soon find out.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Cori Bush, a Nurse and Activist, Becomes the First Black Woman to Represent Missouri in Congress\n\nCori Bush can lay claim to more than one professional title. She is Pastor Cori Bush, having founded a church in her native St. Louis, about a decade ago. She is also Cori Bush, registered nurse. And now she is Congresswoman-elect Cori Bush. Her victory, a romp in Missouri's First Congressional District that saw her win by sixty percentage points, was foretold by the August Democratic primary, when Bush, running as a progressive in the anti-sclerotic mode of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, defeated Lacy Clay, the incumbent. A member of a local African-American political dynasty, Clay has represented the district since 2001, having succeeded his father, Bill, who was first elected in 1968. Bush, forty-four, isn't just new blood. She will be both the first Black woman and likely the first nurse to represent Missouri in Congress. (Sending clergy to Washington, D.C., is old hat for the Show-Me State.)\n\nDespite its blue tilt, Bush's district contains multitudes. It includes the St. Louis Cardinals, Anheuser-Busch headquarters, and the city's upscale Central West End neighborhood, home to Mark and Patricia McCloskey. They are the couple who became famous this summer-and earned a speaking spot at the Republican National Convention-for waving guns at Black Lives Matter marchers while dressed like models in the most ill-conceived Talbots catalogue ever. Among the marchers that day was Bush; her district also includes Ferguson, where the B.L.M. movement was galvanized, in 2014, following the killing of eighteen-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer. Those protests are what propelled Bush into running for office-something that, as the daughter of a politician, she had sworn she would never do. Her father, Errol Bush, is an alderman and a former mayor of Northwoods, a small city in St. Louis County. \"With all the negativity and all the corruption around, with everything he had to fight, I was, like, Why would you sign up for this?\" she recalled over the phone, two days after her own election.\n\nThe gravity of what happened in Ferguson had dawned on her only gradually, as did her anger. \"That afternoon, I was scrolling on Facebook, seeing this picture of this person laying on the ground,\" she said of the August day when Brown was shot at least six times. Police then left his body in the street for four hours, on a hot afternoon. \"I kept seeing the picture and just not thinking it was real,\" she said. Finally, \"I'm, like, O.K., let me click on this and see what this is about.\" The next evening, she drove to Ferguson, where a second night of demonstrations had begun. \"I just drove around, stayed in my car, and just watched what was going on. Then, the next day, I actually got out. It was the fact that the thing didn't go away, that it was gaining steam.\" Looting had begun; a building had burned. \"There were thousands of people in the street, with a lot of violence happening. I felt like I could offer something to this situation. I was, like, You're a nurse, you can be a medic. You're clergy, you can go out and pray with people.\"\n\nThrough the mental-health clinic where she worked, she helped set up a crisis-response team. \"We pitched a tent just a few feet from where Michael Brown's body had laid on the ground, to do grief-and-trauma work.\" Her group partnered with others to provide food, diapers, and financial assistance to people whose lives had been disrupted.\n\nBy Bush's account, she grew up inured to racist treatment from cops. \"I never really questioned it,\" she said.\"I saw countless friends abused by the police, harassed by the police, profiled by the police, in different parts of town. As a child, my father was pulled over by the police so many times, I used to think that he was a horrible driver, and I would get so upset, like, 'Why won't you drive right?' \" She went on, \"I didn't think hard on the question of Is this O.K. or not? Is this right? Because you're taught in school that the police are right.\" Her impulse as a girl was to blame herself for two instances when, she said, officers sexually harassed her. \"It was, like, O.K., well, maybe I'm doing something wrong. Maybe this skirt isn't the right skirt. That was the mind-set at that time.\"\n\nWith the speech-making skills of a preacher and a nurse's backbone, Bush became a leading voice in the Black Lives Matter movement. Urged on by fellow-activists who wanted to see more Black women in the Senate, she ran in 2016, when Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent, was up for reëlection; she came in a distant second in the primary. In 2018, she set her sights on Lacy Clay, losing again. But this year, buoyed by the surge of B.L.M. activism, and despite being slowed by a nasty case of what was likely Covid -19, which sent her to the hospital twice, Bush broke through.\n\nShe said she's not concerned about the way that many Republicans have treated Congress's young progressive women of color as punching bags-Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, who campaigned for Bush during the 2018 primary. \"I have been dealing with anger from the right wing, from extremists, from white supremacists, since 2014, and I've learned the best ways for me to deal with it,\" Bush said. One of those ways is to shrug it off and laugh, as she did when Mark McCloskey called her a \"Marxist revolutionary\" at the Republican Convention. \"If they couldn't scare me in the scariest time, which was Ferguson before everybody started to get used to protests, when all of that was new, am I bothered by what they'll try to do to me now?

      "text": "A New Group of Leftist Primary Challengers Campaign Through Protests and the Coronavirus\n\nLate on the night of June 2nd, I encountered something I hadn't seen in quite some time: good news. Scrolling through Twitter, I noticed that Nikil Saval , an old friend and collaborator (and a New Yorker contributor) looked to be the likely winner of a long-shot primary campaign against the Democratic incumbent, Larry Farnese, for a Pennsylvania State Senate seat, though absentee ballots were still being counted. Shortly after Saval declared victory, almost two weeks later, the tally was 35,709 to 27,001. Saval didn't just beat Farnese; he demolished him.\n\nBefore I came across the news about Saval, my searches for updates from Philadelphia had surfaced far more disturbing results: riot cops assaulting Black Lives Matter protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas; an angry white mob armed with baseball bats patrolling the Fishtown neighborhood. I read a distressing first-person account of how difficult it was to cast a ballot in the primary: seventy per cent of polling places were closed, and vehicle traffic was prohibited, forcing voters to travel by foot or bicycle past the National Guard. I gasped at a series of photos of a bloodied young man who ventured out despite a head injury. \"If Joe can vote after the cops beat him, you can too,\" the tweeter enjoined.\n\nSaval, who helped found Reclaim Philadelphia-a community group that has played a key role in supporting successful anti-establishment campaigns-is part of a national effort to transform the Democratic Party by pulling it to the left. Across the country, political novices, inspired by Bernie Sanders's Presidential bids and the rise of unapologetically left-wing candidates-most visibly, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-have thrown their hats into the electoral ring. These campaigns tend to coalesce around a core set of policies: Medicare for All, cancelling student debt, free public college, criminal-justice reform, and a Green New Deal. It's not enough to win more power for Democrats, Jenifer Fernandez Ancona of Way to Win, a hub for progressive donors, told me. The goal is to win power within the Democratic Party.\n\nPrimary challengers face an uphill climb under normal circumstances. In 2016, only five incumbents in Congress-two Democrats and three Republicans-lost their seats, despite the fact that more than a third of Democrats and nearly half of Republicans faced challengers. But the insurgents campaigning this spring and summer have had the terrain shift dramatically under their feet. There is no map for running a primary campaign during a global pandemic, let alone a pandemic coupled with a historic wave of civil-rights protests. Connecting face-to-face is central to insurgent campaigns, but COVID -19 made door-knocking potentially lethal. Campaigns had to shift to phone calls and digital outreach, and they've had to educate potential supporters on not just whom to vote for but how to vote, after vote-by-mail rules changed almost overnight. Delayed primaries have caused additional confusion about when, exactly, elections are taking place and have also forced candidates to keep fund-raising beyond the expected finish line.\n\nSince March, experts have speculated that the pandemic would further tip the scales toward incumbents-that anxiety about the future might push voters toward familiar figures, and that incumbents' more abundant cash reserves would allow them to reach people sheltering at home with expensive advertising blitzes. The day after he formally declared victory, Saval told me he too initially assumed the worst. \"When we couldn't knock on doors, we had to be much more active and creative,\" Saval said. Meanwhile, his opponent failed to adapt. \"They just went on TV-they used mail. They didn't make phone calls or have people at the polls like we did.\" As a result, Saval's team mobilized a comparatively young, diverse group of voters. Something similar happened across Pennsylvania, where at least nine progressive candidates defeated more moderate Democratic opponents; Rick Krajewski, another Reclaim organizer, is likely heading to the state house with Saval after the general election in the fall. The same day, in New Mexico, five incumbent state senators were ousted by progressives in the Democratic primaries. Teresa Leger Fernandez, a local attorney and activist, won an outright victory in a seven-way primary for New Mexico's Third Congressional District, beating the former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame and others.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Janeese Lewis George, a thirty-two-year-old attorney and a democratic socialist, won a decisive upset against the incumbent D.C.-council member Brandon Todd, a former Republican. She secured critical union endorsements by talking directly to the rank and file, and strategically mobilized voters by having volunteers reach out to fellow Spanish speakers or neighbors contact people living nearby. As the weeks wore on and the coronavirus crisis deepened, her opponent's opposition to paid family leave, increasing wages for tipped workers, and demilitarizing the police seemed increasingly out of touch. In May, Democrats for Education Reform DC, which endorsed Todd, sent out a mailer attacking George's commitment to reallocating part of the police budget; little did it know that defunding the police would soon be a national rallying cry. \"Reality endorsed me at the right time,\" George reflected, clearly pleased.\n\nBy campaigning as Democrats, instead of running on a third-party ticket, candidates like George and Saval are reviving an old and largely forgotten tradition. A century ago, when primaries were introduced as a progressive reform to take power away from corrupt party bosses, insiders worried that radicals would use them to hijack the two main parties-and their fears were soon realized. In 1915, a former Socialist Party organizer named Arthur C. Townley founded the Nonpartisan League, in North Dakota, which connected poor rural farmers around economic grievances, overcoming differences in members' ethnicity and religion to build a powerful organization. Applying the group's experience with coöperative economics to the political realm, it demanded a state-owned bank and state-owned mill and elevator to stop exploitation by large agriculture firms. Using the primary system, the Nonpartisan League was able to capture the North Dakota Republican Party, and it briefly controlled the state government. The bank and mill it built are still in operation.\n\nA similar strategy is taking hold among some leftists today. Last year, the Chicago branch of the Democratic Socialists of America formally endorsed a group of five candidates for local government; they now control six of the city's fifty council seats. Inspired by that example, six primary candidates are now running as a D.S.A.-backed slate for a variety of state offices in New York. Their common platform includes support for single-payer health care, public housing and tenant protections, immigrant and worker rights, defunding the police, and a Green New Deal. They do joint fund-raisers and outreach to expand their collective influence. Jabari Brisport, a math teacher from Brooklyn who is running for an open State Senate seat as part of the slate, told me that the collaborative campaigning reflects socialist principles. \"It's about sharing resources,\" he said.\n\nBrisport told me that he knocked on seven hundred doors as part of Julia Salazar's successful campaign for the State Senate, in 2018, a tactic that is off the table during the pandemic. (In one of history's many strange echoes, the Nonpartisan League's success beyond North Dakota was hampered by the arrival of the 1918 Spanish flu, which led to a prohibition on public gatherings and made people reluctant to open their doors for campaigners.) In response, the D.S.A.-backed slate has shifted to a digital strategy, making calls and sending texts by the thousands and hosting events and fund-raisers. More significantly, all the candidates I spoke to have remade their campaigns to prioritize direct service and mutual aid. Samelys López, a longtime community activist whose organizing chops helped propel Ocasio-Cortez to Congress, is a slate candidate running for an open seat in New York's Fifteenth District, which is the poorest and most Democratic district in the country. \"In our wellness checks\"-calls that begin with asking how people are -\"what we are seeing is hunger,\" López told me. Sometimes López delivers food in the district, using meal delivery to connect neighbors so they can begin advocating for their rights. \"I feel like the people that live here in this community subsidize everyone's way of life in the city and outside of the city,\" López observed. They are the front-line workers keeping everyone else afloat and risking their lives just by doing their jobs. \"It seems to me that, especially during this time, we should compensate people for putting their lives on the line.\"\n\nLópez was homeless as a young person; she's lived in shelters and has had to depend on food banks. Her experiences, she believes, are part of what qualify her to hold office. Something similar could be said of Phara Souffrant Forrest, a thirty-one-year-old Haitian-American maternal-health field nurse, who is also running as part of D.S.A.'s slate. A lifelong resident of Crown Heights, in Brooklyn, and a longtime housing-justice activist, she is challenging the incumbent Walter Mosley for his seat in the State Assembly, running on a platform of tenants' rights, free universal health care, and police reform. Forrest's profession gives her an edge when it comes to making cold calls: these days, people are thrilled to learn that they have a nurse on the line. She's had people ask her about medications and what to expect when giving birth at the hospital during the pandemic. (Cori Bush, a nurse who is running a primary campaign for Congress in Missouri, also commented on the public's newfound respect for health-care workers: \"When I say I'm a nurse, it's like I said I was the Vice-President.\")\n\nNew York, which will hold its primary election on June 23rd, may well be the next state to see a wave of insurgents defeat Democratic incumbents. On Tuesday, June 2nd, at a community event focussed on police violence, the sixteen-term New York congressman Eliot Engel, of the Sixteenth District, was caught on a hot mike asking Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz, Jr., for the chance to speak. \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care,\" Engel said, repeating himself to drive the point home.\n\nJamaal Bowman, a former middle-school principal, is Engel's most formidable opponent. Backed by Justice Democrats, the political action committee that helped elect Ocasio-Cortez, Bowman has collected endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and New York City's public advocate, Jumaane Williams. In a recent televised debate, Bowman, who grew up in New York City's Upper East Side, recounted first being racially profiled, when he was eleven. He was playing outside with friends and someone called the police, complaining of noise. \"The police didn't just approach us and ask us to be quiet-they handcuffed me, they threw me against the wall, they dragged my face on the ground,\" he said. \"I had to go upstairs and show my mother my face, which was all bruised up.\" Bowman went on to talk about bipartisan crime bills and restorative justice. Engel, by contrast, began his remarks by blaming Donald Trump for the unrest and boasting about being part of the impeachment hearings.\n\nThe protesters filling the nation's streets, many of whom may soon be heading to the polls, no doubt despise President Trump, but they also seem to understand that racism didn't begin with his election. As Bowman sees it, the problem lies with institutions, not individuals, whether they are bad Presidents or bad cops. \"Police brutality is a major component of institutional racism,\" he told me. \"But so are disparities in health care, housing, environmental justice, jobs, underfunded schools.\" These disparities are apparent in the Sixteenth District, which encompasses southern Westchester County and parts of the Bronx, and is one of the most unequal districts in the country.\n\nActivists have long been sounding the alarm about social inequities that go back decades and require deep structural changes, not superficial reforms. \"What the pandemic has done is put all of those on the accelerator,\" Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, said. \"There's only so much that the status quo can really say when it comes to fixing the fundamental problems that are so blatant and that everybody can see right now\"-from a mishandled public-health crisis to the shocking persistence of police misconduct. During the pandemic, tens of millions of people, who are disproportionately black and poor, have lost their jobs and their medical coverage and may soon face eviction. While elected officials of both parties granted corporations a multi-trillion-dollar bailout, George Floyd was killed for allegedly passing a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The fact that this month's protests kicked off in Democratic strongholds-including Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta-only underscores discontent with the Party's current leadership. Janeese George made this much plain, saying, \"Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner. Let's go all the way back. How many names can we name up until George Floyd where Democrats were in power?\"\n\nIt's incredibly hard to win a primary, and it's equally difficult for a challenger wave to maintain its momentum. Robert Boatright, a professor of political science at Clark University who studies primary elections, doesn't believe the contest for power within the Democratic Party is particularly remarkable. \"You always see a rise in challenges to incumbents when there is a surge toward one party or the other,\" he said. Most surges last a couple of election cycles, \"and then they go away.\" When Barack Obama was in the White House, the Tea Party targeted the Republicans, toppling incumbents or at least forcing them to watch their right flank. What we're seeing today is the left-wing counterpart of the same short-lived phenomena.\n\nThe candidates and activists I spoke to want to break that cycle; their goal is to build lasting infrastructure that can shift the balance of power in the Democratic Party toward a multiracial working class. To accomplish this, they'll need to invest in ways to identify, vet, and support potential candidates, training them in how to run for office and get out the vote. (Organized labor used to do this on a grander scale than it does now; first, you served as shop steward, then you aimed for City Hall.) The right has the Club for Growth and evangelical churches; the left has groups like Justice Democrats, Way to Win, and Brand New Congress, as well as nurses and teachers unions. George attended the Black Campaign School, an electoral boot camp, and was backed by the Working Families Party, the D.S.A., the local Black Lives Matter chapter, and multiple unions.\n\nAll the candidates I spoke to said that they are playing to win. But, for primary challengers, there can be victory in defeat. \"You can draw attention to your cause by running a primary campaign even if you're unsuccessful,\" Boatright said. It can also pay off to be dogged. That's why three of Justice Democrats' nine challenger candidates are running for a second time, including Marie Newman, in Illinois (the only victorious Democratic congressional primary challenger so far this cycle); Kara Eastman, in Nebraska; and Cori Bush, the nurse from St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nBush is attempting, once again, to unseat the ten-term incumbent Lacy Clay, whose father held the seat before him. A former teacher and pastor, and a single mother, Bush gained a national profile after being featured in the popular documentary \"Knock Down the House,\" which tracked her 2018 primary campaign along with those of three others, including Ocasio-Cortez. Bush helped organize the protests in Ferguson, in 2014, after Michael Brown was killed by police. When I spoke to her in early June, she had recovered from a two-month bout of what appeared to be COVID -19-related pneumonia, and had been out protesting once again, shouting the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, and cheering on a new generation of demonstrators.\n\n\"I'm seeing some people have been traumatized, who are being retraumatized, but they decided to go back out there on that ground to fight in the face of death,\" Bush said. \"Because, you know, you can die on these streets. And they're standing out there making their voices heard.\" Change, Bush believes, is long overdue. \"People want to focus on all the property damage, and people want to call that violence,\" Bush said. \"But we wouldn't be here right now if the actual violence in our communities had been taken care of\"-that of poverty, hunger, lack of health care, and an absence of well-paid work, as well as police brutality. \"The people that are paid to take care of that, they haven't done it,\" she said.\n\nPointing to the uprising, Bush asked, \"What if that same tenacity, what if that same power and drive, was seated in Congress?\" If she wins the primary election, on August 4th, we may soon find out.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "A Powerful Lobbying Group Is Coming for Another Member of the Squad\n\nProgressive congresswoman and \"Squad\" member Cori Bush is in the fight for her political life in Missouri, hoping a grassroots campaign can fend off a well-funded primary challenge from local prosecutor and Democrat Wesley Bell. A key difference between these two Democrats is the backing of the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee: Bell has it, and Bush does not. The primary, which will be decided by voters on Tuesday, is another test of political might for the outside group determined to oust as many critics of Israel's war in Gaza from Congress as possible this election cycle.\n\nBush is the incumbent, holding Missouri's 1st Congressional District's seat since 2021, after wresting it from 10-term incumbent Democrat William Lacy Clay in a 2020 primary. In the process, she became the first Black congresswoman to represent Missouri and the first activist from the Black Lives Matter movement to earn a seat in Congress. She has been an unstinting voice on progressive issues from housing to policing to the Green New Deal. But since the beginning of Israel's war in Gaza, a response to the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas last year, Bush has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his tactics. She has consistently raised awareness of the more than 39,000 Palestinians killed and Israel's alleged violations of domestic and international laws. And most recently, Bush boycotted Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, along with nearly half of House and Senate Democrats, calling him a war criminal and calling his government's actions in Gaza a genocide.\n\nBush was among a bevy of lawmakers AIPAC planned to target in 2024 as part of a plan to spend $100 million to boost pro-Israel candidates in open seats and push out sitting representatives who are insufficiently deferential to Netanyahu. Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib-the only Palestinian American in Congress-were also on AIPAC's wish list, but all three women were quick to close ranks with impressive fundraising hauls and endorsements. Unable to recruit strong challengers in those races, AIPAC quietly backed off, choosing not to take any action (though they could still put money behind Omar's challenger, Don Samuels). Bush was not as fortunate.\n\nAIPAC entered Bush's primary by supporting Bell, who pledged to Bush in a leaked 2023 phone call that he would not run against her-and the group has collectively sunk nearly $12 million into the race, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. That spending has included a blitz of negative advertising across TV, radio, print, and phone-banking efforts-but the ads avoid all mention of Bush's criticisms of Israel. Last week, the Intercept reported that one of the mailers paid for by AIPAC visibly distorted Bush's facial features. (AIPAC rejects the claim.) \"The people of St. Louis deserve better than to see their first Black Congresswoman racistly distorted into a caricature,\" Bush said in a statement.\n\nBush has been unable to catch up with AIPAC's spending and fundraising; her campaign raised $2.9 million and had $354,000 in cash on hand as of July 17, while Bell raised $4.8 million and maintained $1.8 million in cash. Making matters worse for Bush is the fact that she's under three federal investigations for campaign finance violations, related to her campaign hiring her now-husband to work as her security guard. It's forced Bush to divert sorely needed campaign funds to foot her legal bills .\n\nBell, a prosecuting attorney for Missouri's St. Louis County, was initially running for the state's Senate seat against Republican Josh Hawley, but after five months in that race, he decided to drop out and run against Bush instead. That decision has pitted two Black, self-described progressives against each other in a blue pocket of a bright-red state. However, Bell's campaign doesn't see it that way. In an interview with Slate, Anjan Mukherjee, Bell's campaign adviser, said the prosecutor primaried Bush because he had been \"approached by people in the district and by folks in Washington who are fed up with Bush not representing this district.\"\n\nWhen it came to AIPAC's outsized involvement in Bell's race, Mukherjee tried to minimize its influence as it being simply one of multiple interest groups donating and spending on this race-to date, almost two-thirds of Bell's campaign donations have come from AIPAC bundling, according to Sludge. And, as Slate's Alex Sammon noted , AIPAC has strong links to Republican megadonors and billionaires, including donors to Donald Trump, who have contributed millions to the group's super PAC. That super PAC, United Democracy Project, is the top outside spender in the primary as well, in what has become the third most expensive House primary ever.\n\nMukherjee went on to criticize Bush for voting against President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill and for being one of the most absent lawmakers during vote days in the House. (From Jan. 2021 to July 2024, Bush missed 241 of 2,122 roll-call votes -about 11 percent. The median missed-vote rate is about 2 percent.)\n\nBush has defended her record by pointing to her vote for Biden's American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, which brought over $1.5 billion to St. Louis . That money was used to fund violence prevention programs, the state's first guaranteed income program, schools across the district, and more. Bush has also talked about getting signage installed at Coldwater Creek, a body of water in her district that's been contaminated with radioactive waste for decades. She's earned endorsements from top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the rest of House Democratic leadership. (Though they have not visited St. Louis to stump for Bush.) She has racked up local endorsements and support from labor unions, too.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Bell's and Bush's paths crossed as activists. The congresswoman participated in the Ferguson protests that came after a policeman shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014. Bell was a municipal court judge at the time and didn't participate in the protests, but he hosted discussions in the community to talk about the state of policing. Bush went on to run for Congress, while Bell ran for City Council and then became the first Black prosecuting attorney of St. Louis County. He ran with a campaign promise to prosecute the policeman charged with murdering Brown. But once in office, Bell declined to charge him. It's something Bush is using against Bell, with ads featuring the Brown family . \"I feel like he lied to us,\" Michael Brown Sr., Brown's father, says of Bell. \"He used my family for power and now he's trying to sell out St. Louis.\"\n\nBell has also been staunchly supportive of Netanyahu's war effort and has said he supports the U.S. continuing to send unconditional military aid to Israel. Of course, that issue has little salience in a district like Missouri's 1 st , which is majority Black, with few Republicans. And while AIPAC is clearly hoping to replicate the result from six weeks ago in New York's 16 th District, where Democrat and Squad member Jamaal Bowman lost his primary to moderate George Latimer after AIPAC spent $14 million in advertising attacking Bowman, those districts are very different.\n\nSo far, polling of the race has been all over the place, with results varying from Bush and Bell bieng in a dead heat to Bell holding a 20-plus-point lead. Bush has put up a serious fight, but if AIPAC has its way, and Bell triumphs, Tuesday's primary results will further empower the lobbying group to aggressively pursue lawmakers who do not fall in line with unconditional support for Israel.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The George Floyd Era Is Over in Congress\n\nOn June 6, 2020, some 500,000 Americans turned out across over 500 cities and towns for the single largest day of protest over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Over the course of that month, somewhere between 15 million and 26 million people participated in public demonstrations, making Black Lives Matter possibly the largest protest movement in U.S. history .\n\nLater that month, Bronx middle school principal Jamaal Bowman won a Democratic congressional primary election against incumbent Eliot Engel in New York's 16 th District, becoming the first BLM-affiliated member of Congress. (Bowman had become a fixture at protests, sharing his story of having been beaten with a nightstick as a preteen and, later, of having been detained for failing to use a turn signal while driving.) Six weeks after Bowman's primary win, a second activist, St. Louis' Cori Bush, won a Democratic primary in Missouri's 1 st District. (She had become an organizer and protest leader after the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.) Bush became the BLM movement's second congressional rep.\n\nNow, just over four years later, both Bowman and Bush have been routed out of Congress, thanks to a historic deluge of big-money spending against them. They battled challengers in the most and third-most-expensive congressional primaries in American history, respectively, and each was outspent roughly 4-1 . In both races, the overwhelming majority of that money came from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the conservative, pro-Netanyahu lobbying group that has fast become one of the biggest outside spenders in elections, funded in large part by Republican megadonors . The cryptocurrency industry, also increasingly Republican-aligned , chipped in at least $1.5 million to knock out Bush and over $2 million to knock out Bowman too.\n\nThe result is an exclamation point on what has become a sad legacy of the largest popular uprising in American history, of which there is now zero evidence in Congress. It took not even two cycles of spending and pushback to bring the George Floyd era to a close.\n\nDespite broad popular support for legislation to curtail police violence, Congress got nothing done. Democrats, despite controlling both the House and Senate in 2021 and 2022, slow-walked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, insisting on bipartisan support that never materialized. Ending qualified immunity, the legal standard that prevents police officers from being sued for wrongdoing even when they knowingly break the law, was deemed not urgent by Jim Clyburn, then the highest-ranking Black member of the Democratic House majority, despite that being a core demand of the protest movement. Once that slipped away, it opened the door to even smaller reforms floating out of reach.\n\nIn the end, despite the embarrassing photo op in which Democratic leaders donned matching kente-cloth stoles and knelt on the floor of the Capitol building, no reforms were passed into law. After much hand-wringing over activists' use of the slogan \"Defund the Police,\" no major efforts to defund large police departments were ever implemented . Police killings continued to increase: Officers killed at least 1,232 people in 2023, the deadliest year in a decade.\n\nNow not even a single representative who swept into Congress on the heels of the popular mandate of police reform remains.\n\nIt's a stark outcome. Consider, for example, Georgia Rep. John Lewis, an activist during the Civil Rights Movement and the leader of the 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma, Alabama. Lewis continued his activist work for years afterward, arriving in Congress only in the 1980s, but he served 17 terms as a celebrated member of the Democratic House caucus until his death in 2020.\n\nThis week, it's possible another member of a popular protest movement will be knocked from her seat in Congress: Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. Omar won her race in 2018, swept into Congress as part of a broader, women-led protest movement during that period, which included the Women's March, demonstrations against the Muslim ban, and the #MeToo movement. She and fellow 2018 winner Rashida Tlaib of Michigan became the first Muslim women to win seats in Congress.\n\nOmar is up against former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, who also challenged her in 2022. In that 2022 race, Samuels was the beneficiary of AIPAC spending on his behalf to the tune of $350,000. The group has so far spent only $20,000 for him this time around, but Samuels raised a substantial $100,000 in the 24 hours after Bush's defeat last week, a sign that there is belief within the donor network that Omar could be ousted as well.\n\nPolling has shown Omar leading comfortably , but money is a difference maker-and major last-minute cash infusions could change things.\n\nThe ambition among big-money organizations to drive activism-aligned members of Congress from their seats has never been clearer; there's now a winning playbook to do so as well. The Black Lives Matter movement, which was a decentralized and largely organic outpouring of popular rage, failed to convert into a more durable political organization, which meant that it couldn't mount any campaign (or raise the vast amounts of money needed) to protect its congressional allies.\n\nThe result, simply, is that the Squad-the young, nonwhite, progressive members of Congress elected between 2018 and 2022-has seen its ranks thinned out dramatically. Now its entire 2020 class is gone.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Activist Upsets 10-Term Democratic Congressman in Primary\n\nThe latest in a string of progressive candidates unseating deeply entrenched Democratic incumbents came from the state of Missouri on Tuesday where activist Cori Bush unseated 10-term congressman William Lacy Clay Jr. The 44-year-old nurse entered politics in the aftermath of the 2014 Ferguson protests and, after two failed attempts at running for office, pulled off a stunning victory over Clay, who had taken over the seat from his father before him. Bush's victory brings to an end the Clay family's 50-year hold on the seat in the heavily Democratic district.*\n\nThat means Bush will likely be the first Black woman to represent the state of Missouri in Congress. Before Tuesday's victory, Bush's transformation from activist into a winning candidate took a few turns: She mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the state Senate in 2016 and ran for Congress in 2018, losing to Clay by 20 points. During that race, Bush was featured in the Netflix documentary Knock Down the House that followed a handful of progressive women running for office, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThis time around, Bush raised far more money and amid national protests over the killing of George Floyd, rode a wave of Democratic enthusiasm for more progressive candidates primarying established incumbents. Following in Ocasio-Cortez's footsteps, Marie Newman unseated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in Illinois earlier this year and Jamaal Bowman ousted longtime New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel.\n\nCorrection, Aug. 5, 2020: This post originally misstated that the Clay family had held the seat for 40 years.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the 2020 races and politicians everyone's talking about this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, in which we take a lil' walk down recent memory lane to recount some of the more memorable upsets of the House primary season so far. With these races in the rearview, the Surge can reveal that it predicted the outcome in all of them, down to one-tenth of a decimal point.\n\nWe'll look at how progressives, despite getting dusted in the presidential primary, were at least able to knock off some House incumbents. We'll consider what the next House Republican conference will look like and wince. (Do you know what a \"biblical conservative\" is? If not, you're going to hell.) But we'll start with the most recent, and the most consequential, upset of the cycle.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nFor Democrats, urban districts in America's major cities are some of the safest seats in the country, and left-wing Democrats don't feel like they're always getting the most left-wing members out of them. This is the theory behind the raft of safe-seat progressive challengers backed by groups like Justice Democrats in the past two cycles. And the incumbents whom they'd been successful in ousting were, essentially, anachronisms: white Democrats representing what had become majority-minority urban districts. But left-wingers had much more trouble beating Black incumbents in safe, urban districts-and frankly, they had trouble beating safe-seat incumbents outside the Northeast. That's why activist Cori Bush's primary win this week over St. Louis Rep. Lacy Clay, a Black, 20-year member of Congress who replaced his father, Bill, in the seat he had held for 30 years, is an earthquake in Congressional Black Caucus politics. Clay had defeated Bush with ease in 2018 and was caught sleeping against her much more professionalized challenge this time around. Expect every safe-seat CBC member to face a well-funded primary next cycle, and expect those CBC members to take them seriously.\n\nDespite Cori Bush breaking new ground, this has not been the Most Awesome Year for the left. Bernie Sanders appeared to have the Democratic presidential nomination in his grasp heading into the South Carolina primary. Then the party snapped its fingers and within a week, Joe Biden had left Sanders in the dust. Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee got every candidate they wanted out of Senate primaries. By June, the left badly needed a meaningful win to show it was still a force worth taking seriously. It was generous, then, of longtime Rep. Eliot Engel-the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and one of those aforementioned ensconced, urban white guys in a majority-minority district-to stay at his Maryland home instead of in his New York district during the pandemic. And it was additionally kind of him to say other things -\"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care\" -that made him appear out-of-touch and in need of a fresh replacement. Jamaal Bowman, the Justice Democrats-endorsed challenger who won the primary, appreciated it too.\n\nThis one is ranked so highly for the simple reason that it confounds the Surge. GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman, a freshman elected in 2018 under a cloud of Bigfoot erotica, lost the party's nomination at an unusual drive-thru convention in June to challenger Bob Good, a self-described \"biblical conservative\" who carefully adheres to such scriptural edicts as making English the national language and eliminating birthright citizenship. Riggleman's sin? He officiated a same-sex marriage in 2019, a move that prompted a county Republican Party to disown him. So, yes, people do still get mad about that in 2020. The R+6 district, which stretches from north to south along a central strip of the Old Dominion, was vaguely competitive already and, with Good's nomination, will be truly competitive for Democrats in November. Riggleman's loss represents this cycle's entry in Virginia Republicans trying to secure their status as a permanent minority.\n\nThis upset was as notable for its mismanagement by the White House chief of staff as it was for its winner. North Carolina then-Rep. Mark Meadows announced he was retiring from his seat in the western part of the state just before the filing deadline in December, a move that local politicos suspected might have been timed to benefit his wife's friend, Lynda Bennett. Meadows and his wife, further, successfully convinced President Donald Trump to endorse Bennett. In the June runoff for the GOP nomination, though, Bennett went down to an upstart named Madison Cawthorn who, at 24 years old at the time of his win, was, by our calculations, one of the youngest people to have ever lived. Anytime one of America's youths wins a congressional seat, it's a good story. It's even better when that upset prompts Trump to yell at his chief of staff.\n\nThe next House Republican Conference-which, in all likelihood, will be the next House Republican minority-is going to be a spectacle heretofore unseen in American politics. Committee chair term limits and low expectations of retaking the majority have created a situation in which all of the House Republicans who know how to govern will be retired. People like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, considered objectionable cranks within the conference just a year ago, will continue to ascend in leadership. And who's coming in, aside from youths named Madison and \"biblical conservatives\"? Well, Lauren Boebert likely will be. Boebert, who knocked off incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton in this western Colorado district, is the owner of Shooters Grill, a bar and eatery in which the conceit is that everyone carries and shows off their guns. Boebert got some press by keeping her gun restaurant open in defiance of the governor's coronavirus lockdown orders. Boebert also is sympathetic to the QAnon conspiracy theory-and she's not the only competitive, or even likely , Republican candidate this cycle to share those sympathies. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, whom former Speaker John Boehner once described as \"insane\" and lacking a \"functional brain,\" is going to be the Pericles of the next House Republican Conference at this rate.\n\nHouse Republicans who have been trying to prove that they're not a racist bloc have had an annoying problem for the past 17 years: Anyone can just say, But you have Steve King in your conference as an effective rejoinder. Republican leaders were finally able to oust the consistently offensive lawmaker, though, by stripping him of his real source of power in northwestern Iowa, his committee assignments, and specifically his senior position on the House Agriculture Committee. With that gone, even Republican primary voters who had little problem with King's regular racist comments had to concede that those comments had stripped him of the ability to be effective for his district. Which is why state Sen. Randy Feenstra comfortably defeated King in the early June primary. It may be the end of King's nine-term tenure, but it's just the beginning of his quiet life in study of obscure Austrian racial theory.\n\nAnd now for that other Democratic member of an urban political machine who took over a seat from his father named \"Bill\" in the early part of this century and then lost it to a progressive challenger this year. Was Dan Lipinski's loss, though, really an upset? Lipinski only barely defeated his primary challenger, Marie Newman, in 2018, and Newman was sure to be stronger with a little more experience and ample resources behind her. After Newman defeated Lipinski in March, Lipinski claimed in his concession speech that he was \"shunned by my colleagues and other Democratic Party members and operators. I was shunned because of my pro-life stance. The pressure on the Democratic Party on the life issue has never been as great as it is now.\" Along these lines, the defeat of one of the last pro-life Democrats in Congress earned some tsk - tsking about how rigid the Democratic Party has become. Is it really a stunning display of narrow-mindedness, though, that primary voters in a comfortably Democratic district wanted a representative who shares a foundational belief of the Democratic Party?\n\nKeep up with the race for 2020 with Slate's weekly presidential campaign newsletter, written by Jim Newell.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, which was not invited to the bipartisan COVID party on Joe Manchin's \"houseboat\" (or $700,000 yacht ) and is now in the market for a new agent.\n\nIt was a wobbly week for the Democratic Party. After much consternation and infighting, Democrats found a way to extend the eviction moratorium, but the courts might kill it any second now. Party leaders are pleased with how they're getting their way in early primaries this year, but the early midterm polling is painting a grim picture for them overall. Most Democratic governors are not on a glide path toward impeachment for sexual harassment, retaliation, and creating generally toxic work environments, but one is. And while Barack Obama gets to celebrate his birthday, he won't do so in the spectacular fashion for which he'd hoped.\n\nFirst, though, let's look at one Democrat's quest to keep up the pressure on renewing the eviction moratorium, fleeting though the victory may ultimately be.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nWhy did both the White House and congressional Democrats wait until the last days before the CDC eviction moratorium expired to attempt to do anything about it? Probably because they believed that they couldn't do anything about it. But that didn't stop the last days of the moratorium from becoming an exercise in blame theatrics. The White House told Congress it needed to do something; House Democrats couldn't find the votes to do anything and told the administration that it needed to do something. No one did anything, and House members flew home. Or at least, most of them did. Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, a left-wing freshman member, stayed behind and spent days camped out on the Capitol steps until action was taken, with some relief from Reps. Jimmy Gomez, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Mondaire Jones. Bush's protest exemplified the rage of the left, pushing House Democratic leaders who in turn pushed the administration. On Tuesday, then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new order halting evictions in areas of the country where the delta variant is surging (no relation). The Surge has seen all sorts of Capitol Hill protests ( truly, all sorts ) that mostly exist for members to check the \"see? I protested\" box. Bush's, however, changed policy. We suspect this is not the last time a member chooses to camp out on the steps to get something done.\n\nBiden's first commentary on the new moratorium, meanwhile, was curious in that he suggested the policy might be a wee bit ... illegal. It's not just that the White House was hesitant to extend the moratorium-it had determined that it could not and had \"quadruple-checked\" the law before arriving at that decision. Though the Supreme Court had let the moratorium stand until its July 31 expiration, Justice Brett Kavanaugh had said that he didn't think the CDC had the authority to halt evictions in the first place and that further extensions would require legislative action. Though the new moratorium is different in some respects from the expired one, Biden still said at his press conference Tuesday that \"the bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster.\" But since Harvard's Laurence Tribe said it would be fine and because Democrats were in a pickle, the administration went ahead and did it anyway. This is why much of Democrats' celebration could prove premature. The same Realtors that challenged the previous moratorium have already filed suit against the new one, citing the White House and Biden's own (substantial) record of saying it might not be legal. The new eviction moratorium could be shot down in a matter of days-perhaps by the time you're reading this-and the judges shooting it down may not be polite in their treatment of the administration.\n\nAnother thing that could be ancient history by the time you read this: Andrew Cuomo's decade-plus rule of New York state. New York Attorney General Letitia James released her report into allegations of sexual harassment against the governor and \"concluded that Governor Cuomo did sexually harass multiple women-including former and current state employees-by engaging in unwanted groping, kissing, and hugging, and making inappropriate comments,\" as well as retaliate against \"at least one former employee.\" Whichever Democrats weren't already calling for Cuomo's resignation, from state lawmakers up through the president of the United States, are now calling for it. Cuomo's defense, meanwhile, was that he's just a touchy politician. To show he's not alone in that regard, he released pages and pages of photos of other politicians hugging and touching people. So he doesn't quite get it and seems determined to try to ride this out à la Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who similarly faced widespread calls to resign a couple of years ago when a photo purportedly depicting him in blackface emerged. A few key differences, though. First, the yearbook photo- investigations into which still couldn't conclusively prove it was Northam in blackface-was from decades earlier. Second, the entire Democratic line of succession behind Northam was tainted. Third, there was no movement from the Legislature to actually dump Northam. It's that last difference that's the most difficult for Cuomo. There's no chance he would resign just because he had a bunch of allies release statements asking him too. But the near-certainty of the Legislature ejecting him gives him no apparent path to survival. On the bright side: At least he got to be No. 3 on this list.\n\nAfter months of trailing in the polls for the special election in Ohio's 11 th Congressional District, Shontel Brown rallied to defeat progressive darling Nina Turner in Tuesday's Democratic primary. Aiding Brown in her victory were senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, former Rep. Marcia Fudge's mom, and most importantly, Nina Turner. The Democratic establishment-which prefers the term \"mainstream Democratic Party\"-is crowing at this latest defeat of the left, whose loss in the 2020 presidential primary has spilled over into 2021 with losses in the Virginia gubernatorial primary, New York mayoral primary, and now in Ohio. It cannot be overstated how much top Democratic politicians loathe the left tweeting shit at them all day. \"The extreme left is obsessed with talking trash about mainstream Democrats on Twitter, when the majority of the electorate constitute mainstream Democrats at the polls,\" New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic Caucus chairman, told the New York Times after Brown's win. \"In the post-Trump era, the anti-establishment line of attack is lame-when President Biden and Democratic legislators are delivering millions of good-paying jobs, the fastest-growing economy in 40 years and a massive child tax cut.\" Whether you agree with him or not, the center left, so far, is in total control of primaries heading into the midterm election cycle. But about that cycle ...\n\nA couple of candidate announcements this week caught the Surge's attention. In Missouri, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner, representing a biennially targeted suburban St. Louis district, announced she would run for House reelection instead of jumping into a crowded Senate primary. And in Maine, former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who once ran toward a ladies' room to avoid a question from the Surge about his Obamacare vote, announced he would challenge the Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, who unseated him in 2018. Moves like these indicate House Republicans see an early tailwind at their backs heading into the midterms. Another indicator of that? Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the DCCC chair, having polling that shows House Republicans have a tailwind at their back. \"During a closed-door lunch last week with some of his most vulnerable incumbents,\" Politico reported this week, Maloney \"delivered a blunt warning: If the midterms were held now, they would lose the majority.\" The polling showed House Democrats trailing Republicans on a generic ballot of battleground districts by a half-dozen points. It also indicated that while discrete elements of the Democratic economic agenda are widely popular, they're not breaking through, and concerns about inflation are hampering overall trust in Democrats' stewardship of the economy. The polling also showed that while discrete elements of the Democratic economic agenda are widely popular, they're not breaking through, and concerns about inflation are hampering overall trust in Democrats' stewardship of the economy. Just because House Republicans are off their rockers doesn't mean they can't comfortably take back the House.\n\nThe entire House of Representatives was on the verge of a dugout-clearing brawl before they adjourned for a much-needed August recess last week. Among the feuds lost amid the larger mask mandate wars and eviction moratorium scrambling, though, was one between 26-year-old freshman GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn-who was 25 just last week!-and humble West Virginia GOP Rep. Dave McKinley. The two nearly came to blows on the House floor as Cawthorn accused McKinley of attaching his name to a bill he didn't want to be on. \"What is your name?\" Cawthorn sarcastically asked McKinley, who responded, \"You know damn well who I am.\" McKinley, during the argument that ensued, would repeatedly call Cawthorn \"Junior.\" This came after Cawthorn had personally gone to McKinley's office and screamed at his staff, asking them if their boss was \"that guy with the mustache that nobody fucking knows,\" an incident that prompted a McKinley staffer to file an ethics complaint. It was also revealed this week that Cawthorn tried to bring a loaded gun onto a plane in February, which is not allowed. We would say that this arrogant junior member is spiraling downward and that it won't end well for him if he doesn't pull himself together. Another possibility, though: He keeps getting worse and never faces any consequences for his actions.\n\nWe think we've discovered why it took former President Barack Obama so long to pump out his memoirs: He spent 90 percent of his mental energy following his exit from the White House planning his 60 th birthday party. It was to be fabulous! Taking place at his 29-acre, $12 million Martha's Vineyard estate, Obama had expected 475 guests, including George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, and Steven Spielberg. The ultimate band of 60-year-old ex-presidents, Pearl Jam, was set to play. Who knows what else? Canapés made of solid gold; fine cigars lit with complimentary $1,000 bills; pony rides, except the ponies are spaceships, and the rides are to space. Drugs like you wouldn't believe. A decent Buffalo chicken dip. But alas, it was all a mirage, and Obama announced this week that he would cancel the big bash over rising COVID cases and instead have something small with family and close friends (Bono, Angela Merkel, the Surge, Bill Ayers, etc.). Maybe if Obama had simply *invited* the delta variant, it wouldn't have gone out of its way to ruin the whole thing.\n\nKeep up with what's going on in Washington with Slate's weekly political ranking, written by Jim Newell.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "CDC Unveils New Eviction Moratorium, but Biden Warns it May Not Survive Legal Challenges\n\nFacing lots of friendly fire from angry progressives, the White House decided to change course . After days of the Biden administration saying it couldn't do anything to save the eviction moratorium that lapsed over the weekend , it changed its mind Tuesday as activists and Democratic lawmakers increased pressure on the White House to act. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unveiled a new two-month, more limited moratorium on Tuesday at a time when the Delta variant is quickly spreading across much of the country. The ban would temporarily stop evictions in counties with \"substantial and high levels\" of virus transmissions, meaning it would cover around 90 percent of Americans who are renters , according to the White House. In justifying the measure the CDC said the new moratorium was needed because \"the evictions of tenants for failure to make rent or housing payments could be detrimental to public health control measures.\"\n\nThe new moratorium came after days of Biden saying he didn't have the legal authority to extend the measure. Even as he unveiled the measure, the president said he was unsure if it would survive legal challenges, noting experts aren't very optimistic . \"The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster,\" Biden said. \"But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it's worth the effort.\" The president said that regardless of what happens in the courts, the new moratorium would at least provide some temporary relief. And \"by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time\" so local governments can release billions of federal dollars in relief aid to renters. Congress has allocated $46.5 billion in rental assistance as part of two COVID-19 relief packages but only around $3 billion had been disbursed through June.\n\nThe change in tactics for the White House came amid a furious backlash from many Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, not to mention progressive activists. The pressure mounted after several Democrats joined Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri who had set up camp outside the Capitol for several days to demand action. Bush shed what she described as \"joyful tears\" after news of the temporary fix. \"My God, I don't believe we did this,\" Bush said. \"We just did the work, just by loving folks to keep millions in their homes.\" Many Democratic leaders praised Bush, a freshman congresswoman, for helping spark the pressure that led the White House to take action. \"I particularly applaud Rep. Cori Bush, who understands what it's like to be evicted and who took her passion and turned it into amazingly effective action,\" Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said. Bush has talked about how she was forced to live in her car as a young mother.\n\nHousing advocates praised the move while landlord groups blasted the administration . \"This is a tremendous relief for millions of people who were on the cusp of losing their homes and, with them, their ability to stay safe during the pandemic,\" said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. David Howard, executive director of the National Rental Home Council, in contrast, criticized the White House for creating \"more uncertainty\" for renters and owners.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A Powerful Lobbying Group Is Coming for Another Member of the Squad\n\nProgressive congresswoman and \"Squad\" member Cori Bush is in the fight for her political life in Missouri, hoping a grassroots campaign can fend off a well-funded primary challenge from local prosecutor and Democrat Wesley Bell. A key difference between these two Democrats is the backing of the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee: Bell has it, and Bush does not. The primary, which will be decided by voters on Tuesday, is another test of political might for the outside group determined to oust as many critics of Israel's war in Gaza from Congress as possible this election cycle.\n\nBush is the incumbent, holding Missouri's 1st Congressional District's seat since 2021, after wresting it from 10-term incumbent Democrat William Lacy Clay in a 2020 primary. In the process, she became the first Black congresswoman to represent Missouri and the first activist from the Black Lives Matter movement to earn a seat in Congress. She has been an unstinting voice on progressive issues from housing to policing to the Green New Deal. But since the beginning of Israel's war in Gaza, a response to the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas last year, Bush has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his tactics. She has consistently raised awareness of the more than 39,000 Palestinians killed and Israel's alleged violations of domestic and international laws. And most recently, Bush boycotted Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, along with nearly half of House and Senate Democrats, calling him a war criminal and calling his government's actions in Gaza a genocide.\n\nBush was among a bevy of lawmakers AIPAC planned to target in 2024 as part of a plan to spend $100 million to boost pro-Israel candidates in open seats and push out sitting representatives who are insufficiently deferential to Netanyahu. Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib-the only Palestinian American in Congress-were also on AIPAC's wish list, but all three women were quick to close ranks with impressive fundraising hauls and endorsements. Unable to recruit strong challengers in those races, AIPAC quietly backed off, choosing not to take any action (though they could still put money behind Omar's challenger, Don Samuels). Bush was not as fortunate.\n\nAIPAC entered Bush's primary by supporting Bell, who pledged to Bush in a leaked 2023 phone call that he would not run against her-and the group has collectively sunk nearly $12 million into the race, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. That spending has included a blitz of negative advertising across TV, radio, print, and phone-banking efforts-but the ads avoid all mention of Bush's criticisms of Israel. Last week, the Intercept reported that one of the mailers paid for by AIPAC visibly distorted Bush's facial features. (AIPAC rejects the claim.) \"The people of St. Louis deserve better than to see their first Black Congresswoman racistly distorted into a caricature,\" Bush said in a statement.\n\nBush has been unable to catch up with AIPAC's spending and fundraising; her campaign raised $2.9 million and had $354,000 in cash on hand as of July 17, while Bell raised $4.8 million and maintained $1.8 million in cash. Making matters worse for Bush is the fact that she's under three federal investigations for campaign finance violations, related to her campaign hiring her now-husband to work as her security guard. It's forced Bush to divert sorely needed campaign funds to foot her legal bills .\n\nBell, a prosecuting attorney for Missouri's St. Louis County, was initially running for the state's Senate seat against Republican Josh Hawley, but after five months in that race, he decided to drop out and run against Bush instead. That decision has pitted two Black, self-described progressives against each other in a blue pocket of a bright-red state. However, Bell's campaign doesn't see it that way. In an interview with Slate, Anjan Mukherjee, Bell's campaign adviser, said the prosecutor primaried Bush because he had been \"approached by people in the district and by folks in Washington who are fed up with Bush not representing this district.\"\n\nWhen it came to AIPAC's outsized involvement in Bell's race, Mukherjee tried to minimize its influence as it being simply one of multiple interest groups donating and spending on this race-to date, almost two-thirds of Bell's campaign donations have come from AIPAC bundling, according to Sludge. And, as Slate's Alex Sammon noted , AIPAC has strong links to Republican megadonors and billionaires, including donors to Donald Trump, who have contributed millions to the group's super PAC. That super PAC, United Democracy Project, is the top outside spender in the primary as well, in what has become the third most expensive House primary ever.\n\nMukherjee went on to criticize Bush for voting against President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill and for being one of the most absent lawmakers during vote days in the House. (From Jan. 2021 to July 2024, Bush missed 241 of 2,122 roll-call votes -about 11 percent. The median missed-vote rate is about 2 percent.)\n\nBush has defended her record by pointing to her vote for Biden's American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, which brought over $1.5 billion to St. Louis . That money was used to fund violence prevention programs, the state's first guaranteed income program, schools across the district, and more. Bush has also talked about getting signage installed at Coldwater Creek, a body of water in her district that's been contaminated with radioactive waste for decades. She's earned endorsements from top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the rest of House Democratic leadership. (Though they have not visited St. Louis to stump for Bush.) She has racked up local endorsements and support from labor unions, too.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Bell's and Bush's paths crossed as activists. The congresswoman participated in the Ferguson protests that came after a policeman shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014. Bell was a municipal court judge at the time and didn't participate in the protests, but he hosted discussions in the community to talk about the state of policing. Bush went on to run for Congress, while Bell ran for City Council and then became the first Black prosecuting attorney of St. Louis County. He ran with a campaign promise to prosecute the policeman charged with murdering Brown. But once in office, Bell declined to charge him. It's something Bush is using against Bell, with ads featuring the Brown family . \"I feel like he lied to us,\" Michael Brown Sr., Brown's father, says of Bell. \"He used my family for power and now he's trying to sell out St. Louis.\"\n\nBell has also been staunchly supportive of Netanyahu's war effort and has said he supports the U.S. continuing to send unconditional military aid to Israel. Of course, that issue has little salience in a district like Missouri's 1 st , which is majority Black, with few Republicans. And while AIPAC is clearly hoping to replicate the result from six weeks ago in New York's 16 th District, where Democrat and Squad member Jamaal Bowman lost his primary to moderate George Latimer after AIPAC spent $14 million in advertising attacking Bowman, those districts are very different.\n\nSo far, polling of the race has been all over the place, with results varying from Bush and Bell bieng in a dead heat to Bell holding a 20-plus-point lead. Bush has put up a serious fight, but if AIPAC has its way, and Bell triumphs, Tuesday's primary results will further empower the lobbying group to aggressively pursue lawmakers who do not fall in line with unconditional support for Israel.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the 2020 races and politicians everyone's talking about this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, in which we take a lil' walk down recent memory lane to recount some of the more memorable upsets of the House primary season so far. With these races in the rearview, the Surge can reveal that it predicted the outcome in all of them, down to one-tenth of a decimal point.\n\nWe'll look at how progressives, despite getting dusted in the presidential primary, were at least able to knock off some House incumbents. We'll consider what the next House Republican conference will look like and wince. (Do you know what a \"biblical conservative\" is? If not, you're going to hell.) But we'll start with the most recent, and the most consequential, upset of the cycle.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nFor Democrats, urban districts in America's major cities are some of the safest seats in the country, and left-wing Democrats don't feel like they're always getting the most left-wing members out of them. This is the theory behind the raft of safe-seat progressive challengers backed by groups like Justice Democrats in the past two cycles. And the incumbents whom they'd been successful in ousting were, essentially, anachronisms: white Democrats representing what had become majority-minority urban districts. But left-wingers had much more trouble beating Black incumbents in safe, urban districts-and frankly, they had trouble beating safe-seat incumbents outside the Northeast. That's why activist Cori Bush's primary win this week over St. Louis Rep. Lacy Clay, a Black, 20-year member of Congress who replaced his father, Bill, in the seat he had held for 30 years, is an earthquake in Congressional Black Caucus politics. Clay had defeated Bush with ease in 2018 and was caught sleeping against her much more professionalized challenge this time around. Expect every safe-seat CBC member to face a well-funded primary next cycle, and expect those CBC members to take them seriously.\n\nDespite Cori Bush breaking new ground, this has not been the Most Awesome Year for the left. Bernie Sanders appeared to have the Democratic presidential nomination in his grasp heading into the South Carolina primary. Then the party snapped its fingers and within a week, Joe Biden had left Sanders in the dust. Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee got every candidate they wanted out of Senate primaries. By June, the left badly needed a meaningful win to show it was still a force worth taking seriously. It was generous, then, of longtime Rep. Eliot Engel-the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and one of those aforementioned ensconced, urban white guys in a majority-minority district-to stay at his Maryland home instead of in his New York district during the pandemic. And it was additionally kind of him to say other things -\"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care\" -that made him appear out-of-touch and in need of a fresh replacement. Jamaal Bowman, the Justice Democrats-endorsed challenger who won the primary, appreciated it too.\n\nThis one is ranked so highly for the simple reason that it confounds the Surge. GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman, a freshman elected in 2018 under a cloud of Bigfoot erotica, lost the party's nomination at an unusual drive-thru convention in June to challenger Bob Good, a self-described \"biblical conservative\" who carefully adheres to such scriptural edicts as making English the national language and eliminating birthright citizenship. Riggleman's sin? He officiated a same-sex marriage in 2019, a move that prompted a county Republican Party to disown him. So, yes, people do still get mad about that in 2020. The R+6 district, which stretches from north to south along a central strip of the Old Dominion, was vaguely competitive already and, with Good's nomination, will be truly competitive for Democrats in November. Riggleman's loss represents this cycle's entry in Virginia Republicans trying to secure their status as a permanent minority.\n\nThis upset was as notable for its mismanagement by the White House chief of staff as it was for its winner. North Carolina then-Rep. Mark Meadows announced he was retiring from his seat in the western part of the state just before the filing deadline in December, a move that local politicos suspected might have been timed to benefit his wife's friend, Lynda Bennett. Meadows and his wife, further, successfully convinced President Donald Trump to endorse Bennett. In the June runoff for the GOP nomination, though, Bennett went down to an upstart named Madison Cawthorn who, at 24 years old at the time of his win, was, by our calculations, one of the youngest people to have ever lived. Anytime one of America's youths wins a congressional seat, it's a good story. It's even better when that upset prompts Trump to yell at his chief of staff.\n\nThe next House Republican Conference-which, in all likelihood, will be the next House Republican minority-is going to be a spectacle heretofore unseen in American politics. Committee chair term limits and low expectations of retaking the majority have created a situation in which all of the House Republicans who know how to govern will be retired. People like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, considered objectionable cranks within the conference just a year ago, will continue to ascend in leadership. And who's coming in, aside from youths named Madison and \"biblical conservatives\"? Well, Lauren Boebert likely will be. Boebert, who knocked off incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton in this western Colorado district, is the owner of Shooters Grill, a bar and eatery in which the conceit is that everyone carries and shows off their guns. Boebert got some press by keeping her gun restaurant open in defiance of the governor's coronavirus lockdown orders. Boebert also is sympathetic to the QAnon conspiracy theory-and she's not the only competitive, or even likely , Republican candidate this cycle to share those sympathies. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, whom former Speaker John Boehner once described as \"insane\" and lacking a \"functional brain,\" is going to be the Pericles of the next House Republican Conference at this rate.\n\nHouse Republicans who have been trying to prove that they're not a racist bloc have had an annoying problem for the past 17 years: Anyone can just say, But you have Steve King in your conference as an effective rejoinder. Republican leaders were finally able to oust the consistently offensive lawmaker, though, by stripping him of his real source of power in northwestern Iowa, his committee assignments, and specifically his senior position on the House Agriculture Committee. With that gone, even Republican primary voters who had little problem with King's regular racist comments had to concede that those comments had stripped him of the ability to be effective for his district. Which is why state Sen. Randy Feenstra comfortably defeated King in the early June primary. It may be the end of King's nine-term tenure, but it's just the beginning of his quiet life in study of obscure Austrian racial theory.\n\nAnd now for that other Democratic member of an urban political machine who took over a seat from his father named \"Bill\" in the early part of this century and then lost it to a progressive challenger this year. Was Dan Lipinski's loss, though, really an upset? Lipinski only barely defeated his primary challenger, Marie Newman, in 2018, and Newman was sure to be stronger with a little more experience and ample resources behind her. After Newman defeated Lipinski in March, Lipinski claimed in his concession speech that he was \"shunned by my colleagues and other Democratic Party members and operators. I was shunned because of my pro-life stance. The pressure on the Democratic Party on the life issue has never been as great as it is now.\" Along these lines, the defeat of one of the last pro-life Democrats in Congress earned some tsk - tsking about how rigid the Democratic Party has become. Is it really a stunning display of narrow-mindedness, though, that primary voters in a comfortably Democratic district wanted a representative who shares a foundational belief of the Democratic Party?\n\nKeep up with the race for 2020 with Slate's weekly presidential campaign newsletter, written by Jim Newell.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Congress Faces the Gut-Wrenching Facts of the Black Maternal Mortality Crisis\n\n\"I didn't think that there could even be a possibility that there could be a complication,\" Missouri Rep. Cori Bush told the House Oversight Committee Thursday. Bush was testifying to her colleagues about the premature birth of her own son, Zion, as part of a hearing focusing on America's ongoing Black maternal mortality crisis, as Congress considers the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020.\n\nBush and other speakers offered gut-wrenching testimonies about the realities of Black experience with pregnancy and childbirth. Black people who give birth in the U.S. are three times as likely to experience maternal death during or after delivery as their white peers, who themselves die at a higher rate than in any other comparably wealthy nation. There's no definitive reason for this atrocious outcome, but systemic racism, poor healthcare access, apathetic clinicians, and weathering all play a role in why the phenomenon transcends class and educational lines.\n\nIn a 2019 study on how birthing people are treated by clinicians, 22.5 percent of Black patients reported experiencing some type of mistreatment. Black babies are also at risk since they are more likely to be born premature and more likely to die when treated by white doctors. And when Black women have access to Black doulas, they are more likely to survive birth and the period afterward.\n\nThe Momnibus Act is a broad collection of nine separate bills aimed at improving Black maternal health outcomes. One bill is centered on addressing the social determinants of Black maternal health-like housing, nutrition, and transportation-by creating a task force to come up with solutions. A second bill focuses on funding community organizations, while a third seeks to recruit perinatal workers who reflect a variety of backgrounds. This includes support for Black doulas and lactation consultants.\n\nSuch data was given a specific, personal dimension in Thursday's testimony. Below are some of the stories, edited for length and clarity, from Bush, actor Tatyana Ali, and Charles Johnson, the husband of Kira Johnson and founder of 4Kira4Moms.\n\nRep. Cori Bush\n\nI sit here before you as a mother, a single mother of two. Zion, my eldest child was born at 23 weeks gestation versus what is considered a normal pregnancy of 40 weeks. When I was early in my pregnancy with him, I didn't think that there could even be a possibility that there could be a complication.\n\nI became sick during my pregnancy. I had hyperemesis gravidarum, which was severe nausea and vomiting. I was constantly throwing up for the first four months of my pregnancy. Around five months, I went to see my doctor for a routine prenatal visit. As I was sitting in the doctor's office, I noticed a picture on the wall that said, \"If you feel like something is wrong, something is wrong. Tell your doctor.\" I felt like something was wrong. So that's what I did, I told my doctor that I was having severe pains. And she said, \"Oh no, you're fine. You're fine. Go home. And I'll see you next time.\"\n\nI went home and, one week later, I went into preterm labor. At 23 weeks, my son was born at one pound, three ounces. His ears were still in his head. His eyes were still fused shut. His fingers were smaller than rice and his skin was translucent. A Black baby with translucent skin. You could see his lungs. He could fit within the palm of my hand.\n\nWe were told he had a zero percent chance of life. The chief of neonatal surgery happened to be in the hospital that morning and saw my case on the surgical board. And she decided to try to resuscitate him. It worked. For the first month of his life, Zion was on a ventilator fighting to live. For four months, he was in the neonatal care unit. The doctor who delivered my son apologized. She said, \"You were right. And I didn't listen to you. Give me another chance.\"\n\nTwo months later, I was pregnant again. So I went back to her. At 16 weeks, I went for an ultrasound at the clinic and saw a different doctor who was working that day. I found out again, I was in preterm labor. The doctor told me that the baby was going to abort. I said, \"No, you have to do something.\" But he was adamant.\n\n\"Just go home. Let it abort. You can get pregnant again because that's what you people do.\"\n\nMy sister Kelly was with me. We didn't know what to do after the doctor left. We saw chairs sitting in the hallway. My sister picked up the chair and she threw it down the hallway. Nurses came running from everywhere to see what was wrong. A nurse called my doctor and she put me on the stretcher. The next morning, my doctor came in and placed a cerclage on my uterus. And I was able to carry my baby, my daughter, my angel, who is now 20 years old.\n\nMy son who was saved is now 21 years old.\n\nThis is what desperation looks like-that chair flying down a hallway. This is what being your own advocate looks like. Every day, Black women are subjected to harsh and racist treatment during pregnancy and childbirth. Every day, Black women die because the system denies our humanity. It denied us patient care.\n\nTatyana Ali\n\nI had a very healthy pregnancy and, when it came time, I was laboring and dilating normally. When my husband and I got to the hospital, it was like we were on a clock. I kept very close track of the hours. I remember [the clinicians] trying to get me to take an epidural though it wasn't in my birth plan, interrupting me again and again, in the midst of my labor pains and making it seem imperative until finally we relented. I wanted to get onto my hands and knees to push because I could still feel my legs. But every time I tried five of the 10 people in the room, all screaming at me, at the top of their lungs, would push me back down. They'd pin me down by my feet.\n\nI could feel my baby's wet hair here because he'd been crowned for hours. One doctor climbed up onto the side of the bed, pushed his forearm into my belly, squeezed downward. I could still feel the pain days later. And when my husband and I yelled no to the forceps, they used suction-a plunger. I screamed stop because they were aggressively popping it off of his head again and again. Without warning, one doctor pushed my baby all the way back inside me. I screamed in pain. My body started shaking uncontrollably, then I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I heard my baby cry.\n\n\"That's our baby,\" I told my husband, \"Don't let them hurt him. Go, go and get him.\" Then I went unconscious again.\n\nI remember the warmth that washed over me when I finally got to hold him. I remember two nurses, in particular, in the maternity ward who were kind and gentle with me. He spent four days in the NICU. The head pediatric urologist explained to us that it would take time for our baby to urinate on his own because of the traumatic nature of his birth. Our prayers were answered when he did and we could leave.\n\nWhen we found out we were pregnant again we had to find another way. The first time we met our midwife, I felt like I had met her before. She's a brilliant Black woman with a beautiful smile. Her laugh reminds me of my very own cousin, Valerie. I remember her spending hours with us visiting our home, helping my eldest as he was just learning to walk up the stairs on his own. I remember her asking for permission every time she touched my belly and never using a speculum or getting an intra-vaginal check, like my OBGYN did at every appointment. We decided to have a home birth and she gave us choices. She was a reservoir of information, never too busy to take a call or answer a text.\n\nLast minute, my youngest changed his position and went lateral. I had to have another C-section, but we had planned so thoroughly that we knew exactly which hospital would respect our team. When I broke down weeping after the anesthesiologist said I would feel nothing from the chest down again, my midwife prayed and held my feet. She knew my story and prepared me for the time when the trauma of my birth might return. She also knows that I believe in prayer. She knew me that well. She suggested that I walk into the OR instead of being put on a gurney in order to feel a sense of agency and autonomy that had been taken from me previously.\n\nI got to hold my youngest right after she entered the world. She latched right away. During postpartum visits with our midwife, she provided lactation support. She checked in on my baby's growth, my physical wellness, my nutrition, my mental and emotional wellbeing, and how we were adjusting as a family. Both my babies were born via be a C-section, but the experiences could not have been more diametrically opposed. My eldest and I were not safe. My youngest and I, cared for by a Black midwife, were.\n\nThe birth of my oldest was my first experience of a kind of institutionalized racism and paternalism that can kill. Throughout my advocacy efforts, I've heard firsthand stories of people in pain being dismissed, threatened, and called drug seeking. I've heard stories of the sheriff's department coming to homes in the middle of the night because families refuse to take elective tests. I've heard stories of child services being called moments after babies are born because the parents seem unfit. The similarities amongst Black families and the treatment and similar outcomes for indigenous families and queer families and disabled families and incarcerated working people are stunning and they all have similar root causes.\n\nAll pregnant and birthing people deserve to be treated with loving, patient-centered care.\n\nCharles Johnson\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet a woman who absolutely changed my life. And so when we talk about my wife Kira, we're talking about sunshine personified. We're talking about a woman who raised cars, who ran marathons, who spoke five languages fluently, and really challenged me to be a better man in every single aspect of my life. I've always wanted to be a father. And so I was ecstatic when we found that we were welcoming our son Charles V in September 2014. Kira and I always talked about how cool it would be to have back-to-back boys who would grow up being rambunctious best friends.\n\nWe were absolutely over the moon when we found out we were welcoming our second son, Langston, in April 2016.\n\nThe painful irony is that, as a father and as a husband, you want the best for your family. You want the best for your wife. So we made the decision to give birth at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles because it was our understanding that this hospital had what was supposed to be a sterling reputation, particularly in the area of obstetrics and delivery.\n\nOn April 12th, 2016, we walked into [the hospital] on what we expected to be the happiest day of our lives and walked straight into a nightmare. It's important to understand that throughout Kira's entire pregnancy, she was not only in good health, she was in exceptional health. All signs pointed to both her and Langston being extremely healthy. So at our doctor's recommendation, we went in for a routine scheduled C-section. Langston was born perfectly healthy-10 fingers, 10 toes, and we were overwhelmed with joy welcoming this tremendous gift into our lives.\n\nShortly after birth, we were taken back to recovery, which is standard in a cesarean delivery. Kira was resting. I was watching her rest and Langston was in the incubator. And I was just soaking in the pride of being a father for the second time. Our family was finally complete.\n\nThen things began to take a turn for the worst. As I'm sitting there watching Kira rest, the catheter coming from her bedside began to turn pink with blood. This is around four o'clock in the afternoon. I brought it to the attention of the doctors and staff and they examined Kira physically. They took her vitals. They drew blood and they did an ultrasound. And very early on, they could see that her abdomen is beginning to fill with fluid. They ordered a CT scan. It was supposed to be performed ... immediately.\n\nFive o'clock came. No CT scan. Six o'clock came, seven o'clock came. No scan. By seven o'clock, my wife is shivering uncontrollably because she's losing so much blood. Eight o'clock comes. No scans. I'm begging and pleading, \"Please do something! Help her!\" At around nine o'clock, I pulled a nurse aside and I asked her to, \"Please help me. My wife isn't doing well. She's weak. She's in pain. She's losing color. Please help me.\"\n\nAnd she responded to me, \"Sir, your wife just isn't a priority right now.\"\n\nYour wife isn't a priority.\n\nTen o'clock came. 11 o'clock came. And it wasn't until after 12:30 AM that they finally made the decision to take Kira back for surgery. When they opened her up, there were three and a half liters of blood in my wife's abdomen from where she'd been allowed to bleed and suffer needlessly for 10 hours.\n\nCries for help fell on deaf ears.\n\nAs I said when I was here in 2018, in support of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act-and I'm  gonna say it again-you're gonna hear from brilliant people, many of whom I look up to tremendously. And they're gonna tell you about the statistics. But there's no statistic that can quantify what it's like to tell an 18 month old that his mommy's never coming home. There's no point in your data collection that can begin to measure the impact of what it is like to try to explain to a son who will never know his mother just how amazing she is.\n\nI'm going to share with this committee a harsh truth: For all the wonderful work that you're doing. You cannot legislate compassion. It was lack of compassion and lack of humanity that failed my wife and is failing Black mothers time and time again.\n\nIt was not my wife's race that was a risk factor. She did everything right. It was racism. That was the risk factor. We must do better.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBush is one of a growing number of Black progressives likely headed to Congress.\n\nby Aaron Ross Coleman\n\nCori Bush's stunning primary upset over Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in Missouri's First District underscored a generational split that has cracked through American electoral politics.\n\nOver the last six years, the tension between the younger Black Lives Matter generation and the historic civil rights guard has been well documented as iconoclasts like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson clashed with younger activists over everything from movement objectives and speaking time to paying for protest permits and port-a-potties .\n\nBush, a 44-year-old single mother, nurse, and leader in the 2014 Ferguson uprising , ousted 64-year-old, 10-term incumbent Clay in the St. Louis-area district. The bout was a rematch of the 2018 race, which Clay won by a 20-point margin. Both candidates are Black. However, Bush's candidacy this time spoke to the moment, with her connections to a movement sweeping the nation following the killing of George Floyd and the sustained protests since the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, a city in the district.\n\nIt's tempting to paint Bush's victory as solely about the candidates' differing engagement with the Black Lives Matters movement. Ferguson activists describe Clay as absent from the local protests in recent years, and Clay has eschewed activists' calls to \"defund the police.\" Beyond policing, however, Bush also represented an anti-corporate insurgency that has been brewing in the Democratic Party more broadly.\n\n\"In any primary challenge, you have to tell voters why the incumbent is out of touch,\" said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, a national PAC that supported Bush and aims to challenge incumbent Democrats from the left in primaries. \"Cori hit him on numerous vulnerabilities, which included that he opposed President Obama's efforts on reining in predatory lending - Clay was taking money from the predatory lenders.\"\n\nClay is in some ways firmly in the progressive camp, supporting Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal. But like many other Democrats and Congressional Black Caucus members, he has extensive connections to a cadre of corporate funders. Clay opposed the Obama administration's efforts to fight the payday lending industry, and his fundraising traces deep connections to big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and lobbyists like the American Financial Services Association . Similarly, news accounts have linked the Congressional Black Caucus's fundraising to companies including BP, General Motors, Philip Morris, and Coca-Cola.\n\nAhead of the election, Bush and her allies dug in on Clay's corporate connections with an anti-monopoly group running ads billing Clay as part of the problem of corporate money \"Corrupting American Democracy.\" Shahid said this was part of the core message that helped put Bush over the top.\n\nBush's victory is of massive import due to her unabashed progressive politics (the Democratic Socialists of America celebrated her victory) and deep roots in racial justice activism. She joins candidates like Mondaire Jones and Jamaal Bowman as Black progressives who have toppled or replaced more establishment Democrats this year.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus includes some of the most liberal members of Congress, but some may not support certain progressive priorities, such as taking on corporate interests. Bush's win over Clay may foreshadow potential challenges for other Black members who have held onto safe seats in deep blue Democratic districts for decades.\n\nClay has had a tenuous relationship with the demands of younger Black Lives Matter activists. As the Washington Post noted in 2014, he was among the Democrats who voted not to demilitarize the police . The 2014 amendment to a Department of Defense appropriations bill would have stopped the military from dispensing armored vehicles and heavy weapons like grenade launchers, silencers, and toxicological agents to local police forces. The bill failed by a wide margin, just two months before the Ferguson protests, when police tanks would roll through the city streets.\n\nIt's a sharp contrast with the work of Bush, a front-liner in Ferguson's fight to gain justice for Michael Brown. Rodney Brown, a community organizer with United Congregations of Metro-East, who also got his start after the Michael Brown killing, says that Bush is a fixture in local activism and that her victory is a watershed moment for the progressive causes they've been fighting for. Brown describes this election as a natural outgrowth of the last six years of activism and organizing over St. Louis campaigns for new prosecutors, bail relief, and jail closures.\n\n\"At this moment, we finally have the world's attention, and we're saying like, we're here, Cori is in the house, and they're going to have to listen. Cori had a lot of supporters, a lot of people who love her, and who are going to protect her. Cori has a lot of people who are ready to claim the dream that we've all been speaking about.\"\n\nBush has pledged to meld her movement protest politics into her work as a legislative representative.\n\n\"Almost six years ago to this day, Mike Brown was murdered,\" Bush said in her election night speech. \"Murdered by the police in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. I was maced and beaten by those same police officers in those same streets. Six months from now, as the first Black congresswoman in the entire history of the state of Missouri. I'll be holding every single one of them accountable.\"\n\n\"We've been called radicals, terrorists,\" she continued. \"We've been dismissed as an impossible fringe movement - that's what they called us. But now we are a multiracial, multiethnic, multigenerational, multi-faith mass movement, united in demanding change, in demanding accountability, in demanding that our police, our government, our country, recognize that Black lives matter.\"\n\nThis movement-based mission, seeking the ideal combination of protest and politics, is aligned with a long struggle for Black freedom. Just last week at John Lewis's funeral, former President Barack Obama lionized Lewis's ability to straddle both worlds and urged more Americans to do the same.\n\n\"Like John, we don't have to choose between protest and politics,\" Obama said. \"It is not an either-or situation; it is a both-and situation. We have to engage in protests where that is effective, but we also have to translate our passion and our causes into laws and institutional practices.\"\n\nObama also underscored the need to fight political apathy and vote. \"We have got to be honest with ourselves that too many of us choose not to exercise the franchise,\" he said. \"Too many of our citizens believe their vote won't make a difference, or they buy into the cynicism that, by the way, is the central strategy of voter suppression, to make you discouraged, to stop believing in your own power.\"\n\nIn many ways, Obama was echoing arguments made by Martin Luther King Jr., who favored using direct action in combination with traditional legislative activism. In Why We Can't Wait , King argued that \"bringing about passage of a new and broad law by a city council, state legislature or congress, or pleading cases before the courts of the land does not eliminate the necessity for bringing about the mass dramatization of injustice in front of city hall. Indeed, direct action and legal action complement one another; when skillfully employed, each becomes more effective.\"\n\nThis idea of a balanced political strategy tempered by traditional legal action and direct action seeks to utilize the benefits of both forms of participation. However, from the end of the civil rights movement until the Ferguson protests, direct action tactics fell out of vogue in Black politics as strategies shifted to voting and lobbying.\n\nCity University of New York's Frances Fox Piven describes this process by which Black advocacy organizations discontinued the use of nonviolent direct action and \"were absorbed into the electoral and bureaucratic politics and became the ideological proponents of the shift 'from protest to politics.'\" Likewise, the Harvard-trained lawyer and civil rights activist Theodore Cross also charted the shift in The Black Power Imperative , explaining that \"voting, of course, had brought to blacks a brand-new form of power. Now that they had access to the ballot, many black people believed that traditional pressure and direct strategies were no longer needed or necessary.\"\n\nAfter decades of political participation premised upon voting, though, many long-standing racial inequalities still remain. Citing this political stagnation, Black leftist critics have argued for a paradigm shift toward a public that is more premised on activism, making the case for candidates like Bush.\n\n\"After 40 years of this electoral strategy, Black elected officials' inability to alter the poverty, unemployment, and housing and food insecurity their Black constituents face casts significant doubt on the existing electoral system as a viable vehicle for Black liberation,\" Princeton's Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor wrote in the book From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation . \"Not only did the Ferguson rebellion expose the racism and brutality of American policing, but it also exposed Black elected officials' inability to intervene effectively on behalf of poor and working-class African Americans.\"\n\nAs just one member in the House of Representatives, Bush may not suddenly enact big change on these issues, but half a decade after the killing of Michael Brown and amid a new push of racial justice protest, Cori Bush's political vision signals a real shift.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

William Lacy Clay Jr., in this year's primary for Missouri's First District, which covers the Democratic stronghold of St. Louis. Insofar as Bush won an election as a Democrat in St. Louis, that's not too surprising. But as Aaron Ross Coleman wrote for Vox at the time , Bush's victory in the primary was a surprising upset - one spurred by her strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement:\n\nBush, a 44-year-old single mother, nurse, and leader in the 2014 Ferguson uprising , ousted 64-year-old, 10-term incumbent Clay in the St. Louis-area district.

As Ella Nilsen wrote for Vox :\n\nA new group of Black progressives has officially been elected to Congress.\n\nIt's been a year defined in part by nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

They are making history; they'll be the first Black openly gay members of Congress once they're sworn in next year.\n\nBush and Bowman each defeated powerful, longtime members of Congress in stunning upsets earlier this year. Bowman soundly defeated powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel while Bush beat longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., a powerful senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus who had been in office since 2000. Bush was inspired to run by the 2014 police shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, something she remembered in her primary victory speech this summer.\n\n\"Almost six years ago to this day, Mike Brown was murdered,\" Bush said in her primary election night speech . \"Murdered by the police in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. I was maced and beaten by those same police officers in those same streets. Six months from now, as the first Black congresswoman in the entire history of the state of Missouri, I'll be holding every single one of them accountable.\"\n\nThe last year has laid bare long-standing racial inequalities in jobs, policing, and health care - in places from New York City to Ferguson, Missouri. Now that these candidates are officially on their way to Congress in a few months, they have big plans for how to tackle some of the country's biggest challenges facing Black and brown Americans, like systemic racism.\n\nBowman, for one, told Vox in an interview this summer that he wants Congress to take up a \"third-time's-the-charm sort of approach to reconstruction.\"\n\n\"We tried it after the Civil War, but it was stopped by Klansmen and white supremacists really targeting and terrorizing Black communities,\" the middle school principal and presumptive member of Congress for New York's 16th Congressional District told Vox . \"We tried it again after the civil rights movement, but that was followed by mass incarceration.\"\n\nBowman grew up in public housing in New York City and has spent the last 20 years as a public school educator and administrator in the Bronx, where he's mentored many low-income students. He sees systemic racism in the everyday lives of many residents in his community: in inadequate school funding. in segregated school districts and neighborhoods, in crumbling public housing.\n\nIt's that lived experience - and voters' desire for representatives who understand it - that's driving the wave of Black candidates to Congress. And this new class of progressives will only expand the power of the left to influence legislation. They'll add to \"the Squad,\" the group of progressives in Congress that includes Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY), Rashida Tlaib (MI), Ilhan Omar (MN), and Ayanna Pressley (MA).\n\n\"I've been an educator for 20 years. I'm a working-class person,\" Bowman told Vox. \"The new generation is driven by the grassroots, is driven by the working class, and is driven by the needs of those in our district who have been at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder for far too long.\"\n\nCorrection, November 4 : A headline appearing in internet search results incorrectly included South Carolina Senate candidate Jaime Harrison as among those elected to Congress.

      "text": "The significance of electing working-class politicians\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe pandemic has underscored why diversity in Congress - including class - is so crucial.\n\nby Terry Nguyen\n\nThe political future of Jamaal Bowman, the newly elected Congress member from the Bronx, seems bright. The progressive New York Democrat, who defeated a 16-term incumbent to win his race, is one of two new additions to \"the Squad,\" alongside Reps. Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. His financial reality is much less glamorous, during the transition phase, at least. Bowman told The Cut in December that the changeover has been \"stressful for [his] family.\" He is juggling a mortgage in Yonkers, a rental apartment in DC, student loans, and monthly bills.\n\nOne of the optimistic outcomes of the 2020 election, an event that has stubbornly refused to recede into distant memory, is the historic level of political representation in the 117th Congress. The new class arrived for the job when political tensions are high, made more complicated following the Capitol riot that some say their fellow lawmakers encouraged.\n\nIncreased diversity - of gender, race, sexual orientation, and age - among the ranks of top lawmakers can facilitate more inclusive and comprehensive policy decisions. There is one demographic, however, that has received less emphasis in political representation: class.\n\nDuring a crisis that has exacerbated economic inequality between blue-collar wage earners and white-collar professionals, a politician's class identity is perhaps even more decisive. Identity \"directly impacts how laws are written when people bring the confluence of their lived and professional experiences and those lenses to policymaking tables,\" Rep. Pressley (D-MA) told the Washington Post Magazine in March 2020. \"Different questions are asked. More-robust legislation is written. And everyone benefits from that.\"\n\nThe election of vocal, progressive officials like Bowman (a former school principal), Ocasio- Cortez (a former bartender), and Missouri Rep. Cori Bush (a former nurse) suggests that modern-day national politics has become slightly more accessible to working-class people. It might be, at least among Democrats, with the help of groups like Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, and the Working Families Party, which seek to recruit progressive candidates who reflect their local community. But for much - if not all - of American political history, the structure of the campaign system creates a built-in bias against the success of working-class candidates. Even if they do succeed, these politicians are privy to criticisms about their appearance and doubts about their upbringing.\n\nIt doesn't help that Americans don't know how to talk about class. Sixty-eight percent of households identify as \"middle class,\" and politicians, in an effort to appeal to broad constituencies, are verbosely vague about class differences. American culture and politics, as the New Yorker's Jelani Cobb wrote in 2016, \"have elided the differences between salaried workers and those who are paid hourly, between college-educated professionals and those whose purchasing power is connected to membership in a labor union.\"\n\nThere also isn't a consensus on what social class is or how it's defined. In 2015, the Pew Research Center defined the middle class as those whose annual household income is two-thirds to double the national median, or about $42,000 to $126,000 annually. And while class status can be compared in income and wealth data, people often have perceptions of class based on education and other identity factors, such as race and gender .\n\nBy and large, national politicians are wealthier and better educated than the average American: 95 percent of House members and 100 percent of Senate members have a bachelor's degree or higher, compared with about 35 percent of regular people. (There doesn't seem to be much of a relationship between good governance and educational attainment, as political philosopher Michael Sandel has noted .)\n\nMembers of Congress are responsible for delivering policies - on housing and health care, for instance - that could radically improve their constituents' lives during a pandemic . With the latest round of stimulus checks, some voters argued that their representatives haven't struggled enough financially to grasp the value of a $2,000 or $600 check.\n\nThe end-of-year standoff between Democrats and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to increase the amount to $2,000 - and the support some Republicans have expressed for bigger checks - highlights a bipartisan recognition that Americans are in a state of financial crisis. Former Georgia Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who lost their respective runoff races in January, supported the $2,000 checks, a move intended to sway working-class Georgians.\n\nMany Washington lawmakers have a history of downplaying their wealth when it's politically expedient. Instead of focusing on policy as a way to appeal to voters, they seek to cultivate a relatable \"I can grab a beer with them\" persona. For example, Loeffler, who was one of the richest members of Congress, worked as a Wall Street executive and married the chair of the New York Stock Exchange. But her political story begs to differ : She highlights her roots as a farm girl who waitressed her way through school to learn the value of a paycheck.\n\n\"Working-class people almost never become politicians,\" Nicholas Carnes, a Duke associate professor of public policy and political science, wrote for Vox in 2018. \"[Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez and [Randy] Bryce make headlines in part because their economic backgrounds are so unusual (for politicians, that is).\" (Carnes's article was published in October 2018, before the midterms in which Ocasio-Cortez won and Bryce lost.)\n\nAnd even after candidates like Ocasio-Cortez are elected to Congress, many remain susceptible to the endless circus of media scrutiny by pundits, critics, and online trolls critical of their politics - and appearance. \"There's a huge aspect of gender and class bias built into political perception,\" said Philip Chen, an associate professor of political science at Beloit College. \"We're starting to see a bit more gender consciousness with the media, but pundits and a lot of constituents still have certain biases baked in.\"\n\nMore politicians, particularly those on the left, are publicly embracing their working-class roots, said Chen. \"It's not that there weren't working-class politicians in the past. There obviously have been, but the relevance to identity was not as pronounced,\" he said. The strength of Bernie Sanders's campaign encouraged more Democratic politicians to directly address the issue of class, something activists have long emphasized. For some newer, progressive members of Congress, \"That's a big part of their electoral persona and appeal,\" Chen said.\n\nCori Bush, for example, recently rebuked some of her Republican colleagues for refusing to pass through metal detectors. \"Have you ever had a job before?\" she wrote on Twitter. \"If you work at McDonald's and you don't wear the uniform, you don't work that day. If you won't abide by the rules of this job, go find another one.\" This comment followed part of a debate about congressional rules on carrying firearms - rules some lawmakers don't seem to feel apply to them - and made Bush's callout all the more relevant on questions of class and entitlement.\n\nHaving an outspoken public persona can invite criticism, especially for elected officials with larger social media presences, which can range from valid judgments to bad-faith condemnations. Historically, women politicians have received undue attention for their appearance compared to their male colleagues. But working-class women, particularly women of color, are often subject to accusations that single them out as elitist or unreflective of their financial backgrounds.\n\nIt seems as though every time a politician poses for a photo shoot in an expensive designer outfit they're given to wear briefly (courtesy of a magazine), a subset of political Twitter explodes in outrage. During Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 campaign, a Washington Examiner columnist posted a photo of her with the caption, \"I'll tell you something: that jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles.\"\n\nThe dissonance, as Gaby Del Valle observed for Vox in 2018 , is reflective of a sinister yet vague disdain for working-class people: \"It doesn't matter where the clothing was purchased or how much the house cost; what matters is whether someone looks 'poor,'\" Del Valle wrote. \"The underlying message here is that if working people own anything beyond the bare minimum, then they're not really struggling.\"\n\nThis sort of partisan fury online seems misdirected toward politicians like Ocasio-Cortez, especially when many of her colleagues own second homes or are millionaires themselves: Loeffler, the former Georgia senator, was investigated by the Justice Department for potential insider trading after she sold millions of dollars in stocks following a private briefing on the coronavirus in January 2020.\n\nAs new members of Congress - especially those who might not have traditional political experience - garner media coverage, Chen expects topics such as housing affordability and financial security to arise more frequently. In November, Bush, then a representative-elect, declared on Twitter that \"the reality of being a regular person going to Congress\" is expensive, particularly when it comes to assembling an appropriate business wardrobe. Other members of Congress jumped in to recommend clothing rental sites or thrifting hacks, practical solutions to a very real problem.\n\nOcasio-Cortez similarly expressed that her transition period was \"very unusual\" because she had to live without a salary for three months before she was sworn in. In 2018, she told the New York Times she was concerned about how to get an apartment, saying, \"Those little things are very real.\"\n\n\"Working people absolutely think about housing security or whether they can reinvent their wardrobe to start a new job,\" Chen told me. \"It's a useful reminder when it comes to the role class plays, since these are things middle- to upper-class people don't usually think about.\"\n\nThe media attention that surrounds the material uncertainty of a handful of representatives might seem excessive, but the lack of such concerns - at least those surfaced by first-time politicians - is perhaps a clearer indication of their wealth and comfort, and it feeds into our expectations of their class status. But as more \"regular people\" run campaigns and win elections, these very real issues become part of a politician's story and, to a larger extent, their platform.\n\n\"We haven't changed anything about the way that we fund our elected officials,\" Chen said. \"It's the change in media coverage, candidate recruitment, and awareness of what it means to transition into this new lifestyle.\"\n\nCulture reflects society.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nMissouri voters go to the polls Tuesday, as a generational fight is brewing in St. Louis.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nMissouri voters go to the polls Tuesday to choose a wide range of Democratic and Republican candidates, including gubernatorial candidates for both parties.\n\nOne of the most closely watched races is a rematch between Rep. William Lacy Clay, the long-serving Democratic representative of Missouri's First Congressional District and the scion of a St. Louis political dynasty, and Cori Bush, a nurse who unsuccessfully challenged Clay in the 2018 Democratic primary.\n\nAt first glance, Bush resembles candidates such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) or Democratic congressional candidate Jamaal Bowman, who defeated veteran Democratic congressmen and who ran as unabashed progressives. Bush is two decades younger than the 64-year-old Clay, and she seeks a seat that a single family has held for more than half a century.\n\nLacy Clay entered Congress in 2001, succeeding his father Bill Clay, who was first elected to the House in 1968. The elder Clay is one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus .\n\nBut unlike several other highly watched Democratic primaries over the last two years, the race between Clay and Bush is perhaps more of a generational dispute than a battle over ideology. Clay describes himself as \"one of the more progressive members of Congress since my first day.\" He supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. He is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and he received their endorsement in his race against Bush.\n\nWhen I asked Clay's campaign what they view as the primary policy differences between the incumbent Congress member and Bush, they sent me a lengthy statement from Clay touting his endorsements from groups such as Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, Equality PAC (a pro-LGBTQ group associated with the Congressional LGBTQ Equality Caucus), and the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nClay touts himself as \"the only candidate in this race who has helped 22 million Americans gain healthcare coverage and helped double the federal investment in community-based health centers,\" and as \"the only candidate in this race who has stood up to the NRA and authored landmark legislation to give local governments the power to enact their own gun regulations.\"\n\nBush, meanwhile, organized protests in Ferguson , Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, and was an outspoken supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during the senator's 2016 presidential bid. She was endorsed by Bowman, the New York candidate who recently unseated Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) . Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Bush in 2018 .\n\nThough Bush's campaign does not deny that Clay supports many progressive priorities, its critique of him echoes the views of many Sanders supporters who viewed the Vermont senator's opponents as latecomers to leftist causes. \"We saw in the presidential primary the limitations of Democrats\" for whom it is \"easy and safe to co-sponsor a bill,\" said Keenan Korth, a spokesperson for the Bush campaign.\n\nPolicy aside, Korth also touts Bush as the \"protest-to-politics candidate\" in the race. Bush is \"not going to come to Congress and then stop attending these protests until we finally address this pandemic of police brutality.\"\n\nThe 2018 race did not end well for Bush, with Clay defeating Bush by nearly 20 points . Like Clay, Bush is Black, but as St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum notes , \"Bush prevailed in a number of either majority white or integrated areas of the 1st District in 2018,\" but Clay \"dominated in a number of Black city wards and county townships.\"\n\nNow, however, Bush has the experience of her 2018 race under her belt, as well as the greater name recognition that comes from having challenged Clay before. Bush was also featured in Knock Down the House , a Netflix documentary highlighting left challengers to incumbent Democrats.\n\nShe remains the underdog, but so were Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman.\n\nIncumbent Gov. Mike Parson (R) rose to power under the worst possible circumstances: His predecessor Eric Greitens (R) resigned due to allegations that he coerced a woman into performing oral sex on him and then threatened her to keep her quiet. Parson was lieutenant governor when Greitens left office, putting him next in line for the state's top job.\n\nParson now hopes to be elected to his first full term in his current job. He faces three primary challengers, including state Rep. Jim Neely (R) .\n\nMeanwhile, five candidates hope to receive the Democratic nomination for the governor's race, but state auditor Nicole Galloway is likely to prevail. One local news report said that Galloway is \" considered the runaway favorite to face Mike Parson \" in November.\n\nPolls, meanwhile, show Parson as likely - but hardly certain - to prevail over Galloway in this increasingly red state. The Real Clear Politics polling average on this race shows Parson leading Galloway by just over six points .\n\nOne other underdog worth keeping an eye on is Wick Thomas, a candidate in the state house's 19th District. That race pits Thomas, a self-described \" transgender, non-conforming candidate ,\" against incumbent state Rep. Ingrid Burnett (D). If elected, Thomas could become one of a handful of openly transgender candidates elected to a state legislature.\n\nThomas combines a kind of shock-your-parents vibe with a strikingly wholesome professional life. They lead a punk band named Wick and the Tricks , but they also worked as a youth librarian for the Kansas City Public Library. In 2015, after Gov. Jay Nixon (D) cut library spending, Thomas led a group of teens to the governor's office to protest - where they were eventually escorted out by state troopers .\n\nThomas was also named the \" Best Activist in Missouri \" in 2008 by The Pitch, a Kansas City alternative newspaper, for their work with teenagers and at-risk youth.\n\nFinally, Missouri voters will decide whether to make their state the 38th to expand Medicaid under Obamacare - something the state's Republican leaders have resisted. About 230,000 people could gain health coverage if the voters support Medicaid expansion.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nFrom reforming police funding to setting up postal banking, these progressives say racial justice is at the core of their work.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas and Li Zhou\n\nJust one year ago, America was not ready to consider the possibilities of bold racial justice reform. Discussion of reparations, a system that would redress the country's oldest sin of slavery, or universal basic income, a guarantee of economic security, were just talking points on the campaign trail for candidates vying to be president.\n\nIt would take the acutely distressing events of the following months to help the nation acknowledge the merits of progressive ideals. Those events include a destructive pandemic that has now claimed close to half a million lives, a debilitating economic crisis that hit low-income people and essential workers the hardest, and racial justice protests that galvanized millions against the brutal police killings of Black Americans.\n\nThe federal government distributed stimulus checks as respite, but it quickly became clear that one-time payments wouldn't be enough. Longer-term investments in working Americans and those who've been hit hardest by systemic inequalities would be necessary to ensure stability.\n\nActivists, along with a handful of progressive lawmakers, have been organizing for such bold action - increased minimum wage, Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal, tuition-free public college, paid family leave - with slow gains. But the caucus advocating for these reforms has only grown bigger.\n\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus, now made up of almost 100 members , is not interested in compromising its values and playing it safe. As caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) wrote in January, \"It's clear that too many people no longer believe that government has done enough to help lift all boats. ... The solution to this is clear: a progressive agenda that makes a transformative difference in people's lives. Biden's platform was the most progressive of any recent nominee because our movement worked with his campaign to push forward bold policies.\"\n\nExactly how many progressive priorities can pass this term is still an open question. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has previously said that key agenda items include Covid-19 relief, a green infrastructure bill, and voting rights legislation - all of which could well be shaped heavily by progressive demands.\n\n\"'The Squad' is growing, as is the Congressional Progressive Caucus,\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) told Vox. \"But the Squad is not just a few members of Congress. It's the millions of people across the country who want to see transformative change and are with us in spirit in the halls of Congress.\"\n\nVox spoke to eight new progressive Congress members - from Cori Bush, who was a registered nurse and activist in Ferguson, to Kai Kahele, a former military pilot and educator - about how they intend to prioritize racial justice and plan to wield their power as a bloc to move these ideas forward. Their ambitious proposals would address racial disparities across several areas, including education, banking, and policing. Their remarks have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent my life serving children in communities that have been harmed and marginalized by policy. I've seen their brilliance go unnoticed and unnurtured. I look forward to introducing holistic education with an unapologetic racial justice lens - legislation that is intersectional and centers children's holistic needs in ways that haven't been done before. We will work to undo that harm but also expose the majestic brilliance in each child.\n\nAs it stands, America is failing many of our students in public schooling. In 2016, majority-minority school districts received $23 billion less in funding than their majority-white counterparts. That's a two-tiered system of educational apartheid, which works to uphold white supremacy. I've seen firsthand how denial of educational resources can stunt a child's curiosity [and] growth and prevent them from reaching their full potential.\n\nWe need to replace standardized testing and punishment with nurturing and care. That starts with paying a living wage to our public school teachers so that teachers from all socioeconomic backgrounds can pursue the profession, allowing Black and brown kids to have instructors who they see themselves in. We also must fund full-time nurses and social workers, not cops, in our schools, and give them resources to care for children rather than criminalizing them from a young age. We need to invest at least $3 billion into opening at least 25,000 community schools to make educational equity a reality.\n\n\" The Squad \" is growing, as is the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But the Squad is not just a few members of Congress. It's the millions of people across the country who want to see transformative change and are with us in spirit in the halls of Congress. This can be a new Reconstruction moment for our country, and we'll use every tool available to make that happen.\n\nEverything I do is through a racial justice lens. In the 117th Congress, we have a mandate to legislate in defense of Black lives. I am eager to end systemic police violence that disproportionately kills Black and brown people across St. Louis and communities across our country. I believe we need to shift funding away from policing and reinvest in the people and communities who need it most. For me, that starts with redirecting policing budgets to fund schools, housing, and health care.\n\nWe are at the intersection of the most devastating pandemic in over a century, an economic crisis that has millions at risk of eviction, and a racial justice reckoning. We have to meet this moment with bold ideas that will make it so entire communities aren't lost or devastated as a result of inaccessible health care or unaffordable housing. We need to prioritize those among us who have the least: the uninsured, unhoused, undocumented, incarcerated, and those who are unable to have their material needs met.\n\nWe need to guarantee basic dignity. Let's start by giving $2,000 monthly and retroactive survival checks to everyone. Let's start by ensuring that people aren't removed from their homes because they've been out of work and can't afford back rent or mortgages. People need direct cash relief, and as a progressive movement, we're united in the fight to ensure everyone has the resources they need to make it through this crisis.\n\nMy greatest passion is public housing. I would not be where I am today were it not for public housing and the stability it gave me and my family. The New York City Housing Authority, which manages public housing in New York City, houses a population larger than that of most large cities - about half a million New Yorkers. And how I think about it is, if NYCHA were a city unto itself, it would be the largest city of low-income Black and brown Americans in the United States.\n\nThe neglect of public housing has been ground zero for systemic racism, and the federal government has systematically starved NYCHA of federal funding of about $40 billion in cash. There are children who have been poisoned by lead because of the federal government, or senior citizens who have been left freezing in their homes during the bitter cold of winter because of the federal government.\n\nI'm on a mission to ensure that public housing gets its fair share of federal funding; the federal government should be required by law to fully fund public housing. It should no longer be subject to the annual appropriation because housing is so fundamental.\n\nI'm deeply committed to the vision of housing as a human right. The best tool for making housing not only a human right, but also a universal reality, is what I call housing vouchers for all. Every person in need should have access to a Section 8 voucher, which would guarantee that they pay no more than 30 percent of their household income toward rent.\n\nPresident Biden's executive order on fair housing is a starting point, but it's hardly enough. Systemic racism has been a reality in America for 400 years, since the beginning of slavery. And in those 400 years, we are as close as we've ever been to confronting the root causes of systemic racism. We're much more conscious of race, and we're much more committed to centering racial equity. The president is striking the right tone, but the executive order he issued on racial equity should only be the beginning.\n\nThis next generation of elected officials is more disruptive and willing to speak out when necessary - \"good trouble,\" in the words of John Lewis. A Democratic presidency, a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House represent the makings of an FDR moment over the next few years. We owe it to the American people to make the most of it, or else shame on us.\n\nWe must expand the size of the Supreme Court and look at Court expansion as a racial justice issue. This would unrig our democracy and ensure that all of the legislation that the democratically controlled House and Senate, and the president, enact will be upheld and constitutional.\n\nThere is a 6-3 hyperpartisan conservative majority on the Supreme Court that is hostile to democracy itself, and we would be foolish to think that this 6-3 majority is somehow neutral in its deliberations of cases challenging statutes that Congress has enacted.\n\nCourt expansion is a racial justice issue, when you look at how the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in the 2013 Shelby decision . It's also an issue of reproductive freedom, when you look at how this Court now has a majority that does not believe in a woman's right to choose. And, of course, court expansion is an issue of LGBTQ+ rights and justice.\n\nWe must take a holistic view of systemic racism that is not just rooted in policing reform. Obviously, we're in this moment of unprecedented recognition of racism in policing in this country. However, systemic racism extends even beyond reforming our criminal legal system to include the way that we fund public education in this country, for example. We must have a broad conception of systemic racism, and we must tackle systemic racism on all fronts, not just on the ones that popularly come to mind.\n\nA huge intersection of racial inequity and income inequity is the access to capital, and that almost a third of our nation is underbanked or unbanked. And so I'm very excited about postal and public banking - to make sure that people have a place where they can create their own wealth and have it be sustainable.\n\nWe know Black and brown communities are disproportionately affected by being underbanked or unbanked. The Covid-19 pandemic and the distribution of stimulus relief have highlighted these gross inequities.\n\nAmericans with bank accounts receive stimulus funds electronically, with the money available in mere seconds. And those businesses who have relationships with major financial institutions receive access to business assistance loans first. However, the underbanked and unbanked wait for weeks - months, in some cases - to receive assistance, forcing many Americans and small businesses into desperate situations.\n\nLegislation on postal banking would establish the USPS to provide basic checking, savings, bill payment, and short-term credit solutions to working people and small businesses, further ensuring that relief passed by Congress in the future is delivered quickly to the American people who are relying on it the most to survive.\n\nI'm currently working with colleagues in the House and Senate who have previously worked on legislation regarding postal banking, as part of a collaborative effort to build on past progress and further ensure financial inclusion for unbanked and underbanked Americans as we work toward an equitable economic recovery.\n\nSolving racial inequity is not a silo. It's not a section or a place. Racism is a part of every minute of every hour of every day. So we have to embed policy that addresses the issue, in every minute of every hour of every day, in every single policy we do.\n\nI am excited to advocate to strengthen and diversify support of Indigenous children. Although I am still working on the details of what this advocacy will look like in practical policy, I'm interested in 1) building incentives for Indigenous-based early learning options, including dual language programs and classrooms focused on Indigenous culture; 2) encouraging more Native students to pursue fields where we are historically underrepresented, especially in decision-making positions, by supporting debt-free college and ensuring that schools with high populations of Indigenous children are given the tools necessary to apply and succeed in college; and 3) supporting policy and federal funding which will further assist in the revitalization of Indigenous languages in the United States.\n\nRacial justice and true equity require complex, varied policy approaches. I believe that our nation needs to heal, and that we can only do that by confronting the way our history is intertwined with racism and colonialism. As a Native Hawaiian, I'm particularly interested in advocating for multifaceted legislation that will target increased supports for Native people, including empowering Native peoples' role in the economy, improving education opportunities and outcomes, and addressing the disproportionate impact of the criminal justice and carceral systems on people of color.\n\nI believe that we must make strides for all people impacted by the racism that pervades our society. I'm especially interested in making sure any policymaking we develop considers and addresses Indigenous and Pacific Islander communities.\n\nI intend to tackle climate change, and focus on what we need to do here in New Mexico, like regulating methane emissions and building out a green energy grid. Focusing on a local problem contributes to solving a planetary crisis.\n\nWe must not treat those communities, whether they be coal-, oil-, and gas-producing [communities] that fueled America's rise, as sacrifice zones. I am working on legislation to ensure the people of New Mexico - especially our Native American, Latino, and rural communities - have a prominent role in our clean energy economy.\n\nThis means promoting clean energy development on our public lands and working with tribal nations to ensure they have the tools and resources necessary to deploy clean energy. Not only should we promote clean energy, but we need to support transmission - or what I like to call a Route 66 - of solar and wind to power other parts of the country.\n\nIt's critical that we take advantage of the economic opportunity that clean energy presents, and it's on us to ensure that we don't leave behind the people and communities that fueled our nation.\n\nOne example is legislation I intend to lead on that addresses the environmental legacy of oil and gas operations and regulates methane emissions from ongoing oil and gas development. We can put New Mexicans back to work plugging the more than 700 orphaned oil and gas wells in the state, or installing equipment at oil and gas sites to curb venting, leaks, and other sources of methane emissions.\n\nThese projects would provide employment opportunities for current or former oil and gas industry workers, while delivering cleaner air and water for communities across New Mexico.\n\nWe should place a racial and equitable justice lens on every bill we put forward.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nFrom reforming police funding to setting up postal banking, these progressives say racial justice is at the core of their work.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas and Li Zhou\n\nJust one year ago, America was not ready to consider the possibilities of bold racial justice reform. Discussion of reparations, a system that would redress the country's oldest sin of slavery, or universal basic income, a guarantee of economic security, were just talking points on the campaign trail for candidates vying to be president.\n\nIt would take the acutely distressing events of the following months to help the nation acknowledge the merits of progressive ideals. Those events include a destructive pandemic that has now claimed close to half a million lives, a debilitating economic crisis that hit low-income people and essential workers the hardest, and racial justice protests that galvanized millions against the brutal police killings of Black Americans.\n\nThe federal government distributed stimulus checks as respite, but it quickly became clear that one-time payments wouldn't be enough. Longer-term investments in working Americans and those who've been hit hardest by systemic inequalities would be necessary to ensure stability.\n\nActivists, along with a handful of progressive lawmakers, have been organizing for such bold action - increased minimum wage, Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal, tuition-free public college, paid family leave - with slow gains. But the caucus advocating for these reforms has only grown bigger.\n\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus, now made up of almost 100 members , is not interested in compromising its values and playing it safe. As caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) wrote in January, \"It's clear that too many people no longer believe that government has done enough to help lift all boats. ... The solution to this is clear: a progressive agenda that makes a transformative difference in people's lives. Biden's platform was the most progressive of any recent nominee because our movement worked with his campaign to push forward bold policies.\"\n\nExactly how many progressive priorities can pass this term is still an open question. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has previously said that key agenda items include Covid-19 relief, a green infrastructure bill, and voting rights legislation - all of which could well be shaped heavily by progressive demands.\n\n\"'The Squad' is growing, as is the Congressional Progressive Caucus,\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) told Vox. \"But the Squad is not just a few members of Congress. It's the millions of people across the country who want to see transformative change and are with us in spirit in the halls of Congress.\"\n\nVox spoke to eight new progressive Congress members - from Cori Bush, who was a registered nurse and activist in Ferguson, to Kai Kahele, a former military pilot and educator - about how they intend to prioritize racial justice and plan to wield their power as a bloc to move these ideas forward. Their ambitious proposals would address racial disparities across several areas, including education, banking, and policing. Their remarks have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent my life serving children in communities that have been harmed and marginalized by policy. I've seen their brilliance go unnoticed and unnurtured. I look forward to introducing holistic education with an unapologetic racial justice lens - legislation that is intersectional and centers children's holistic needs in ways that haven't been done before. We will work to undo that harm but also expose the majestic brilliance in each child.\n\nAs it stands, America is failing many of our students in public schooling. In 2016, majority-minority school districts received $23 billion less in funding than their majority-white counterparts. That's a two-tiered system of educational apartheid, which works to uphold white supremacy. I've seen firsthand how denial of educational resources can stunt a child's curiosity [and] growth and prevent them from reaching their full potential.\n\nWe need to replace standardized testing and punishment with nurturing and care. That starts with paying a living wage to our public school teachers so that teachers from all socioeconomic backgrounds can pursue the profession, allowing Black and brown kids to have instructors who they see themselves in. We also must fund full-time nurses and social workers, not cops, in our schools, and give them resources to care for children rather than criminalizing them from a young age. We need to invest at least $3 billion into opening at least 25,000 community schools to make educational equity a reality.\n\n\" The Squad \" is growing, as is the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But the Squad is not just a few members of Congress. It's the millions of people across the country who want to see transformative change and are with us in spirit in the halls of Congress. This can be a new Reconstruction moment for our country, and we'll use every tool available to make that happen.\n\nEverything I do is through a racial justice lens. In the 117th Congress, we have a mandate to legislate in defense of Black lives. I am eager to end systemic police violence that disproportionately kills Black and brown people across St. Louis and communities across our country. I believe we need to shift funding away from policing and reinvest in the people and communities who need it most. For me, that starts with redirecting policing budgets to fund schools, housing, and health care.\n\nWe are at the intersection of the most devastating pandemic in over a century, an economic crisis that has millions at risk of eviction, and a racial justice reckoning. We have to meet this moment with bold ideas that will make it so entire communities aren't lost or devastated as a result of inaccessible health care or unaffordable housing. We need to prioritize those among us who have the least: the uninsured, unhoused, undocumented, incarcerated, and those who are unable to have their material needs met.\n\nWe need to guarantee basic dignity. Let's start by giving $2,000 monthly and retroactive survival checks to everyone. Let's start by ensuring that people aren't removed from their homes because they've been out of work and can't afford back rent or mortgages. People need direct cash relief, and as a progressive movement, we're united in the fight to ensure everyone has the resources they need to make it through this crisis.\n\nMy greatest passion is public housing. I would not be where I am today were it not for public housing and the stability it gave me and my family. The New York City Housing Authority, which manages public housing in New York City, houses a population larger than that of most large cities - about half a million New Yorkers. And how I think about it is, if NYCHA were a city unto itself, it would be the largest city of low-income Black and brown Americans in the United States.\n\nThe neglect of public housing has been ground zero for systemic racism, and the federal government has systematically starved NYCHA of federal funding of about $40 billion in cash. There are children who have been poisoned by lead because of the federal government, or senior citizens who have been left freezing in their homes during the bitter cold of winter because of the federal government.\n\nI'm on a mission to ensure that public housing gets its fair share of federal funding; the federal government should be required by law to fully fund public housing. It should no longer be subject to the annual appropriation because housing is so fundamental.\n\nI'm deeply committed to the vision of housing as a human right. The best tool for making housing not only a human right, but also a universal reality, is what I call housing vouchers for all. Every person in need should have access to a Section 8 voucher, which would guarantee that they pay no more than 30 percent of their household income toward rent.\n\nPresident Biden's executive order on fair housing is a starting point, but it's hardly enough. Systemic racism has been a reality in America for 400 years, since the beginning of slavery. And in those 400 years, we are as close as we've ever been to confronting the root causes of systemic racism. We're much more conscious of race, and we're much more committed to centering racial equity. The president is striking the right tone, but the executive order he issued on racial equity should only be the beginning.\n\nThis next generation of elected officials is more disruptive and willing to speak out when necessary - \"good trouble,\" in the words of John Lewis. A Democratic presidency, a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House represent the makings of an FDR moment over the next few years. We owe it to the American people to make the most of it, or else shame on us.\n\nWe must expand the size of the Supreme Court and look at Court expansion as a racial justice issue. This would unrig our democracy and ensure that all of the legislation that the democratically controlled House and Senate, and the president, enact will be upheld and constitutional.\n\nThere is a 6-3 hyperpartisan conservative majority on the Supreme Court that is hostile to democracy itself, and we would be foolish to think that this 6-3 majority is somehow neutral in its deliberations of cases challenging statutes that Congress has enacted.\n\nCourt expansion is a racial justice issue, when you look at how the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in the 2013 Shelby decision . It's also an issue of reproductive freedom, when you look at how this Court now has a majority that does not believe in a woman's right to choose. And, of course, court expansion is an issue of LGBTQ+ rights and justice.\n\nWe must take a holistic view of systemic racism that is not just rooted in policing reform. Obviously, we're in this moment of unprecedented recognition of racism in policing in this country. However, systemic racism extends even beyond reforming our criminal legal system to include the way that we fund public education in this country, for example. We must have a broad conception of systemic racism, and we must tackle systemic racism on all fronts, not just on the ones that popularly come to mind.\n\nA huge intersection of racial inequity and income inequity is the access to capital, and that almost a third of our nation is underbanked or unbanked. And so I'm very excited about postal and public banking - to make sure that people have a place where they can create their own wealth and have it be sustainable.\n\nWe know Black and brown communities are disproportionately affected by being underbanked or unbanked.

I believe that our nation needs to heal, and that we can only do that by confronting the way our history is intertwined with racism and colonialism.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBush defeated a 10-term Democratic incumbent in a primary earlier this year.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nCori Bush, a rising progressive star in the Democratic Party, handily won a first term in the US House of Representatives on Election Day.\n\nThe Black progressive previously defeated a 10-term incumbent Democrat, Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., in this year's primary for Missouri's First District, which covers the Democratic stronghold of St. Louis. Insofar as Bush won an election as a Democrat in St. Louis, that's not too surprising. But as Aaron Ross Coleman wrote for Vox at the time , Bush's victory in the primary was a surprising upset - one spurred by her strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement:\n\nBush, a 44-year-old single mother, nurse, and leader in the 2014 Ferguson uprising , ousted 64-year-old, 10-term incumbent Clay in the St. Louis-area district. The bout was a rematch of the 2018 race, which Clay won by a 20-point margin. Both candidates are Black. However, Bush's candidacy this time spoke to the moment, with her connections to a movement sweeping the nation following the killing of George Floyd and the sustained protests since the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, a city in the district.\n\nClay, on the other hand, was criticized by activists who claimed he hadn't heavily participated in Black Lives Matter protests, and that he'd rejected calls to \"defund the police.\"\n\nBut, Coleman added, Bush made gains in other areas too, representing \"an anti-corporate insurgency that has been brewing in the Democratic Party more broadly.\" Clay could argue he's a progressive given his support of Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal, but he also took campaign donations from some controversial sources, including big banks.\n\nBush's victory falls within the broader context of Black progressives winning big races in the House. As Ella Nilsen wrote for Vox :\n\nA new group of Black progressives has officially been elected to Congress.\n\nIt's been a year defined in part by nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, unabashedly progressive Black candidates ran in - and won - races around the country. It's another step toward meaningful representation for Black and brown constituents.\n\n\"We need more people in Congress for whom policy is personal. I was the only candidate talking about racial justice before the events of the past several weeks,\" presumptive member of Congress Mondaire Jones (D-NY) told Vox this summer. \"I'm grateful more people now are seeing it.\"\n\nThis kind of broad representation matters. Bush, as a single member of the House, may not be able to do much on her own. But with these crucial progressive allies backing her in the legislature, perhaps her vision for America will have a better chance of being reflected in bills next year.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump told NBC that making the pardons would be one of his day-one priorities.\n\nThe case for and against fracking, politics aside.\n\nIdentity is complicated, and she shouldn't have to choose just one.\n\nThe former president was charged with 13 counts in Georgia.\n\nIt's the fourth time that Trump has been indicted.\n\nYour biggest questions about the federal criminal charges against Trump in the January 6 case, answered.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe far right is dangerously obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow left-wing members of Congress. They deserve the Left's solidarity.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks as Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) listen during a news conference at the US Capitol on July 15, 2019 in Washington, DC.  (Alex Wroblewski / Getty)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt's never reassuring to begin the New Year with a right-wing insurrection against an elected government. Much was disturbing about the January 6 Capitol riot, including the possibility of more antidemocratic, white supremacist mayhem yet to come. But especially terrifying were the threats on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's life, and the news that the democratic socialist congresswoman may have come close to assassination.\n\nDescribing the events of January 6, AOC said on Instagram, \"I can tell you that I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.\" She said that she couldn't say much more about it for security reasons, but elaborated, \"I did not know whether I was going to make it to the end of that day alive. Not just in a general sense, but in a very, very specific sense.\"\n\nThe far right has been obsessed with AOC since her election in 2018. Its scary fixation on her reflects its terror of women and people of color holding power, of course, but these hard-rightists are also - as fascists always have been - deeply triggered by socialism.\n\nA man from Texas was arrested after participating in the riots and calling for AOC's assassination online. He now faces five federal charges. It's good that the government is taking action against these dangerous criminals. But the more powerful actors freely walking into the Capitol every day may be even more dangerous. AOC said on Instagram that she did not feel safe in the place other members of Congress were hiding during the January 6 riot, because some of them were white supremacists and QAnon sympathizers, she said, \"who I have felt would disclose my location and would create opportunities for me to be hurt, kidnapped, etc.\" AOC rightly skipped Biden's inauguration, both to join the picket line of striking workers in the Bronx , and also, she said, to avoid the security risk of being near those colleagues.\n\nThe rest of the Squad appear to be in danger, too. Cori Bush has just moved her office, \"for my team's safety,\" she said, after harassment from Marjorie Taylor Greene, an openly anti-Semitic white nationalist congresswoman who has called for the assassination of Nancy Pelosi and other colleagues, referred to January 6 as a \"1776 moment,\" and has called Cori Bush a \"Black Lives Matter terrorist.\" On January 6, Ilhan Omar was evacuated to a secure location otherwise reserved for senior congressional leadership - because, she has said, law enforcement believed her life was at special risk. Since her election to Congress, Trump has incited threats against Omar, and in the months leading up to the November election, those threats increased. During the riot, Ayanna Pressley's staff found that the panic buttons in their offices had been torn out. Rashida Tlaib has received constant death threats throughout her time in office.\n\nThere is a psychosexual edge to the Right's obsession with AOC. Eroticizing what they hate, rightists circulate memes on the internet depicting AOC as a tyrannical dominatrix, in full BDSM leather gear, crushing white men under her sharp boots. In one of them, Jeff Bezos kneels at her feet, handing over money, in a financial domination scenario (\"findom\" is an extremely niche kink in which submissives, usually men, enjoy giving up money, usually to women). The idea of socialism as totalitarianism - specifically, a dictatorship in which rich white men are forcibly expropriated by powerful women of color - looms large in the right-wing imaginary. (Literally \"large\" - in many of these memes, AOC, physically a small, slight woman, is a giant, looming alarmingly over the white men she tyrannizes.) AOC is at the center of this fantasy. It would be harmless as a bit of edgy pornography, but in this political climate, the fantasy can easily turn deadly.\n\nWhile racism and patriarchy are fundamental to fascist thinking, the fascist obsession with socialism is just as central. Every far-right movement in history has viewed socialism as its key adversary, and this one is no exception. For Hitler and the Nazis, racial enemies were inseparable from socialism, and contemporary far-rightists think the same way. Today, the right-wing hatred of socialism, personified by a woman of color, is a global phenomenon. In 2018, the same year that AOC was elected to Congress, right-wing Jair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil, and Marielle Franco, a black socialist city council member in Rio, and an outspoken activist against police brutality, was assassinated. A year later, two former police officers connected to a paramilitary group were arrested and charged with her murder. Both suspects had ties to Bolsonaro.\n\nAssuming a childishly anarchistic posture toward government, some on the left have imagined that the January 6 rioters' complaints about Democrats mirror their own. Jimmy Dore, for example, doubted that the riots would have happened if Americans had their two-thousand-dollar checks. This is a perilous misreading. In addition to the explicit dangers to the Squad, there were numerous threats on Nancy Pelosi's life that day, including calls to hang her or put a bullet through her head. That's not because Pelosi has failed to write relief checks or support Medicare for All - exactly the opposite. It's because the Right sees Pelosi as socialist.\n\nThat idea isn't limited to fringe weirdos - even Lindsey Graham tweeted in November that Pelosi and the Democratic mainstream support socialism \"deep in their soul.\" At last summer's GOP convention, the main message from speaker after speaker was that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were socialists. On the loonier right, this opinion is expressed only slightly more floridly: Representative Mo Brooks referred to the January 6 rioters as patriots \"fighting back against anti-Christian socialists.\" The Right has often seen socialist phantasms lurking in the mainstream; historian Richard Hofstadter quoted a right-wing woman in the 1950s sighing, upon the reelection of Dwight Eisenhower, \"Four more years of socialism.\"\n\nThere is zero affinity between right-wing and left-wing grievances. If you're a socialist, far-rightists share none of your political goals and viciously oppose every ideal you take seriously. They also want you dead. That's as good a definition of a political enemy as I can imagine.\n\nOf course, individuals caught up in right-wing movements can and do change their minds. Your QAnon-obsessed neighbor probably isn't violent and you should try to convince her of the error of her ways - and even why she should be a socialist instead (The New York Times recently reported on a Bernie supporter who, disillusioned with Democrats after the Vermont socialist's 2016 loss, had turned to QAnon. We can certainly reach people like that). But as an organized movement, there's nothing harmless or politically laudable about the forces behind the January 6 mob. This movement doesn't just hate socialism; its hatred of socialism is at the core of its politics. The more it grows and mobilizes, the more violently it will fight any socialists who get close to power.\n\nSome have suggested that AOC was being overly dramatic in candidly describing the risks she faced that day and continues to face. That's dangerously wrong. The Squad has rightly opposed expanding the federal government's legal tools for combatting domestic terrorism. The government's existing mechanisms are entirely adequate, and to add more would likely lead to restrictions on the civil liberties of the Left and of racial minorities. But the Left needs to take the threats directed at our elected democratic socialist leaders seriously. We must demand adequate security for AOC and the rest of the Squad and a full investigation and prosecution of anyone who endangers their lives. We must also defeat this depraved movement through organizing, persuasion, social pressure, and, when needed, force, including law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, AOC and her fellow Squad members are putting their lives on the line every day fighting for democratic socialism and progressive values. They deserve all our solidarity.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nWesley Bell, who's challenging Cori Bush in Missouri, dropped out of a race against Republican Josh Hawley to take on the Democratic congresswoman. Apparently, punching left with AIPAC's support is a more appealing career booster than challenging the Right.\n\nRep. Cori Bush on Capitol Hill on March 12, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn 2006, Wesley Bell attended a $2,000-per-ticket event welcoming President George W. Bush to St Louis, Missouri. At the time, Bell was managing the campaign of Mark Byrne, a conservative Republican running for the MO-01 congressional seat on promises to oppose abortion and gun control. Byrne lost to Democrat Lacy Clay.\n\nIn 2014, Bell changed course and marched in the Ferguson protests after the police murder of Michael Brown. Most believe Bell's political career began with this involvement in the Black Lives Matter movement, and Bell is relying on this reputation in his current campaign against progressive Democratic congresswoman Cori Bush. But his history and his allegiances deserve far more scrutiny.\n\nIn 2018, riding the wave of Black Lives Matter, Bell ran for St Louis County Prosecutor as a progressive Democrat. He channeled the intense desire for a change in Missouri's draconian criminal justice system and won, taking the political establishment by surprise. Bell's predecessor, Bob McCulloch, had failed to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who killed Michael Brown over petty shoplifting. Bell promised he would bring charges against Wilson. But in August 2020, he changed his mind and decided not to.\n\n\"It was a betrayal,\" said Justin Hansford, a St Louis activist and director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University, in an interview with the Intercept . \"There were a lot of people who spent a lot of time and energy supporting Bell specifically because they expected him to at the very least reopen the case and let the family have their day in court, so that the facts could be put forth in a trial, and so that everyone could see them. It would have given us a sense of transparency.\"\n\nStill, Bell's profile rose in the Missouri Democratic Party, and in early 2024, he announced a run for Senate against Josh Hawley, a self-declared Christian Nationalist . The Ferguson protests featured prominently in Bell's early campaign material. \"Ferguson made me realize there was more I could do,\" Bell said. Bell argued that Hawley's agitational behavior during the January 6 protests stoked the fires of unrest. \"When I faced chaos in Ferguson, I worked to calm tensions,\" Bell said. \"But when Josh Hawley was faced with chaos, he chose to inflame it.\" Hawley's January 6 behavior was beginning to prove a major liability, with one wealthy and well-connected donor admitting that supporting Hawley's rise \"was the worst mistake I ever made in my life,\" making him feel something akin to \"what Dr Frankenstein must have felt.\"\n\nBut rather than build his campaign against Hawley, Bell dramatically shifted his priorities, pivoting to mount a challenge against a left-wing Missouri politician instead. Last June, Bell called Cori Bush to promise he wouldn't run against her. Then, after the Hamas attack in Israel on October 7 and the outbreak of Israel's assault on Gaza, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) \"let it be publicly known that a challenger to Bush would have effectively bottomless fundraising support,\" writes Ryan Grim. Bell subsequently dropped out of his race against Hawley and turned around to challenge Bush. This opened the floodgates for the Israel lobby, which has spent a staggering $7 million on Bell's run to capture Bush's seat.\n\nAs of July 2024, AIPAC's massive donations only account for 62 percent of Bell's contributions - in part because Missouri Republicans have lavished Bell's coffers. The Huffington Post reported that Bell's campaign filings included donations \"from notable sources such as Steven Tilley, a GOP former Missouri House speaker who's now a lobbyist,\" and \"Daniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Third Point, who has donated millions to Republican causes.\"\n\nWorld Wide Technology's David Steward, a conservative tech billionaire from St Louis, also supports Bell. \"Steward recently served as the finance chair of a super PAC that supported Sen. Tim Scott's (R-SC) run for president,\" the Huffington Post reported. \"All told, Bell raised more than $65,000 from donors who also gave to one of Missouri's two Republican senators, Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, in their most recent campaigns, or Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, the leading Republican candidate for governor.\"\n\nBell had gone from opposing Hawley to raking in donations from the same people supporting his former opponent. Rather than try to turn a red seat blue, Bell apparently felt his political career was better served by a well-funded challenge against a fellow Democrat in a safe blue seat.\n\nBefore 2014, Cori Bush was employed as a nurse. She ran on a platform advocating \"black maternal health, abortion rights and diverting money from law enforcement to public services,\" all issues integral to the lives of working-class black women like herself. Bush's priorities also include passing the pro-union PRO Act, expanding Medicare until it's Medicare for All, passing the Green New Deal, and raising the minimum wage to $25 an hour.\n\nIn 2023, Bush secured millions of dollars in emergency funding after catastrophic flooding ravaged St Louis. Her office is now focused on preparing St Louisans for the future, which promises more extreme weather that will compound the manifold environmental issues facing Missouri and hit working-class people hardest.\n\nEnvironmental justice is a key issue for Bush, who is also attempting a major nuclear waste removal from schools and residential backyards. Contaminated by Mallinckrodt-refined uranium during the Manhattan Project, the price tag for the cleanup of Coldwater Creek is over $400 million , totaling $2.6 billion in environmental liabilities that only grow year after year as the contamination seeps and spreads around in flooding. Due to the cost, politicians have been disinclined to touch the cleanup project, and residents have paid a steep price. The zip codes that Cold Water travels through in north St Louis County have elevated levels of cancer. \"Every man on my block died of stomach or intestinal cancer,\" said Representative Doug Clemens of St Ann. Bush is pursuing legislation that will clean up the contamination.\n\nBush's advocacy for increased public investment to improve conditions for working-class St Louisans has won her few friends in elite corridors. But it's her position on Gaza that has made her the target of right-wing spending in this race. The congresswoman was one of the first to file legislation calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. She has also shown stalwart support for activists in her home district.\n\nMO-01 is home to large assembly facilities for the Boeing Cooperation , with many military-industrial contractors scattered throughout. On April 15, pro-Palestine activists blocked the gates of the Boeing manufacturing plant in St Charles, Missouri. Boeing manufactures military weapons from drones to missiles to jets, many of which are used by the Israel Defense Forces in its assault on Gaza.\n\nThe following month, another round of protests occurred in St Louis, also related to Boeing. In May, Washington University students formed a Palestinian solidarity encampment. Protesters pointed to the university's connections with Boeing and demanded disinvestment. In response, the university declared the encampment illegal and deployed police to aggressively arrest the protesters. \"There were brutalizing assaults,\" sophomore León-Díaz said. \"It was jarring to see my friends being treated like empty sacks of organs, entirely dehumanized, with no respect for their dignity.\" Over one hundred students, teachers, and activists were cuffed.\n\nBush aligned herself with the protesters, saying, \"Solidarity with antiwar student activists at WashU.\" Megan Green, president of the St Louis Board of Aldermen, told Jacobin :\n\nCongresswoman Bush organized a call with all the students and impacted faculty in the days after the brutality to hear their stories and how Washington University's heavy-handed response impacted them. She immediately contacted the university to attempt to open up a dialogue between the administration and students.\n\nIt is this activity that has opened up Bush's race to a flood of donations from AIPAC and right-wing pro-Israel donors.\n\nDrive through the district's rich white neighborhoods like Webster and the Central West End, and you will see many Wesley Bell yard signs - some with pro-Israel signs as well. But in MO-01, the white enclaves are a minority. Bush's strongest districts are in the predominantly black neighborhoods in North St Louis. She is most popular among those living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIt's unclear if Bell's spending will sway those voters. In any case, there is no organic call for a tack to the center in MO-01. As Green told Jacobin , \"We currently have alignment in our city politics between local and congressional representation. Bell winning threatens to disrupt that collaboration and uniform vision. Cori fights with us and having that type of leadership is essential to creating a St Louis that thrives.\"\n\nBush's seat is a valuable one for the Democratic Party because it's so secure - a rare position inside a heavily gerrymandered red state where left values have a loud voice. The urban blue islands of Missouri are the state's only counterbalance to uniform Republican rule.\n\nIn this environment, Bell is trying hard to shore up his progressive bona fides. But in one telling twist, a campaign ad depicting him speaking at a Ferguson rally in 2014 shows Bush, too, standing behind him in the crowd. This snapshot hints at the central difference between Bush and Bell. Do the core values of the Black Lives Matter movement, which was born in St Louis, stop at the perimeter of the United States? Bell believes those values do not apply to Gazans. Bush believes they do.\n\nThese are the higher-level, more theoretical stakes of the race. But while Israel plays a major role in determining the allocation of money, on the ground, the election is about resource allocation.\n\nBell's message is that he is every bit as progressive as Bush, but is also - at the same time and without conflict - friendlier to corporations and big business. Older, richer people in St Louis believe they'll get something out of Bell that Bush isn't offering. If they turn out in larger numbers, Bell will win. But if younger, more progressive people of color turn out, Bush will win. The vote is on August 6.\n\nDevin Thomas O'Shea's writing has appeared in the Nation , Protean , Current Affairs , Boulevard , and elsewhere.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush under investigation by Justice Department over security spending\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  January 30, 2024 / 2:31 PM EST / CBS News\n\nWashington - The Justice Department is investigating Democratic Rep. Cori Bush over the potential misuse of funds for her personal security services, the Missouri Democrat confirmed Tuesday.\n\nIn a lengthy statement issued after news of the federal probe emerged, Bush said she and her team are \"fully cooperating in this investigation.\"\n\n\"First and foremost, I hold myself, my campaign, and my position to the highest levels of integrity. I also believe in transparency which is why I can confirm that the Department of Justice is reviewing my campaign's spending on security services,\" Bush said.\n\nThe House sergeant at arms recently received a subpoena from the Justice Department seeking records related to Bush's use of security funds, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.\n\nThe existence of the federal investigation was first reported by Punchbowl News . The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nBush joined Congress in 2021 after working as an activist, nurse and pastor. She is a member of the small but influential group of House progressives known as \"the squad.\"\n\nIn her statement, Bush said she has faced \"relentless threats to my physical safety and life\" since taking office. Since she does not receive taxpayer-funded personal security, she has used campaign funds \"as permissible to retain security services.\" She wrote that she has \"not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services.\"\n\nShe also acknowledged that she \"retained my husband as part of my security team to provide security services,\" saying he \"has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate.\"\n\nBush said her security spending is also being reviewed by the Federal Election Commission and House Ethics Committee. She noted that the Office of Congressional Ethics looked into the matter last year. The office, she said, \"found no wrongdoing and voted unanimously to dismiss the case.\"\n\nBush, who has pushed the \"defund the police\" agenda, defended her spending on private security in an August 2021 interview with CBS News. CBS News correspondent and anchor Vladimir Duthiers asked Bush to respond to critics who say it's \"hypocritical\" that she spent $70,000 on private security while continuing to push for reforms to funding for police departments.\n\n\"They would rather I die? You would rather me die? Is that what you want to see?\" Bush responded at the time. \"You want to see me die? You know, because that could be the alternative. So either I spent $70,000 on private security over the last few months, and I'm here standing now and able to speak, able to help save 11 million people from being evicted. Or - I could possibly have a death attempt on my life. And we're also talking about the same exact people who say horrible things about me, who lie to build up their base. And then because they lie about me, I receive death threats.\"\n\nEd O'Keefe, Nikole Killion and Robert Legare contributed reporting.\n\nMichael Kaplan is an award-winning reporter and producer for the CBS News investigative unit. He specializes in securing scoops and crafting long-form television investigations. His work has appeared on \"60 Minutes,\" CNN and in The New York Times.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush, member of \"The Squad,\" projected to lose Democratic primary to challenger Wesley Bell\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  August 7, 2024 / 9:16 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nDemocratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri lost her reelection bid Tuesday to primary challenger Wesley Bell, a St. Louis County prosecutor, the Associated Press projected, becoming the second member of the progressive congressional group known as \" The Squad \" to lose her seat.\n\nWhen Bush was elected in 2020, she became the first Black woman to represent Missouri, the first nurse and the first organizer from the Black Lives Matter movement in Congress. The primary race in Missouri's 1st Congressional District between Bush and Bell was the second most expensive House primary in 2024.\n\n\"My community knows who I am,\" Bush previously told CBS News. \"This district has seen me for the last 10 years going from the activist to the 'politivist,' which is what I call myself. They know that about me. They know that I am going to fight for the people in the streets.\"\n\nBush rose to national prominence after defeating longtime incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in 2020. She cruised to victory in 2022 but the two-term congresswoman faced her toughest political fight yet against Bell.\n\n\"The congresswoman is not doing her job,\" Bell said in an interview with CBS News. \"She is not working with others, and it's hurting our district.\"\n\nThe competitive match-up for Missouri's First Congressional District came weeks after incumbent New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman became the first Squad member to lose a primary this year when moderate Westchester County Executive George Latimer defeated him in June. Nearly $25 million was spent on ads, making it the most expensive primary race in the country. According to Ad Impact, Tuesday's contest ranked second, with roughly $19 million in total spending.\n\n\"There is concern which is why we, you know,  have such a ground game that is just amazing,\" Bush told CBS News. \"We understand what's at stake.\"\n\nBowman joined Bush in a virtual campaign call Monday, along with several other fellow Squad members, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Summer Lee.\n\n\"I know exactly what you're going through,\" said Bowman, who called his loss \"unfortunate.\" \"I know what it feels like to be constantly bombarded with ads and mailers and lies and B.S. that completely distorts who you are and your record.\"\n\nThe pro-Israel super PAC United Democracy Project, an affiliate of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, spent more than $14.8 million criticizing Bowman's record. The same organization doled out more than $9 million in support of Bell and opposing Bush. The group has targeted Bush over her early calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and her criticism of Israel's offensive against Hamas. At one point, she accused Israel of conducting an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\"  Most of the super PAC's ads have centered around her vote against the Democratic infrastructure bill and her overall record.\n\n\"This level of spending is a testament to the strength of Cori Bush - that one individual former nurse and single mother fighting for working people in her district is such a threat to right-wing interests, corporate power and Republican megadonors, that they have to drag our democracy through the mud to even have a shot at challenging her,\" said Usamah Andrabi of Justice Democrats, which has spent roughly $2.4 million to boost Bush.\n\n\"These are some of the same donors and donations that the congresswoman went after in her last elections,\" Bell responded. \"So, it seems a little bit like sour grapes. It seems a little bit hypocritical that when I get that kind of support it must be for nefarious reasons.\n\nBush and Bell did not debate during the primary, but the two have tangled over a range of issues. Last week, a recording of a phone call between the two candidates in June 2023 was leaked, and according to the recording posted online at Drop Site , Bell told Bush, \"I am not running against you.\"\n\n\"I just wish he would have told the truth from the beginning,\" Bush quipped. \"It was no reason to say 'no,' and to say, you know, in his words, 'you have my word.'\"\n\nBell claims he was \"secretly recorded\" while he was exploring a Senate run last year. He said his perspective changed after speaking with voters.\n\n\"This isn't anything personal with the congresswoman,\" Bell explained. \"It's personal because I care about this district and this region.\"\n\nAnother flashpoint is the handling of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Friday marks the 10th anniversary since the 18-year-old was shot by a local police officer, Darren Wilson, sparking massive demonstrations. Bush was one of the key organizers on the ground and has remained close to the Brown family. Bell, a former municipal prosecutor and judge, served on the Ferguson City Council. When Bell became county prosecutor, he reopened an investigation into Brown's death, but in 2020 announced that no charges would be brought against Wilson.\n\nIn one of Bush's closing ads , Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., claims Bell \"lied to us\" because of his failure to charge Wilson.\n\n\"I don't know what else we could have done,\" Bell countered. \"We promised to look into it, and we did that. We did a thorough investigation, looked into it, but without any new evidence, unfortunately, it is what it is. And I made a promise as county prosecutor that we don't prosecute people without evidence.\"\n\nIf elected, Bell says he plans to focus on an array of issues including jobs, gun safety and affordable healthcare.\n\n\"That's what I intend to take to D.C., that spirit of working together and getting things done,\" Bell said.\n\nBush remains hopeful Democrats can secure the majority in November. If she wins another term, she plans to continue her work around reproductive rights, helping the unhoused and advancing the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\"There's quite a few things on my list,\" Bush said.\n\nNikole Killion is a CBS News congressional correspondent based in Washington D.C.

      "text": "Cori Bush explains her position on \"defund the police\" while paying for private security. Her full response.\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nAugust 6, 2021 / 10:59 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush explained her position on \"defunding the police\" while also defending her spending on private security, in an interview Wednesday with CBS News.\n\nCorrespondent and anchor Vladimir Duthiers asked Bush to respond to critics who say it's \"hypocritical\" that she has spent $70,000 on private security while continuing to push for reforms to funding for police departments.\n\nBush stood by both positions in the interview, which was largely focused on the eviction moratorium and aired on CBSN , the network's streaming news channel.\n\nHere is a transcript of that exchange from the interview:\n\nDuthiers : Congresswoman, before we let you go, let me ask you about something else. Aside from the moratorium, you faced some criticism in recent weeks over your push to defund the police. Campaign records show that you spent roughly $70,000 on private security and some critics say that move is hypocritical. What's your response to those critics?\n\nBush: They would rather I die? You would rather me die? Is that what you want to see? You want to see me die? You know, because that could be the alternative. So either I spent $70,000 on private security over the last few months, and I'm here standing now and able to speak, able to help save 11 million people from being evicted. Or - I could possibly have a death attempt on my life.\n\nAnd we're also talking about the same exact people who say horrible things about me, who lie to build up their base. And then because they lie about me, I receive death threats. Now they don't address the fact that I receive death threats after they go on air and say horrible things about me. But then they want to say, 'Oh, but she wants, she needs private security.'\n\nI have private security because my body is worth being on this planet right now. I have private security because they, the white supremacist racist narrative that they drive into this country. The fact that they don't care that this Black woman that has put her life on the line, they can't match my energy first of all.\n\nThis Black woman who puts her life on the line. They don't care that I could be taken out of here. They actually probably are OK with that, but this is the thing: I won't let them get that off. You can't get that off. I'm going to make sure I have security because I know I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do. There are too many people that need help right now for me to allow that.\n\nSo if I end up spending $200,000, if I spend 10, 10, 10 more dollars on it, you know what, I get to be here to do the work. So suck it up and defunding the police has to happen. We need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets because we're trying to save lives.\n\nWhat other, what other occupation can do work that's out of their scope and still be propped up to do work that's out of their scope. As a nurse, I can't be the surgeon, too. You don't want me being your surgeon and I'm the nurse.\n\nAt what point do we pay police to be social workers? No, we don't. How do they get to be social workers? So, what I'm saying is, You do your job. Let the people who have gone to school with a particular skillset, do theirs. Neither defunding the police, and being able to have security because those same folks are causing it. It's two totally different things.\n\nAnd this is my last point on this: If I have actual police officers who have threatened my life, tell me about that. Tell me, tell me that I don't need security.\n\nAnd let me just say this last thing: My security is not against communal violence. My security is not to keep me safe from the people of St. Louis. My security is to keep me safe from those racist attempts made against my life. Now, if you want to do something about that, stand up and do something about that.\n\nI didn't see any of those people that have come against me with this negativity, with these lies, with these smears stand up when they saw the N-word, when they saw me post stuff about me being hung, the threats on my life, hanging me and burning me, frying me and my family like bacon.\n\nThey didn't say anything about that. And that was just a piece of what I receive all the time. But you know what? I take that. And I walk with my head up and my shoulders back, because I know I'm doing the work for the people. I'm on the right side of history. And if they want, they can come and meet me to my face. You come and meet me too. You come and stand on these steps and fight for the people this way. You show up and fight for the people the way that I have. You put your body on the line, the way that I put my body on the line. And until you can do that, I suggest you take several seats.\n\nAnchor Anne-Marie Green: Congresswoman, have you had police officers threaten you?\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, I've been doing, I've been in this fight for seven years. I'm a Ferguson activist. That's happened to us. That has happened to us. It's not just me. Ferguson, frontline that has happened to us multiple. I mean, it's more times than we can count. But we're not -\n\nDuthiers: But even now, as a member of Congress, you've had police officers threaten your life.\n\nI mean, and they're, they're still people. And you know what the thing is, they can threaten my life and I'm still working for them. I'm still going to work for them. I'm still going to make sure their families are taken care of because I'm no respecter of persons. If you have a need, I'm going to take care of you. Because that's my job. I love the people. 100%. I don't care what your occupation is. I don't care if you like me - at all. I'm still going to do the work to make sure that your family has clean water, clean air, healthcare, a place to live and all of that, because that is who we have to be. Just love humanity.\n\nDuthiers: Presumably, Congresswoman, I would hope that those, as you alleged, those police officers would be removed, or at least you would let your security detail and the mechanisms in place in Congress to ensure that those officers are not still patrolling the streets.\n\nWell, you know, it's- work is being done. You know, there's nothing that comes in that is not being handled. So we're fine. We're fine. We'll keep moving.\n\nGreen: Congresswoman, it sounds like you are handling things. I was just, as I was listening to you, I thought to myself, did she have any idea, the challenges that she was facing when she took this job and decided to go to our nation's Capitol? I'm just sort of curious about your reaction to this. You know it's going to be a tough job, but it's something else to believe that your life is at risk.\n\nYeah, but it was a tough job being out on the streets of Ferguson for more than 400 days with real bullets and rubber bullets, with white supremacist threats, with being terrorized and tear gas and brutal assaults, constantly day after day being heavily surveilled and harassed and intimidated over and over again.\n\nAnd that didn't just happen during the Ferguson uprising. It continued on for many years. So that was difficult. Standing before those tanks - that was difficult. Having guns in my face pointed at me - that was difficult. Watching my friends beaten and brutalized - that was difficult. So this is like - St. Louis prepared me for this.\n\nSo I don't feel like this is oh so much worse than what I've dealt with all of this time. Shout outs to the Ferguson activists who do not get exposure that don't where people don't know your story. I'm shouting you out right now. All of my St. Louis activists.\n\nDuthiers: Congresswoman, I remember seeing you out on the streets of Ferguson back in 2014, and I remember thinking to myself that you were somebody who was taking it to the street. And I just, I don't know if you, as Anne-Marie said, if you thought in your mind back then, as it was all unfolding all the weeks and weeks and weeks that you spent out there protesting racial injustice, that you would one day, put your hand on the Bible and take that oath of office. Did you imagine that?\n\nNot at all, you could not, if you would have said that to me because I had already said years before that I would never run for office. I would never, because my dad, Earl Bush, has been in politics for most of my life. And I saw a good man do great things. And I saw so much like greed and corruption and just people trying to just hurt his, damage his name. I was like, Why would anybody want to do that? So, no, no. But the moment called, the people called and asked me to do it. So I stepped up. But no, absolutely not.\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Cori Bush, member of \"The Squad,\" projected to lose Democratic primary to challenger Wesley Bell\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  August 7, 2024 / 9:16 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nDemocratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri lost her reelection bid Tuesday to primary challenger Wesley Bell, a St. Louis County prosecutor, the Associated Press projected, becoming the second member of the progressive congressional group known as \" The Squad \" to lose her seat.\n\nWhen Bush was elected in 2020, she became the first Black woman to represent Missouri, the first nurse and the first organizer from the Black Lives Matter movement in Congress. The primary race in Missouri's 1st Congressional District between Bush and Bell was the second most expensive House primary in 2024.\n\n\"My community knows who I am,\" Bush previously told CBS News. \"This district has seen me for the last 10 years going from the activist to the 'politivist,' which is what I call myself. They know that about me. They know that I am going to fight for the people in the streets.\"\n\nBush rose to national prominence after defeating longtime incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in 2020. She cruised to victory in 2022 but the two-term congresswoman faced her toughest political fight yet against Bell.\n\n\"The congresswoman is not doing her job,\" Bell said in an interview with CBS News. \"She is not working with others, and it's hurting our district.\"\n\nThe competitive match-up for Missouri's First Congressional District came weeks after incumbent New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman became the first Squad member to lose a primary this year when moderate Westchester County Executive George Latimer defeated him in June. Nearly $25 million was spent on ads, making it the most expensive primary race in the country. According to Ad Impact, Tuesday's contest ranked second, with roughly $19 million in total spending.\n\n\"There is concern which is why we, you know,  have such a ground game that is just amazing,\" Bush told CBS News. \"We understand what's at stake.\"\n\nBowman joined Bush in a virtual campaign call Monday, along with several other fellow Squad members, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Summer Lee.\n\n\"I know exactly what you're going through,\" said Bowman, who called his loss \"unfortunate.\" \"I know what it feels like to be constantly bombarded with ads and mailers and lies and B.S. that completely distorts who you are and your record.\"\n\nThe pro-Israel super PAC United Democracy Project, an affiliate of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, spent more than $14.8 million criticizing Bowman's record. The same organization doled out more than $9 million in support of Bell and opposing Bush. The group has targeted Bush over her early calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and her criticism of Israel's offensive against Hamas. At one point, she accused Israel of conducting an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\"  Most of the super PAC's ads have centered around her vote against the Democratic infrastructure bill and her overall record.\n\n\"This level of spending is a testament to the strength of Cori Bush - that one individual former nurse and single mother fighting for working people in her district is such a threat to right-wing interests, corporate power and Republican megadonors, that they have to drag our democracy through the mud to even have a shot at challenging her,\" said Usamah Andrabi of Justice Democrats, which has spent roughly $2.4 million to boost Bush.\n\n\"These are some of the same donors and donations that the congresswoman went after in her last elections,\" Bell responded. \"So, it seems a little bit like sour grapes. It seems a little bit hypocritical that when I get that kind of support it must be for nefarious reasons.\n\nBush and Bell did not debate during the primary, but the two have tangled over a range of issues. Last week, a recording of a phone call between the two candidates in June 2023 was leaked, and according to the recording posted online at Drop Site , Bell told Bush, \"I am not running against you.\"\n\n\"I just wish he would have told the truth from the beginning,\" Bush quipped. \"It was no reason to say 'no,' and to say, you know, in his words, 'you have my word.'\"\n\nBell claims he was \"secretly recorded\" while he was exploring a Senate run last year. He said his perspective changed after speaking with voters.\n\n\"This isn't anything personal with the congresswoman,\" Bell explained. \"It's personal because I care about this district and this region.\"\n\nAnother flashpoint is the handling of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Friday marks the 10th anniversary since the 18-year-old was shot by a local police officer, Darren Wilson, sparking massive demonstrations. Bush was one of the key organizers on the ground and has remained close to the Brown family. Bell, a former municipal prosecutor and judge, served on the Ferguson City Council. When Bell became county prosecutor, he reopened an investigation into Brown's death, but in 2020 announced that no charges would be brought against Wilson.\n\nIn one of Bush's closing ads , Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., claims Bell \"lied to us\" because of his failure to charge Wilson.\n\n\"I don't know what else we could have done,\" Bell countered. \"We promised to look into it, and we did that. We did a thorough investigation, looked into it, but without any new evidence, unfortunately, it is what it is. And I made a promise as county prosecutor that we don't prosecute people without evidence.\"\n\nIf elected, Bell says he plans to focus on an array of issues including jobs, gun safety and affordable healthcare.\n\n\"That's what I intend to take to D.C., that spirit of working together and getting things done,\" Bell said.\n\nBush remains hopeful Democrats can secure the majority in November. If she wins another term, she plans to continue her work around reproductive rights, helping the unhoused and advancing the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n\"There's quite a few things on my list,\" Bush said.\n\nNikole Killion is a CBS News congressional correspondent based in Washington D.C.

      "text": "Cori Bush explains her position on \"defund the police\" while paying for private security. Her full response.\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nAugust 6, 2021 / 10:59 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush explained her position on \"defunding the police\" while also defending her spending on private security, in an interview Wednesday with CBS News.\n\nCorrespondent and anchor Vladimir Duthiers asked Bush to respond to critics who say it's \"hypocritical\" that she has spent $70,000 on private security while continuing to push for reforms to funding for police departments.\n\nBush stood by both positions in the interview, which was largely focused on the eviction moratorium and aired on CBSN , the network's streaming news channel.\n\nHere is a transcript of that exchange from the interview:\n\nDuthiers : Congresswoman, before we let you go, let me ask you about something else. Aside from the moratorium, you faced some criticism in recent weeks over your push to defund the police. Campaign records show that you spent roughly $70,000 on private security and some critics say that move is hypocritical. What's your response to those critics?\n\nBush: They would rather I die? You would rather me die? Is that what you want to see? You want to see me die? You know, because that could be the alternative. So either I spent $70,000 on private security over the last few months, and I'm here standing now and able to speak, able to help save 11 million people from being evicted. Or - I could possibly have a death attempt on my life.\n\nAnd we're also talking about the same exact people who say horrible things about me, who lie to build up their base. And then because they lie about me, I receive death threats. Now they don't address the fact that I receive death threats after they go on air and say horrible things about me. But then they want to say, 'Oh, but she wants, she needs private security.'\n\nI have private security because my body is worth being on this planet right now. I have private security because they, the white supremacist racist narrative that they drive into this country. The fact that they don't care that this Black woman that has put her life on the line, they can't match my energy first of all.\n\nThis Black woman who puts her life on the line. They don't care that I could be taken out of here. They actually probably are OK with that, but this is the thing: I won't let them get that off. You can't get that off. I'm going to make sure I have security because I know I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do. There are too many people that need help right now for me to allow that.\n\nSo if I end up spending $200,000, if I spend 10, 10, 10 more dollars on it, you know what, I get to be here to do the work. So suck it up and defunding the police has to happen. We need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets because we're trying to save lives.\n\nWhat other, what other occupation can do work that's out of their scope and still be propped up to do work that's out of their scope. As a nurse, I can't be the surgeon, too. You don't want me being your surgeon and I'm the nurse.\n\nAt what point do we pay police to be social workers? No, we don't. How do they get to be social workers? So, what I'm saying is, You do your job. Let the people who have gone to school with a particular skillset, do theirs. Neither defunding the police, and being able to have security because those same folks are causing it. It's two totally different things.\n\nAnd this is my last point on this: If I have actual police officers who have threatened my life, tell me about that. Tell me, tell me that I don't need security.\n\nAnd let me just say this last thing: My security is not against communal violence. My security is not to keep me safe from the people of St. Louis. My security is to keep me safe from those racist attempts made against my life. Now, if you want to do something about that, stand up and do something about that.\n\nI didn't see any of those people that have come against me with this negativity, with these lies, with these smears stand up when they saw the N-word, when they saw me post stuff about me being hung, the threats on my life, hanging me and burning me, frying me and my family like bacon.\n\nThey didn't say anything about that. And that was just a piece of what I receive all the time. But you know what? I take that. And I walk with my head up and my shoulders back, because I know I'm doing the work for the people. I'm on the right side of history. And if they want, they can come and meet me to my face. You come and meet me too. You come and stand on these steps and fight for the people this way. You show up and fight for the people the way that I have. You put your body on the line, the way that I put my body on the line. And until you can do that, I suggest you take several seats.\n\nAnchor Anne-Marie Green: Congresswoman, have you had police officers threaten you?\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, I've been doing, I've been in this fight for seven years. I'm a Ferguson activist. That's happened to us. That has happened to us. It's not just me. Ferguson, frontline that has happened to us multiple. I mean, it's more times than we can count. But we're not -\n\nDuthiers: But even now, as a member of Congress, you've had police officers threaten your life.\n\nI mean, and they're, they're still people. And you know what the thing is, they can threaten my life and I'm still working for them. I'm still going to work for them.

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush marks Juneteenth with push for reparations\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 19, 2023 / 2:57 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - As Americans commemorate the emancipation of enslaved people on Juneteenth , Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri is using the federal holiday to advance new legislation for reparations for their descendants.\n\n\"This is the moment to put it out and we needed something like this,\" said Bush. \"I feel it is the first of its kind on the Congressional Record.\"\n\nBush introduced H.R. 414, The Reparations Now Resolution, in May. The 23-page measure makes the case for federal reparations, citing a \"moral and legal obligation\" for the U.S. to address the \"enslavement of Africans and its lasting harm\" on millions of Black Americans.\n\nThe bill would support other pieces of reparatory justice legislation and formally acknowledge the momentum of state and local reparations movements. The Missouri Democrat believes ongoing efforts in Evanston , Boston , San Francisco and her hometown of St. Louis could galvanize support for reparations on the federal level.\n\n\"Our mayor just put together a commission to be able to work on what reparations would look like for St. Louis,\" said Bush, who has the backing of nearly 300 grassroots organizations. \"Because we're seeing it on the local level, that's where a big part of that push will come from, I believe.\"\n\nThe resolution does not stipulate direct cash payments but recommends the federal government pay $14 trillion \"to eliminate the racial wealth gap that currently exists between Black and White Americans.\"\n\nBush called it a \"starting point\" and cited scholars who estimate the U.S. benefited from over 222 million hours of forced labor between 1619 and the end of slavery in 1865, a value of approximately $97 trillion today.\n\n\"This country thrived and grew through the planting and harvesting of tobacco, sugar, rice and cotton, all from chattel slavery, and that hasn't been compensated,\" she said.\n\nThe legislation builds upon a decadeslong push in Congress for reparations. Earlier this year, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both Democrats, reintroduced H.R. 40 and S.40, which would establish a commission to study and develop reparations proposals for African Americans. Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California also re-upped a bill last month to create the first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation to examine the impact of slavery.\n\nLee is one of several Democratic co-sponsors of Bush's resolution. Bush said she is waiting to hear from House Democratic leadership on her measure but realizes it could be a non-starter for Republicans in the GOP-controlled House who contend reparations could be too costly and divisive.\n\n\"I am going to be calling folks out on this,\" Bush forewarned. \"There has to be restitution and compensation. There has to be rehabilitation and so that is what I'm going to throw back at them.\"\n\nA Pew Research Center study found 48% of Democrats surveyed believe descendants of enslaved people should be repaid in some way, while 91% of Republicans think they should not.\n\nA progressive, second-term lawmaker, Bush spent two years working on the reparations resolution. She said it was one of her top priorities before she was sworn into Congress, dating back to her time as a community activist.\n\n\"I remember being on the ground in Ferguson and feeling like, 'Hey, we're doing all of this on the ground but we don't have anybody in Congress that's like picking this up and running with it,'\" Bush recalled. \"We're making these soft pitches, and [there's] nobody to hit a home run. Well, that has changed. So now we're in a position to hit the ball.\"\n\nNikole Killion is a CBS News congressional correspondent based in Washington D.C.

Bush said her colleague \"threatened\" and \"berated\" both her and her staff.\n\nGreene has been widely condemned by many House Democrats, as she has promoted a host of conspiracy theories and agreed with statements that Democrats should be executed. A House Democrat says he plans to introduce a motion as early as next week to expel her from the chamber.\n\nBush initially tweeted that she was moving her office because of Greene's behavior on Friday. In a later statement, Bush described an incident on January 13 in the tunnel between the Cannon House Office Building and the Capitol, when she said Greene \"came up from behind me, ranting loudly into her phone while not wearing a mask.\" The day before, several Democrats had announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19 after being in lockdown with Republican members who refused to wear masks during the attack on the Capitol on January 6.\n\n\"Out of concern for the health of my staff, other members of Congress, and their congressional staff, I repeatedly called out to her to put on a mask. Taylor Greene and her staff responded by berating me, with one staffer yelling, 'Stop inciting violence with Black Lives Matter'\" Bush continued. Greene also \"lashed out\" against Bush on Twitter on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Bush said, \"to falsely accuse me of leading a mob that called for 'the rape, murder, and burning of the home'\" of the McCloskey family in St. Louis - thus naming me as a target to her hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers.\"\n\n\"All of this led to my decision to move my office away from Taylor Greene's for the safety of my team. My office is currently being relocated from the Longworth House Office Building,\" Bush said. An aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed to CBS News that the room assignment change was by the direct order of the speaker upon request from Bush.\n\nBush later tweeted that she didn't move her office \"out of fear.\"\n\n\"I moved my office because I'm here to do a job for the people of St. Louis,\" she wrote. \"What I cannot do is continue to look over my shoulder wondering if a white supremacist in Congress is conspiring against me and my team.\"\n\nGreene posted a video on Twitter on Friday afternoon challenging Bush's claim. The video shows Greene walking through the tunnels under the Capitol when someone, allegedly Bush, yells at her to follow the rules and wear a mask. In the tweet, Greene says that Bush is the \"leader of the St. Louis Black Lives Matter terrorist mob\" who \"is lying to you\" and \"berated me.\"\n\nSince being sworn in earlier this month, Greene has received pushback from her colleagues in Congress. California Democrat Jimmy Gomez is expected introduce his resolution to expel Greene from the House of Representatives as early as next Tuesday.\n\nIn a Wednesday night statement announcing his plan, Gomez cited Green's amplification of conspiracy theories relating to the September 11th terrorist attacks and the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as well as her past support for social media posts calling for violence against Pelosi and other Democratic politicians. Gomez's call for Greene's resignation has been echoed by the parents of some of the students who were killed during the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida. On Thursday, CNN reported on the existence a video from 2019 where Greene is pictured harassing teenager David Hogg, a survivor of the shooting.\n\nConnecticut Democrat Jahana Hayes - who represents the district where Newtown, the site of another school shooting, is located - sent a letter to House Republican leadership and the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee, North Carolina Representative Virginia Foxx, to strip Greene of her new assignment to that committee.\n\nMedia Matters for America reported on Thursday that Greene had written a Facebook post in 2018 with the anti-Semitic claim that a laser from space controlled by a nefarious group had started wildfires in California.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for Greene told CBS News that she will not resign .\n\n\"They are coming after me because I'm a threat to their goal of Socialism. They are coming after me because they know I represent the people, not the politicians. They are coming after me because like President Trump, I will always defend conservative values. They want to take me out because I represent the people. And they absolutely hate it,\" Greene said in a statement.\n\nGrace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "'Squad' member Cori Bush loses Democratic primary in Missouri\n\nFollow:\n\nMissouri Rep. Cori Bush has lost her Democratic primary to St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, securing another win for the same pro-Israel groups that helped oust New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman six weeks ago.\n\nBush, a member of the House \"squad\" of progressive lawmakers like Bowman, was already earmarked for a tough primary in Missouri's 1st Congressional District - which ended up being the second-most expensive primary of the cycle, behind only Bowman's race in New York. Her fierce advocacy for a ceasefire in Gaza added fuel to opponents' fire.\n\nAnd in similar fashion to Bowman, Bush - despite the backing of progressive groups, local leaders and top congressional Democrats - was unable to fend off Bell, who, like Bush, rose to prominence during the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a decade ago following the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown.\n\nWith his victory Tuesday, Bell will be heavily favored in the general election for the solid blue St. Louis-area seat. His win also marks the second time in three cycles that a challenger has unseated the incumbent in the 1st District Democratic primary - Bush defeated Rep. William Lacy Clay in the 2020 contest.\n\nBell first entered elective politics in 2015, when he won a seat on the Ferguson City Council. Three years later, he was the first Black St. Louis County prosecutor, unseating longtime incumbent Robert McCulloch.\n\n\"What we had, that he did not have, was the power of people,\" Bell told supporters that night in 2018.\n\nRelated article Pro-Israel groups look to oust another progressive 'squad' member, this time in Missouri\n\nBut his decision not to bring charges against the officer who shot Brown frustrated some in the community, including Brown's father, who cut an ad for Bush in the closing days of the race in which he says: \"I feel like (Bell) lied to us.\"\n\nIn the primary, Bush sought to cast Bell as a vehicle for corporate donors far removed from the community that elected him - and that he is now likely to represent in Congress next year.\n\n\"By supporting our grassroots campaign,\" Bush said in a recent fundraising email, \"you're standing up against a grifter politician and the influence of big money in politics and demanding real representation for the people of MO-01.\"\n\nBut her defeat will be blow to House progressives, who rallied around Bowman earlier this year, only to see him lose by more than 15 points to a more moderate opponent in the Democratic primary. Both Bush and Bowman came under criticism from their opponents for lodging protest votes against President Joe Biden 's bipartisan infrastructure bill - which was not as climate-friendly as they had hoped - on its way to passage in 2021. ( Only six Democrats , in all, joined most Republicans in opposition.)\n\n\"She sold out our president, and she sold out the city of St. Louis,\" a person says in an ad by the United Democracy Project , the super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The group spent about $9 million on ads attacking Bush or boosting Bell.\n\nBush's infrastructure vote and her early, strident advocacy for a halt to the fighting in Gaza were her main vulnerabilities, though her rivals also argued she focused too much on national politics and not enough on her district.\n\nAn ad by the Mainstream Democrats PAC also attacked her for being the subject of a federal investigation over alleged misuse of campaign funds for security services. Bush has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that she complied with House rules.\n\nBell had no shortage of local endorsers, but, in addition the United Democracy Project's big outlay, big spenders on his behalf included the Democratic Majority for Israel, the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC and billionaire Reid Hoffman's Mainstream Democrats.\n\nBush is the fourth House member to lose a primary this year. In March, Rep. Jerry Carl lost an all-incumbent Republican primary in Alabama to Rep. Barry Moore after both ran for the same seat following redistricting. Bowman lost his primary in June, and last week, Virginia Rep. Bob Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, conceded his Republican primary after a recount upheld his June defeat.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's David Wright contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Pro-Israel groups look to oust another progressive 'squad' member, this time in Missouri\n\nFollow:\n\nSix weeks after leading the charge to oust Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a New York primary, a big-spending pro-Israel super PAC is hoping to help defeat another member of the House \"squad\" of progressive Democrats - Missouri Rep. Cori Bush.\n\nAlready a top target for centrist and Israel-aligned groups, Bush broke ranks with her party's leadership to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza last year and has been fiercely critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinian civilians.\n\nBush has drawn three challengers as she seeks a third term representing Missouri's 1st Congressional District, the most prominent of whom is Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney of St. Louis County. The spending in the race has not matched the campaign against Bowman - the most expensive House primary in US history.\n\nNevertheless, the figures - for a safe blue district and one of 435 House seats - are remarkable. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee's super PAC, United Democracy Project, has spent nearly $9 million on ads attacking Bush or boosting Bell.\n\nThough Bell has been more supportive of Israel's actions, his campaign has not focused on the issue, and voters in the majority-minority, urban district in the St. Louis area are not clashing over it with the passion seen in in more typically progressive enclaves.\n\nTaking a page from Democrat George Latimer, who defeated Bowman in New York in June, Bell's campaign has been more vibes-based - criticizing Bush for being too ideologically-driven, not being responsive enough to her constituents and - perhaps most potently - voting against President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill.\n\nRelated article George Latimer defeats House 'squad' member Jamaal Bowman in historic New York Democratic primary\n\n\"She sold out our president, and she sold out the city of St. Louis,\" a person says in a United Democracy Project ad .\n\nThat vote, like Bowman's, was lodged in protest of certain aspects of the infrastructure legislation. (The measure, however, had enough support to be passed without their votes.)\n\nAn ad from the Mainstream Democrats PAC attacked Bush for being the subject of a federal investigation over alleged misuse of campaign funds for security services. Bush has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that she complied with House rules.\n\nBush's message during the campaign has been simpler and, in many ways, mimics Bowman's efforts to cast the race as a battle between big money and the grassroots\n\n\"By supporting our grassroots campaign,\" Bush said in a recent fundraising email, \"you're standing up against a grifter politician and the influence of big money in politics and demanding real representation for the people of MO-01.\"\n\nIt's a tactic that had, before this summer, been effective for progressive House members facing well-financed challengers. Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee fended off a primary challenge for her Pittsburgh-area seat earlier in the year and other \"squad\" members, most notably New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, are now widely seen as invulnerable.\n\nThe Bush-Bell contest, though, is deeper than it is wide. There is no policy gulf to speak of; they are mostly aligned on the broad spectrum of issues that come before House members. They both have strong ties to 2014 police killing of Michael Brown , an unarmed Black teenager, in Ferguson, which is located in Missouri's 1st District. The outrage around Brown's death effectively launched the Black Lives Matter movement. Bush, a pastor, became a prominent activist in those demonstrations and she parlayed that profile into twice challenge the 1st District incumbent, William Lacy Clay, in the Democratic primary, succeeding in 2020 on her second attempt.\n\nBell, in contrast, had an earlier start in the political arena. He was elected to the Ferguson City Council in 2015. Three years later, running on a progressive platform, he unseated the controversial St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who had been in office since 1991. But like McCulloch, Bell did not charge the officer who shot Brown, irritating some supporters - including Brown's father, who was featured last month in an ad for Bush.\n\n\"I feel like he lied to us. He never brought charges against the killer,\" Brown Sr. says in the spot . \"He never walked the streets of Ferguson with me. He failed to reform the office.\"\n\nIn late October 2023, weeks after Hamas' deadly attack inside Israel, Bell backed out of a Senate run against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley to announce that he would challenge Bush instead. At a news conference at the time, he suggested that the congresswoman's stance on the conflict - she was among the first to call for a ceasefire - drew him to the race.\n\n\"Understand this unique place that we are with the world literally on fire,\" Bell said. \"I think that we need to make certain that we are providing that effective leadership, not only in our district but in DC and on the world stage.\"\n\nIncidentally, a few months earlier, Bell had told Bush in a phone call - first reported by KSDK in St. Louis - that he had no intention of challenging her.\n\n\"Don't even think for even a second that that's the case,\" Bell told the congresswoman. \"I'm telling you, on my word, I am not running against you. That is not happening.\"\n\nRelated article Harris steps out on Israel as she navigates Biden and Netanyahu\n\nBut now it is. Bell's campaign hasn't disputed what was said on the phone call, instead arguing that the assurance was given ahead of the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. His campaign manager told KSDK that Bell decided to leave the Senate primary for the House race after receiving \"encouragement\" from \"stakeholders at the local, statewide, and national level.\"\n\nSince then, it's been a familiar proxy clash between old foes.\n\nAIPAC's United Democracy Project and another pro-Israel group, Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, have invested in Bell's cause, along with the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC and billionaire Reid Hoffman's Mainstream Democrats PAC. In Bush's corner, Justice Democrats, the group that became famous for recruiting Ocasio-Cortez to first run for office, and the Working Families Party are spending to defend their left-wing ally. The relative outlays, though, are stark - Bell-backers have outspent Bush's side by about 3-to-1 on advertising.\n\nAs the incumbent, Bush does have the backing, at least on paper, from House Democratic leadership, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are also on board. Ocasio-Cortez sent out fundraising appeals for the Bush campaign. At home, St. Louis City Mayor Tishaura Jones has also endorsed her.\n\nBut support for Bell is robust locally too - often a more important mark of how a low-turnout primary will pan out than any other metric. Indivisible St. Louis endorsed Bell, who also has vast support from labor. The editorial board of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is also backing the challenger.\n\nTop Washington Democrats have been fairly quiet, not-so-subtly signaling that Bell will be welcome. Many are still cross with Bush for ousting Clay four years ago, breaking his family's grip on a seat they'd held since before man walked on the moon.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's David Wright contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Cori Bush (D-Mo.) will sleep on the steps of the Capitol on Friday in a push to extend the federal eviction moratorium, which is set to expire tomorrow.\n\nBush sent a tweet late Thursday and multiple letters throughout the day imploring other House Democrats to return from their adjournment and vote on the Protecting Renters from Evictions Act of 2021 .\n\n\"I cannot in good conscience leave Washington tonight while a Democratic-controlled government allows millions of people to go unhoused as the Delta variant is ravaging our communities. Millions of people are about to lose their homes and, as Democrats, we must not give up on the chance to save their lives,\" Bush said in a letter to her colleagues .\n\nBush, who has previously experienced homelessness, called the House of Representatives' decision to adjourn before voting on the act a \"moral failure.\"\n\n\"I have been unhoused and evicted. I've slept in my car and slept outdoors. I know what it's like, and I wouldn't wish that trauma on anyone,\" Bush said.\n\nNearly 6.2 million American households are at risk of eviction, according to The New York Times . Despite the passage of emergency rental assistance, Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, told the House Coronavirus Crisis Select Subcommittee Tuesday that these funds have yet to reach the vast majority of renters in need. Yentel said that nearly half of all states and more than 100 cities have distributed less than 5% of these funds.\n\n\"We have a deeply rooted misconception in our country that unhoused people have done something to deserve their conditions-when the reality is that unhoused people are living the consequences of our government's failure to secure the basic necessities people need to survive.\" Bush said. \"In the wealthiest country in the world-no one deserves to be unhoused.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "How vulnerable is 'The Squad?' What to watch as several progressives battle a wave of pro-Israel money in the next several months\n\nIn the next several months, \"The Squad\" will face its biggest electoral test yet.\n\nThe eight progressive Democrats who make up the informal group are known for being the furthest-left lawmakers in the House, their affiliations with the group \"Justice Democrats,\" and for being young lawmakers of color. All but one, Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, represent deep-blue seats.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks and the resulting war in Gaza, all of them have come under especially strong fire from the right flank of the Democratic Party. They each support a cease-fire in Gaza as the Israeli counteroffensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis. Many have also taken votes against symbolic pro-Israel resolutions in recent months.\n\nAfter spending big in Democratic primaries in 2022, pro-Israel groups are again working to defeat several Squad members by electing more moderate, pro-Israel Democrats in their place.\n\nUnited Democracy Project - a super PAC associated with the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC - is sitting on nearly $42 million in cash as of the end of January, much of which comes from Republican megadonors. Other pro-Israel groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel, are also expected to spend significant sums of money.\n\nSeveral Squad members now face not just well-funded primary challengers, but significant personal scandals that could cost them with former supporters.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario for the group, their ranks could be cut in half.\n\nHowever not all Squad members are endangered, and several of them are expected to cruise to reelection as the group faces primaries across 7 states between now and September.\n\nHere's what to know about their races.\n\nRep. Greg Casar of Texas may be the sole Squad member who could be called completely unendangered, at least this year.\n\nHe's running unopposed in his deep-blue Texas district, which stretches from Austin to San Antonio. Plus, the deadline has long passed for anyone to file to run against him.\n\nCasar is notably more cautious than other Squad members. Though he's called for a cease-fire in Gaza, he has taken fewer votes that could be seen as anti-Israel than others. He notably voted for a resolution in July declaring that Israel is \"not a racist or apartheid state.\"\n\nA former Austin city council member, Casar was first elected to Congress in 2022 with the support of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other progressives. He has since risen to become the whip of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nA former Pennsylvania state legislator, Lee may be the poster child for surviving an onslaught of pro-Israel spending.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent more than $4 million during the 2022 cycle in an effort to keep her out of Congress - not just during the hotly-contested Democratic primary that she won by less than 100 votes, but during the general election.\n\nThis year, Lee is in a stronger position, raising over $1 million in the last three months of 2023.

      "text": "How vulnerable is 'The Squad?' What to watch as several progressives battle a wave of pro-Israel money in the next several months\n\nIn the next several months, \"The Squad\" will face its biggest electoral test yet.\n\nThe eight progressive Democrats who make up the informal group are known for being the furthest-left lawmakers in the House, their affiliations with the group \"Justice Democrats,\" and for being young lawmakers of color. All but one, Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, represent deep-blue seats.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks and the resulting war in Gaza, all of them have come under especially strong fire from the right flank of the Democratic Party. They each support a cease-fire in Gaza as the Israeli counteroffensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis. Many have also taken votes against symbolic pro-Israel resolutions in recent months.\n\nAfter spending big in Democratic primaries in 2022, pro-Israel groups are again working to defeat several Squad members by electing more moderate, pro-Israel Democrats in their place.\n\nUnited Democracy Project - a super PAC associated with the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC - is sitting on nearly $42 million in cash as of the end of January, much of which comes from Republican megadonors. Other pro-Israel groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel, are also expected to spend significant sums of money.\n\nSeveral Squad members now face not just well-funded primary challengers, but significant personal scandals that could cost them with former supporters.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario for the group, their ranks could be cut in half.\n\nHowever not all Squad members are endangered, and several of them are expected to cruise to reelection as the group faces primaries across 7 states between now and September.\n\nHere's what to know about their races.\n\nRep. Greg Casar of Texas may be the sole Squad member who could be called completely unendangered, at least this year.\n\nHe's running unopposed in his deep-blue Texas district, which stretches from Austin to San Antonio. Plus, the deadline has long passed for anyone to file to run against him.\n\nCasar is notably more cautious than other Squad members. Though he's called for a cease-fire in Gaza, he has taken fewer votes that could be seen as anti-Israel than others. He notably voted for a resolution in July declaring that Israel is \"not a racist or apartheid state.\"\n\nA former Austin city council member, Casar was first elected to Congress in 2022 with the support of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other progressives. He has since risen to become the whip of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nA former Pennsylvania state legislator, Lee may be the poster child for surviving an onslaught of pro-Israel spending.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent more than $4 million during the 2022 cycle in an effort to keep her out of Congress - not just during the hotly-contested Democratic primary that she won by less than 100 votes, but during the general election.\n\nThis year, Lee is in a stronger position, raising over $1 million in the last three months of 2023. She also has the backing of House Democratic leadership and the advantage of incumbency.\n\nShe also faces two opponents in the April 23 primary who could potentially split the vote against her, including Edgewood Borough Councilwoman Bhavini Patel and Laurie MacDonald, the president and CEO of the Center for Victims.\n\nOn June 25, Democratic primary voters will head to the polls in New York.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is almost certainly safe.

      "text": "Incoming Rep. Cori Bush is showing off her thrifted outfits to normalize secondhand fashion on Capitol Hill\n\nIncoming Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri has detailed on Twitter what she describes as the \"expensive\" reality of dressing the part to serve on Capitol Hill - and how she's building her congressional wardrobe with thrifted finds.\n\nThe newly elected representative, who is undergoing orientation as a freshman member of the 117th Congress , is documenting her shopping expeditions for her supporters and followers on social media. On November 11, she shared a series of videos of thrifted pieces she's found.\n\nOne day earlier, Bush tweeted about her decision to build her congressional wardrobe using thrifted fashion. Her message garnered attention from fellow lawmakers and political candidates, who offered advice for how they style themselves on a budget.\n\n\"The reality of being a regular person going to Congress is that it's really expensive to get the business clothes I need for the Hill,\" Bush tweeted . \"So I'm going thrift shopping tomorrow. Should I do a fashion show?\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of many lawmakers to offer guidance to Bush. Ocasio-Cortez suggested practicing \"patience\" and creating a \"capsule wardrobe,\" or seasonal collections of easily interchangeable pieces.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has been vocal about thrifting and using clothing rental services to build her own Capitol Hill wardrobe , and about the reality that many lawmakers and political figures are loaned higher-end clothes for magazine photo shoots and media appearances .\n\nPam Keith , who ran in the 2020 election as a Democratic nominee to represent Florida's 18th district, seemed to echo Ocasio-Cortez's tip to lean on rental services. Keith said she uses Rent the Runway to add variety to her wardrobe.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan told Bush that she gets \"the most compliments\" on her thrifted outfits .\n\nBush's tweet and Tlaib's response caught the attention of a New Zealand lawmaker, Marama Davidson , who said that she wore a thrifted suit on the nation's election night.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York shared a recommendation with Bush for a Washington, DC-based consignment shop.\n\nFashion designer and former \"Project Runway\" winner Christian Siriano also chimed in , telling Bush he is \"happy to help.\"\n\nLike Bush and many of her congressional colleagues, shoppers - particularly Gen-Z consumers, according to a report from the online thrifting company ThredUp - are gradually leaning into thrifting and rental services as a more sustainable and oftentimes budget-friendly way of building a wardrobe.\n\nThredUp's 2020 report predicts that the resale market will nearly double in size, and be worth more than the fast fashion industry, by 2029.\n\nBush wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that she didn't want to show off all of her thrifted clothes so as not to spoil the outfits she'll wear starting in January at the start of her term. But until then, it seems she'll continue to show off her shopping journey to show that \"Thrifted IS congressional.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Christian Siriano did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nJump to"

Cori Bush loses Democratic primary after campaign onslaught from pro-Israel groups\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nRep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., has lost her primary, handing a pro-Israel group another victory against a member of the progressive \"squad\" of lawmakers.\n\nSt. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell has defeated Bush, NBC News projects. Bell is expected to carry Missouri's deep-blue 1st Congressional District in November after a primary that exposed the party's divisions on Israel, with Bush a vocal critic of the Israeli government and the country's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks on Oct. 7.\n\n\"I'll be a progressive member of Congress, but I'm also going to be a practical member of Congress,\" Bell told NBC News over the weekend. \"I recognize that we can't get anything done without majorities, and so that means we need to work with our fellow Democrats up there, and we also when we can reach across the aisle and work with folks to get things done for this region and for this country.\"\n\nUnited Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby, poured nearly $9 million onto the airwaves attacking Bush and boosting Bell. Bell had initially been running for the Senate, but he decided to challenge Bush in a primary a few weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nAnd the massive funding made the primary one of Tuesday's highest-profile races, as voters in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington voted for nominees in congressional races.\n\nWhile Bush's criticism of Israel drew millions of dollars into the race, the candidates launched other attacks against each other. Bell argued that Bush has not been an effective congresswoman, pointing to her votes against the bipartisan infrastructure package and the child tax credit.\n\nBush, meanwhile, focused her closing argument against Bell about the failure to bring charges against the police officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, featuring Brown's father in her final ad of the race.\n\nThe fallout from Brown's killing propelled both Bush's and Bell's careers - Bell as a prosecutor focused on police reform and Bush as a Black Lives Matter activist.\n\nBush indicated she may not be disappearing from political life.\n\n\"One thing I don't do is go away,\" Bush told NBC News over the weekend, noting that she made unsuccessful runs for Congress before her primary victory against longtime Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in 2020.\n\n\"The thing is it's not about me. So do we have a 'Medicare for All' right now? No. And so what happens on Aug. 6, it's not going to be delivered that day,\" she added later. \"So then that means that I still have to work for those things. I'm in the community, and I'm trying to have change for the community. And so I won't stop just because of a title change.\"\n\nBush wasn't the only Democratic incumbent facing a primary challenge Tuesday, but she was the only one who lost. Rep. Shri Thanedar won his primary against Detroit City Council Member Mary Waters, NBC News projects.\n\nTuesday's primaries also set the general election in Michigan's Senate race, with Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and GOP former Rep. Mike Rogers winning their primaries, NBC News projects.\n\nMichigan will be crucial in the battles for the Senate and the White House.\n\nSlotkin and Rogers were their party's front-runners heading into Tuesday's primaries. Slotkin, a prolific fundraiser who has spent more than $15 million on the race, defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic contest.\n\nRogers had former President Donald Trump's endorsement, and some of his top GOP opponents ended their campaigns before the primary. Rogers defeated former Rep. Justin Amash to win the Republican nomination.\n\nThe Michigan race is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country. President Joe Biden won the state by less than 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nSlotkin's Senate run also opened up her competitive 7th District, and the parties had coalesced around two former state senators: Republican Tom Barrett, who lost a close race to Slotkin two years ago, and Democrat Curtis Hertel.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet and Republican Paul Junge won their respective primaries in Michigan's competitive 8th District, NBC News projects, setting the matchup in the open seat contest to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee.\n\nJunge is a former criminal prosecutor and TV news anchor who served in the Trump administration and had Trump's endorsement in the primary. Junge also ran against Kildee in 2022, and lost by 10 points.\n\nIn another House battleground, Republicans picked physician Prasnath Reddy to take on Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids in Kansas' 3rd District. Davids has built up a financial advantage, with nearly $2.8 million in her campaign account ahead of the primary, while Reddy had $696,000 in his account.\n\nAnd in Washington, Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will have a rematch against Republican Joe Kent, The Associated Press projects. Kent is a controversial Army veteran who lost to Gluesenkamp Perez by 1 percentage point in 2022.\n\nKent, who has faced allegations about his ties to extreme groups , had Trump's endorsement in the primary, and he defeated Camas City Council member Leslie Lewallen for the GOP nomination.\n\nThe 3rd District is a top target for Republicans, as Gluesenkamp Perez is one of five Democrats representing districts Trump won in 2020.\n\nThe matchup was also set in Washington's competitive 8th District, with Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier facing off against Republican Carmen Goers, a commercial banker, in November.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Derek Schmidt won the GOP primary to replace retiring Republican Rep. Jake LaTurner in Kansas' red 2nd District, the AP projects. Schmidt got a boost from Trump's endorsement and from an outside group, Conservatives for American Excellence.\n\nIt's one of several Tuesday primaries in which Trump endorsed, including one in Washington featuring a rare Republican who voted to impeach him in 2021 and is still in Congress. GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse faces a pair of Trump-backed challengers in their all-party, top-two primary.\n\nTrump also notched a win in Missouri's deep-red 3rd District, where state Sen. Bob Onder won the Republican primary to replace retiring GOP Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer.\n\nThe primary has attracted millions of dollars in outside spending. The conservative Club for Growth Action has backed Onder, while two establishment groups active in other GOP primaries , Conservatives for American Excellence and America Leads Action Inc., have launched ads attacking him.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe won the GOP primary for governor in his state, the AP projects. Trump had hedged his bets in the race, endorsing Kehoe and two of the other top contenders, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nKehoe will face Democratic state Rep. Crystal Quade in November, but Republicans are expected to retain control of the Governor's Mansion.\n\nBridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

LOUIS - Democratic Rep. Cori Bush greeted volunteers and supporters two days before Tuesday's primary election with a buoyant chant: \"I believe that we will win!\"\n\nBush is known as a fighter; it's how she went from being an unhoused single mom protesting on the streets of Ferguson to becoming a prominent member of the so-called squad of progressive House members in Washington. But now, the activist-turned-politician is fighting to avoid losing a primary against a well-funded challenger - four years after she came to Washington by defeating the then-incumbent in a primary.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sense of why so much money would be spent in our congressional race when our district has so many needs,\" an exasperated Bush told NBC News in an interview on a sweltering summer day.\n\nShe was referring to the more than $18 million spent in her race against Wesley Bell, making it the second most expensive House primary in the nation. Bell, who is St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney, has had significantly more ad backup in the race thanks to a nearly $9 million infusion from a pro-Israel group seeking to oust Bush, an outspoken Israel critic.\n\nBell has consistently maintained that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas and said he would be supportive of the U.S. ally if elected. There are other issues in the race, including a Justice Department investigation into Bush's use of campaign money (Bush has said she's cooperating with the investigation and denies using funds improperly). But Israel - and the ads pouring in to contest the issue - has become a central part of another campaign just five weeks after Bush watched a fellow \"squad\" member, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, lose a New York primary that largely centered around Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nReflecting on the most difficult race of her political career, Bush compared her experience to that of Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that some in the party doubted her ascension as the Democratic presidential candidate after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\n\"People were like, 'No, we need to look for another person'. But she's been right there this whole time,\" Bush said. \"We are not, as a country, going to just step over the leadership of a Black woman. Or any woman ... and for me, it felt like a direct attack, because that is what I feel is happening to me right now.\"\n\n\"It was 52 years where two Black men held the seat. I've been in the seat three years, and it's enough?\" Bush said. \"It'd be different if I wasn't delivering dollars to the district.\"\n\nBush and Bell, both self-described progressives, have similar positions on most issues: They both believe in lowering health care costs, making the community safer and enacting policies that aim to help the working class. Abortion rights, on the ballot in Missouri, have also been central to both campaigns.\n\nBush acknowledged the similarities but argued that she has been more \"in step with the community\" she represents in Washington, including introducing a resolution for a cease-fire in Gaza that mirrored one backed by the progressive mayor of St. Louis city, a blue dot in a ruby-red state.\n\nA vocal critic of Israel's government, Bush has rallied against funding for the Jewish state in protest over its military campaign in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Bush accused Israel of an \"ethnic cleansing campaign\" as the country retaliated.\n\nAlong with other Democrats, Bush snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress this month. She supported college campus protests and brought a Palestinian student to Biden's State of the Union address in March while publicly opposing the administration's policies of supporting Israel.\n\nIn one of her first votes as a member of Congress in 2021, Bush joined eight colleagues in opposing $1 billion in funding for Israel's \"Iron Dome,\" its short-range missile defense system. She blasted Israel as an \"apartheid state\" and called for additional resources for Palestine instead.\n\nSome Jewish community leaders have condemned Bush's positions. A group of 30 rabbis from the area endorsed Bell in the spring and accused Bush of antisemitism.\n\nBush doubled down on her rhetoric. \"Do I regret trying to work to save the lives of those 40,000 Palestinians who are now gone? No, I don't regret that,\" Bush said. \"Because I fight against antisemitism and Islamophobia. I fight against all forms of hatred.\"\n\nBell took notice of Bush's positions - and the resulting fractures in the community, where at least 60,000 Jews lived as of 2015, according to the Jewish Federation of St. Louis.\n\nBell abandoned his long-shot bid against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley last year and instead mounted an aggressive campaign against Bush, whom he once vowed not to challenge, according to leaked audio obtained by NBC affiliate KSDK and verified by both Bell and Bush.\n\n\"Ironically, the Senate race is what opened my eyes to the needs of this particular district,\" Bell told NBC News during a gathering at a downtown restaurant. \"And then the straw that broke the camel's back for me was when I met with folks on the ground in D.C., and the recurring theme of not only is your congresswoman not working with folks, but it's hurting your district.\"\n\nBell has also put a magnifying glass on Bush's campaign spending, highlighting the probe into her campaign's hiring of Bush's romantic partner to provide security services. Bush confirmed the federal investigation but referred to the complaints as \"baseless.\"\n\nBoth Bush and Bell argued that the race is about more than just the Middle East.\n\nBush, a registered nurse, touted endorsements from local labor and union leaders as well as reproductive rights organizations, while Bell defended his record as a prosecutor who pledged criminal justice reform to a community that has had a difficult relationship with police.\n\nBush and Bell's political careers were both launched following days of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer shot and killed a Black teenager, Mike Brown, in 2014. Bush gained notice as a Black Lives Matter activist, and Bell won a race for city council in Ferguson and later unseated a longtime incumbent to become a Black prosecutor championing police reform.\n\nThe candidates have traded insults in advertisements blanketing the airwaves, including one ad from Bush featuring Michael Brown Sr., who railed against Bell for not bringing charges against the police officer who shot and killed his son. (Bell said the decision was \"one of the most difficult things\" he has had to do.)\n\nBell, meanwhile, spent a majority of his remarks before a supportive crowd on Sunday defending his record. \"We got community policing, we got court reforms, we got body cameras for every single officer in our district, and we did that by figuring out ways to work together,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. Katherine Clark, a member of House Democratic leadership, traveled to Missouri to stump for Bush. She told supporters that Bush is involved with the party's caucus in Washington and works not only with other Democrats but across the aisle, hoping to soften the blow of Bell's attack against her - most notably that Bush voted against Biden's signature Infrastructure law because it omitted more progressive policies.\n\nIt's the kind of ground support that Bowman lacked in his New York primary, though he too was endorsed by leadership, which traditionally backs incumbents.\n\nBell closed out his event by telling the intimate gathering he's \"feeling good\" about winning Tuesday's election.\n\nBush is in a similar mindset.\n\n\"We will win,\" she said in response to a question about a potential loss. \"But I won't stop just because of a title change. I'm not there for the title, I'm there for the benefit to the community.\"\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Cori Bush campaign's use of security funds\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - The Justice Department is investigating Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., for her campaign's spending on security services, she confirmed in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"We are fully cooperating in this investigation,\" Bush said, denying any wrongdoing.\n\nAs a former Black Lives Matter organizer and high-profile progressive on Capitol Hill, Bush has faced what she called \"relentless threats to my physical safety and life\" since her election in 2020.\n\n\"As a rank-and-file member of Congress I am not entitled to personal protection by the House, and instead have used campaign funds as permissible to retain security services,\" Bush said in her statement. \"I have not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services. Any reporting that I have used federal funds for personal security is simply false.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe Justice Department recently issued a grand jury subpoena to the House sergeant at arms for documents, a development that was made public on the House floor Monday. But the focus of the federal probe was not revealed at the time.\n\nTwo sources confirmed Monday night that the Justice Department was i nvestig a ting a Democratic lawmaker's use of security funds , but the member remained unidentified. Punchbowl News first reported Tuesday that Bush, who represents St. Louis, is the Democrat under investigation.\n\nBush, who ousted longtime Rep. Lacy Clay in the 2020 Democratic primary, came under scrutiny last February when she married her security guard, Cortney Merritts, then kept him on her campaign payroll for providing security services, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch .\n\nConservative watchdog groups filed at least two complaints against Bush with the Federal Election Commission. While federal law bars lawmakers from paying family members to work in their official offices, they are allowed to pay relatives for campaign work so long as \"the family member is providing bona fide services to the campaign.\" However, payments \"in excess of fair market value\" are prohibited, the law says.\n\nBush acknowledged in her statement Tuesday that she retained her husband as part of her security team, saying \"he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate.\"\n\nAn NBC News review of Bush's campaign expenditures found that she has spent $756,748.42 on security since her first run for Congress in the 2018 cycle.\n\nShe accused \"right-wing\" opponents of lodging \"baseless complaints against me\" and noted that the independent Office of Congressional Ethics had investigated the matter and unanimously voted to dismiss it. However, the bipartisan House Ethics Committee has not closed the case.\n\n\"I am under no illusion that these right-wing organizations will stop politicizing and pursuing efforts to attack me and the work that the people of St. Louis sent me to Congress to do: to lead boldly, to legislate change my constituents can feel, and to save lives,\" Bush said.\n\nThe clerk publicly informed lawmakers of the subpoena request when the House opened its session Monday, but few details were provided.\n\n\"This is to notify you formally pursuant to rule 8 of the rules of the House of Representatives that the office of the sergeant at arms for the House of Representatives has been served with a grand jury subpoena for documents issued by the U.S. Department of Justice,\" House Reading Clerk Susan Cole said, reading a notification from House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland.\n\n\"After consulting with the House General Counsel I have determined that compliance with the subpoena is consistent with the rights and privileges of the House,\" McFarland's statement, read by Cole, continued.\n\nA spokesperson for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Bush is \"entitled to the presumption of innocence.\"\n\n\"Representative Cori Bush has indicated that she is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice in connection with the ongoing investigation,\" said Jeffries spokesperson Christie Stephenson, who added that they expected the investigation would \"follow the facts, apply the law and be conducted in a professional manner.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Republican leaders in the House declined to comment.\n\nAsked about Bush at a leadership news conference, House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said Tuesday he had no comment and said it was \"something for the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"I haven't talked to her,\" Aguilar said.\n\nRebecca is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the House.\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Tennessee Children Were Illegally Jailed. Now Members of Congress Are Asking For an Investigation.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Nashville Public Radio . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nEleven members of Congress sent a letter Wednesday asking the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation into the juvenile justice system in Rutherford County, Tennessee, based on reporting published this month by ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio.\n\nThe letter, sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland, says , \"Tennessee's children deserve to enjoy their childhoods without the fear of being unjustly searched, detained, charged, and imprisoned.\" The letter's signers, all Democrats, include Reps. Steve Cohen, from Memphis; Val Demings, from Florida; Cori Bush, from Missouri; and Ted Lieu, from California. Cohen is on the House Judiciary Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\n\nThe ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio story detailed how Rutherford County's juvenile justice system had for years illegally arrested and detained children. A federal judge ordered the county to stop using an illegal detention policy in 2017. In June of this year, the county agreed to pay up to $11 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by kids who alleged that they had been illegally arrested or jailed.\n\nIn 2014, the last year for which Tennessee published an annual statistical report on how many kids were jailed in cases referred to juvenile court, Rutherford County detained nearly 10 times the state average. The system is overseen by Donna Scott Davenport, the only elected juvenile court judge the county has ever had.\n\nThe investigation chronicled how the judicial commissioners' office in Rutherford County approved a charge, \"criminal responsibility for conduct of another,\" to use against 10 children who had been accused of witnessing other kids in a fight and not stopping it. There is, in fact, no such charge. Rutherford County does not require judicial commissioners to have law degrees, and the two commissioners who were involved in that case are not lawyers.\n\nThe letter to Garland asks the Justice Department to investigate the role of judicial commissioners, as well as gaps in statewide data on the work of juvenile courts. \"Without data, we do not know whether similar abuses to those perpetuated by Rutherford County are occurring in the state's 97 other juvenile courts,\" the letter said.\n\nWe emailed a request for comment to Ashley McDonald, a Rutherford County spokesperson who has also been handling interview requests for Davenport, this afternoon, but did not receive an immediate response. For an earlier story she released a statement from the county's mayor, Bill Ketron, in which he said, \"I share our community's concerns over a news story that was recently released involving Rutherford County's juvenile justice system.\" A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that the agency received the letter and is reviewing the request, but declined to comment further.\n\nLast week, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee's office called for a review of Davenport. \"We are concerned about the recent reports and believe the appropriate judicial authorities should issue a full review,\" the governor's press secretary wrote in an email.\n\nFour days after the story was published by ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio, the president of Middle Tennessee State University notified faculty and staff that Davenport \" is no longer affiliated with the University .\" Davenport had taught juvenile justice for many years at the school, which is based in Murfreesboro, the seat of Rutherford County.\n\nThis weekend, Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama, told MSNBC that the operation of Rutherford County's juvenile justice system \"just boggles the mind.\"\n\nJoe Walsh, a former U.S. representative from Illinois, tweeted : \"I'm white. I'm conservative. But it's shit like this that has helped convince me that systemic racism is real.\" He exhorted people to read a thread about Rutherford County's juvenile justice system, calling it \"fucking disturbing.\"\n\nIn Tennessee, several lawmakers expressed outrage. State Sen. Jeff Yarbro tweeted , \"This is so wrong on so many levels,\" and called the juvenile detention practices of Rutherford County a \"nightmare.\" State Sen. Brenda Gilmore also called the happenings in Rutherford County a \"nightmare,\" saying , in a tweet, \"This is a mess and we must do far better.\" Meanwhile, Gloria Johnson, a state representative, tweeted , \"Our Democratic caucus will work to make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIn addition to the request from members of Congress, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund has also called for a federal civil rights investigation into Rutherford County's juvenile justice system.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, the Department of Justice retreated from civil rights investigations , seeing them as a form of federal overreach. In 2018, when ProPublica and the South Bend Tribune reported on police misconduct in Elkhart, Indiana , Elkhart's mayor even asked the Justice Department to investigate; the department never opened a probe.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department has been more likely to use its power to rein in abuses by local law enforcement. Since April, the department has opened at least five civil rights investigations, into the police departments in Minneapolis , Louisville and Phoenix and into conditions in Georgia's prisons and in five juvenile detention facilities in Texas .\n\nEditing by Emily Siner of WPLN News and Sarah Blustain of ProPublica.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Appeared in a Super PAC Ad Asking for Money. That Might Break the Rules.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nNot long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials.\n\nThe ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts.\n\nGreene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene's campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racist remarks .\n\nIn December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia's two Senate runoffs. \"It's time to fight back now before it's too late,\" Greene said in one of the videos .\n\nImmediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to \"make a contribution today.\"\n\nStop Socialism Now PAC's Ad\n\nUnder federal law , candidates and elected officials cannot \"solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election ... unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements\" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren't subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines \"solicit\" as \"to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,\" that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including \"the conduct of persons involved in the communication.\"\n\nLegal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene's appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks.\n\nPaul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line.\n\n\"This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,\" Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, \"becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this.\"\n\nRyan said he's never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC's script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend.\n\nPolitical operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC's blessing . Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use - in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage .\n\nThe Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC.\n\n\"Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can't solicit - that is clear and indisputable,\" said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \"The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they're allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart.\"\n\nThe Greene ad doesn't specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue.\n\n\"My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,\" said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can't do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations.\n\nStill, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn't appear on the super PAC's online donations page, he said.\n\n\"The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene's name or likeness,\" Baran said in an email.\n\nThe Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn't respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, \"I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write.\"\n\nGreene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection.\n\nIn February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders . Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with \"a bullet to the head.\"\n\nThose incidents predate Greene's election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff \"berated\" and \"threatened\" her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists.\n\nIt is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for \"digital and television advertising\" against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn't show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThe super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on Dec. 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn't one of the super PAC's paid posts that show up in the social network's voluntary disclosures of political ads .\n\nFEC disclosures don't connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs.\n\nCynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene's district, gave $125,000 on Nov. 13. Her husband, Frederick \"Chip\" Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn't vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on Dec. 9. He declined to comment.\n\nGreene's extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan's firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000.\n\nShaftan's ads for Greene's official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, \"The socialist left won't stop until America is destroyed.\" In another ad , Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled \"gun control\" and \"socialism.\"\n\nShaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene's. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence.\n\n\"Once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself - the only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,\" Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones . \"This is it. Nov. 3, freedom is on the ballot.\"\n\nGreene planned to speak at a May 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Chris Dorr, who told followers they could openly carry guns there. On the eve of the rally, the organizers called it off. Greene released a statement claiming state authorities refused to provide security for her.\n\nAn Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman disputed that account, saying the police \"had every intention of providing security\" and had \"all necessary measures in place.\"\n\nChris Dorr didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2019, Ohio authorities investigated and decided against prosecuting him for threatening assassinations in response to the Republican governor's proposed gun regulations. \"There could be political bodies lying all over the ground,\" Dorr said in an online video. \"We gun owners will pull the trigger and leave the corpse for the buzzards.\"\n\nRead More\n\nGreene also touted the Dorr brothers' American Firearms Association's endorsement of a bill she introduced in Congress to block federal funding for any gun regulations. An article on the far-right website Breitbart said Greene's bill was a response to an abandoned effort late last year by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to restrict equipment that makes it possible to use pistols like assault weapons. This type of weapon was later used in the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting in March.\n\nIn April, Greene's campaign said it would raffle off a version of the weapon. \"I'm giving away the gun that triggers the Fake News Media,\" Greene said in an email to supporters.\n\nHelp ProPublica Find the Most Important Stories of 2021\n\nThere's an insurrection, a pandemic and a new administration.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nElection coverage often focuses on competition between rival candidates while downplaying policies and platforms. But knowing how to decipher these \"horse race\" stories can help you understand what's at stake for you and can inform your political participation.\n\nThink about it this way: The campaigns themselves are constantly watching certain signals - polls, fundraising totals, public opinion - to understand what's going on in their races. They adjust their tactics accordingly. You have the power to adjust your actions, too. Here are a few questions to ask.\n\nToday, we're going to focus on your district's candidates for the House of Representatives using a tool called the Cook Political Report.\n\nThe Cook Political Report is a nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes federal campaigns and elections to weigh the likelihood that your current representative will be able to hang onto their seat compared to the chances of a challenger defeating them. Its authors watch polls, track fundraising and outside spending, and talk to the campaigns and candidates. Then they assign a rating to the competitiveness of each race:\n\nThese ratings update often, though, based on what's happening on the campaign trail. Want to know if the outlook in your district changes? You can check the Cook Political Report site .\n\nPolitical organizations and nonprofit committees have spent hundreds of millions of dollars influencing elections, so candidates' campaign finances are another illuminating metric. Where did they get all that money, and how are they spending it?\n\nOne number that can help you determine the strength of a campaign is the percentage of funds raised from PACs , or political action committees. A PAC is a collection of individuals who have pooled their money to donate to candidates. The best-funded PACs are corporations and interest groups - the NRA, Planned Parenthood and labor unions all have PACs - but they can also be funded by civically engaged folks who aren't political operators.\n\nA reliance on PACs, versus individual donors, can tell you something about how much the candidate is benefitting from institutional support versus grassroots support . A higher percentage of funds from PACs means a candidate's donor money comes mostly in fairly large checks, as opposed to donations from individuals. A higher percentage of individual donations, on the other hand, is a sign of grassroots enthusiasm about the campaign.\n\nFederal candidates have to file data about their fundraising and spending with the Federal Election Commission, the agency that enforces campaign finance law, on a regular schedule. This makes it easier to peek inside this universe.\n\nMost campaigns file quarterly reports on April 15, July 15, Oct. 15 and Jan. 15. So the numbers here will give you a snapshot of money raised and spent within a three-month window. To start, we'll look specifically at campaign fundraising .\n\nCampaigns need money to get their messages out; it's expensive to buy advertising and organize rallies, town halls and other campaign activities. Most political fundraising amounts sound like a LOT of money to me - and probably to you, too. For example, according to OpenSecrets, hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into Pennsylvania's senate race so far . So how do you know what those numbers mean?\n\nThat's where the rankings come in handy: More competitive races typically attract more money. You can also look at the money gap between two candidates. If a candidate is at the lower end of the fundraising scale, particularly against a well-funded competitor, that usually indicates their chances are not great. But there are exceptions. In 2018, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in her primary despite a huge gap in fundraising. In 2020, Rep. Cori Bush defeated the 20-year (and highly funded) incumbent congressman William Lacy Clay in a major upset. So if your candidate of choice is outspent, don't count them out.\n\nThere's only so much that ProPublica can track with our data on federal candidates, but the League of Women Voters has a trove of information about candidates all the way down your ballot. The league is nonpartisan and works to arm citizens with the information they need to confidently vote.\n\nFor its VOTE411.org project, the league reached out to every candidate running for local and state office and asked each one a set of identical questions, like:\n\nRead More\n\nUsually, the majority of candidates actually answer these questions in their own words because the league is such a well-known and respected resource for voters. This year, though, more and more Republican candidates are refusing to participate in league activities because they claim it is biased against Republicans, as our reporter Megan O'Matz reported early this election season .

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Appeared in a Super PAC Ad Asking for Money. That Might Break the Rules.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nNot long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials.\n\nThe ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts.\n\nGreene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene's campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racist remarks .\n\nIn December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia's two Senate runoffs. \"It's time to fight back now before it's too late,\" Greene said in one of the videos .\n\nImmediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to \"make a contribution today.\"\n\nStop Socialism Now PAC's Ad\n\nUnder federal law , candidates and elected officials cannot \"solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election ... unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements\" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren't subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines \"solicit\" as \"to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,\" that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including \"the conduct of persons involved in the communication.\"\n\nLegal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene's appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks.\n\nPaul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line.\n\n\"This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,\" Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, \"becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this.\"\n\nRyan said he's never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC's script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend.\n\nPolitical operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC's blessing . Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use - in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage .\n\nThe Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC.\n\n\"Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can't solicit - that is clear and indisputable,\" said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \"The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they're allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart.\"\n\nThe Greene ad doesn't specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue.\n\n\"My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,\" said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can't do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations.\n\nStill, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn't appear on the super PAC's online donations page, he said.\n\n\"The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene's name or likeness,\" Baran said in an email.\n\nThe Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn't respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, \"I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write.\"\n\nGreene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection.\n\nIn February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders . Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with \"a bullet to the head.\"\n\nThose incidents predate Greene's election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff \"berated\" and \"threatened\" her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists.\n\nIt is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for \"digital and television advertising\" against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn't show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThe super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on Dec. 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn't one of the super PAC's paid posts that show up in the social network's voluntary disclosures of political ads .\n\nFEC disclosures don't connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs.\n\nCynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene's district, gave $125,000 on Nov. 13. Her husband, Frederick \"Chip\" Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn't vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on Dec. 9. He declined to comment.\n\nGreene's extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan's firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000.\n\nShaftan's ads for Greene's official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, \"The socialist left won't stop until America is destroyed.\" In another ad , Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled \"gun control\" and \"socialism.\"\n\nShaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene's. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence.\n\n\"Once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself - the only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,\" Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones . \"This is it. Nov. 3, freedom is on the ballot.\"\n\nGreene planned to speak at a May 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Chris Dorr, who told followers they could openly carry guns there. On the eve of the rally, the organizers called it off. Greene released a statement claiming state authorities refused to provide security for her.\n\nAn Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman disputed that account, saying the police \"had every intention of providing security\" and had \"all necessary measures in place.\"\n\nChris Dorr didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2019, Ohio authorities investigated and decided against prosecuting him for threatening assassinations in response to the Republican governor's proposed gun regulations. \"There could be political bodies lying all over the ground,\" Dorr said in an online video. \"We gun owners will pull the trigger and leave the corpse for the buzzards.\"\n\nRead More\n\nGreene also touted the Dorr brothers' American Firearms Association's endorsement of a bill she introduced in Congress to block federal funding for any gun regulations.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Appeared in a Super PAC Ad Asking for Money. That Might Break the Rules.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nNot long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials.\n\nThe ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts.\n\nGreene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene's campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racist remarks .\n\nIn December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia's two Senate runoffs. \"It's time to fight back now before it's too late,\" Greene said in one of the videos .\n\nImmediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to \"make a contribution today.\"\n\nStop Socialism Now PAC's Ad\n\nUnder federal law , candidates and elected officials cannot \"solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election ... unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements\" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren't subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines \"solicit\" as \"to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,\" that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including \"the conduct of persons involved in the communication.\"\n\nLegal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene's appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks.\n\nPaul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line.\n\n\"This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,\" Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, \"becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this.\"\n\nRyan said he's never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC's script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend.\n\nPolitical operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC's blessing . Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use - in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage .\n\nThe Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC.\n\n\"Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can't solicit - that is clear and indisputable,\" said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \"The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they're allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart.\"\n\nThe Greene ad doesn't specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue.\n\n\"My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,\" said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can't do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations.\n\nStill, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn't appear on the super PAC's online donations page, he said.\n\n\"The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene's name or likeness,\" Baran said in an email.\n\nThe Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn't respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, \"I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write.\"\n\nGreene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection.\n\nIn February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders . Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with \"a bullet to the head.\"\n\nThose incidents predate Greene's election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff \"berated\" and \"threatened\" her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists.\n\nIt is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for \"digital and television advertising\" against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn't show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThe super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on Dec. 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn't one of the super PAC's paid posts that show up in the social network's voluntary disclosures of political ads .\n\nFEC disclosures don't connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs.\n\nCynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene's district, gave $125,000 on Nov. 13. Her husband, Frederick \"Chip\" Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn't vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on Dec. 9. He declined to comment.\n\nGreene's extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan's firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000.\n\nShaftan's ads for Greene's official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, \"The socialist left won't stop until America is destroyed.\" In another ad , Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled \"gun control\" and \"socialism.\"\n\nShaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene's. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence.\n\n\"Once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself - the only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,\" Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones . \"This is it.

      "text": "Tennessee Children Were Illegally Jailed. Now Members of Congress Are Asking For an Investigation.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Nashville Public Radio . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nEleven members of Congress sent a letter Wednesday asking the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation into the juvenile justice system in Rutherford County, Tennessee, based on reporting published this month by ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio.\n\nThe letter, sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland, says , \"Tennessee's children deserve to enjoy their childhoods without the fear of being unjustly searched, detained, charged, and imprisoned.\" The letter's signers, all Democrats, include Reps. Steve Cohen, from Memphis; Val Demings, from Florida; Cori Bush, from Missouri; and Ted Lieu, from California. Cohen is on the House Judiciary Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\n\nThe ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio story detailed how Rutherford County's juvenile justice system had for years illegally arrested and detained children. A federal judge ordered the county to stop using an illegal detention policy in 2017. In June of this year, the county agreed to pay up to $11 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by kids who alleged that they had been illegally arrested or jailed.\n\nIn 2014, the last year for which Tennessee published an annual statistical report on how many kids were jailed in cases referred to juvenile court, Rutherford County detained nearly 10 times the state average. The system is overseen by Donna Scott Davenport, the only elected juvenile court judge the county has ever had.\n\nThe investigation chronicled how the judicial commissioners' office in Rutherford County approved a charge, \"criminal responsibility for conduct of another,\" to use against 10 children who had been accused of witnessing other kids in a fight and not stopping it. There is, in fact, no such charge. Rutherford County does not require judicial commissioners to have law degrees, and the two commissioners who were involved in that case are not lawyers.\n\nThe letter to Garland asks the Justice Department to investigate the role of judicial commissioners, as well as gaps in statewide data on the work of juvenile courts. \"Without data, we do not know whether similar abuses to those perpetuated by Rutherford County are occurring in the state's 97 other juvenile courts,\" the letter said.\n\nWe emailed a request for comment to Ashley McDonald, a Rutherford County spokesperson who has also been handling interview requests for Davenport, this afternoon, but did not receive an immediate response. For an earlier story she released a statement from the county's mayor, Bill Ketron, in which he said, \"I share our community's concerns over a news story that was recently released involving Rutherford County's juvenile justice system.\" A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that the agency received the letter and is reviewing the request, but declined to comment further.\n\nLast week, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee's office called for a review of Davenport. \"We are concerned about the recent reports and believe the appropriate judicial authorities should issue a full review,\" the governor's press secretary wrote in an email.\n\nFour days after the story was published by ProPublica and Nashville Public Radio, the president of Middle Tennessee State University notified faculty and staff that Davenport \" is no longer affiliated with the University .\" Davenport had taught juvenile justice for many years at the school, which is based in Murfreesboro, the seat of Rutherford County.\n\nThis weekend, Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama, told MSNBC that the operation of Rutherford County's juvenile justice system \"just boggles the mind.\"\n\nJoe Walsh, a former U.S. representative from Illinois, tweeted : \"I'm white. I'm conservative. But it's shit like this that has helped convince me that systemic racism is real.\" He exhorted people to read a thread about Rutherford County's juvenile justice system, calling it \"fucking disturbing.\"\n\nIn Tennessee, several lawmakers expressed outrage. State Sen. Jeff Yarbro tweeted , \"This is so wrong on so many levels,\" and called the juvenile detention practices of Rutherford County a \"nightmare.\" State Sen. Brenda Gilmore also called the happenings in Rutherford County a \"nightmare,\" saying , in a tweet, \"This is a mess and we must do far better.\" Meanwhile, Gloria Johnson, a state representative, tweeted , \"Our Democratic caucus will work to make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIn addition to the request from members of Congress, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund has also called for a federal civil rights investigation into Rutherford County's juvenile justice system.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, the Department of Justice retreated from civil rights investigations , seeing them as a form of federal overreach. In 2018, when ProPublica and the South Bend Tribune reported on police misconduct in Elkhart, Indiana , Elkhart's mayor even asked the Justice Department to investigate; the department never opened a probe.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department has been more likely to use its power to rein in abuses by local law enforcement. Since April, the department has opened at least five civil rights investigations, into the police departments in Minneapolis , Louisville and Phoenix and into conditions in Georgia's prisons and in five juvenile detention facilities in Texas .\n\nEditing by Emily Siner of WPLN News and Sarah Blustain of ProPublica.

      "text": "How to Follow Your Congressional and Local Elections in 2022\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nElection coverage often focuses on competition between rival candidates while downplaying policies and platforms. But knowing how to decipher these \"horse race\" stories can help you understand what's at stake for you and can inform your political participation.\n\nThink about it this way: The campaigns themselves are constantly watching certain signals - polls, fundraising totals, public opinion - to understand what's going on in their races. They adjust their tactics accordingly. You have the power to adjust your actions, too. Here are a few questions to ask.\n\nToday, we're going to focus on your district's candidates for the House of Representatives using a tool called the Cook Political Report.\n\nThe Cook Political Report is a nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes federal campaigns and elections to weigh the likelihood that your current representative will be able to hang onto their seat compared to the chances of a challenger defeating them. Its authors watch polls, track fundraising and outside spending, and talk to the campaigns and candidates. Then they assign a rating to the competitiveness of each race:\n\nThese ratings update often, though, based on what's happening on the campaign trail. Want to know if the outlook in your district changes? You can check the Cook Political Report site .\n\nPolitical organizations and nonprofit committees have spent hundreds of millions of dollars influencing elections, so candidates' campaign finances are another illuminating metric. Where did they get all that money, and how are they spending it?\n\nOne number that can help you determine the strength of a campaign is the percentage of funds raised from PACs , or political action committees. A PAC is a collection of individuals who have pooled their money to donate to candidates. The best-funded PACs are corporations and interest groups - the NRA, Planned Parenthood and labor unions all have PACs - but they can also be funded by civically engaged folks who aren't political operators.\n\nA reliance on PACs, versus individual donors, can tell you something about how much the candidate is benefitting from institutional support versus grassroots support . A higher percentage of funds from PACs means a candidate's donor money comes mostly in fairly large checks, as opposed to donations from individuals. A higher percentage of individual donations, on the other hand, is a sign of grassroots enthusiasm about the campaign.\n\nFederal candidates have to file data about their fundraising and spending with the Federal Election Commission, the agency that enforces campaign finance law, on a regular schedule. This makes it easier to peek inside this universe.\n\nMost campaigns file quarterly reports on April 15, July 15, Oct. 15 and Jan. 15. So the numbers here will give you a snapshot of money raised and spent within a three-month window. To start, we'll look specifically at campaign fundraising .\n\nCampaigns need money to get their messages out; it's expensive to buy advertising and organize rallies, town halls and other campaign activities. Most political fundraising amounts sound like a LOT of money to me - and probably to you, too. For example, according to OpenSecrets, hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into Pennsylvania's senate race so far . So how do you know what those numbers mean?\n\nThat's where the rankings come in handy: More competitive races typically attract more money. You can also look at the money gap between two candidates. If a candidate is at the lower end of the fundraising scale, particularly against a well-funded competitor, that usually indicates their chances are not great. But there are exceptions. In 2018, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in her primary despite a huge gap in fundraising. In 2020, Rep. Cori Bush defeated the 20-year (and highly funded) incumbent congressman William Lacy Clay in a major upset. So if your candidate of choice is outspent, don't count them out.\n\nThere's only so much that ProPublica can track with our data on federal candidates, but the League of Women Voters has a trove of information about candidates all the way down your ballot. The league is nonpartisan and works to arm citizens with the information they need to confidently vote.\n\nFor its VOTE411.org project, the league reached out to every candidate running for local and state office and asked each one a set of identical questions, like:\n\nRead More\n\nUsually, the majority of candidates actually answer these questions in their own words because the league is such a well-known and respected resource for voters. This year, though, more and more Republican candidates are refusing to participate in league activities because they claim it is biased against Republicans, as our reporter Megan O'Matz reported early this election season . That said, the Vote411 voter guides can still help you learn about candidates and their positions, as well as any ballot measures in your area.\n\nAnother resource, Ballotpedia , also has a tool to help you understand what you're voting for, especially on the local level. Put in your address and get information on every candidate and ballot initiative you'll have a say on at the polls.\n\nFiled under -\n\nKarim Doumar was the Deputy Newsletter Editor with ProPublica.\n\nCynthia Gordy Giwa was ProPublica's marketing director.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Appeared in a Super PAC Ad Asking for Money. That Might Break the Rules.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nNot long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials.\n\nThe ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts.\n\nGreene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene's campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racist remarks .\n\nIn December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia's two Senate runoffs. \"It's time to fight back now before it's too late,\" Greene said in one of the videos .\n\nImmediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to \"make a contribution today.\"\n\nStop Socialism Now PAC's Ad\n\nUnder federal law , candidates and elected officials cannot \"solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election ... unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements\" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren't subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines \"solicit\" as \"to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,\" that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including \"the conduct of persons involved in the communication.\"\n\nLegal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene's appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks.\n\nPaul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line.\n\n\"This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,\" Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, \"becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this.\"\n\nRyan said he's never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC's script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend.\n\nPolitical operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC's blessing . Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use - in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage .\n\nThe Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC.\n\n\"Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can't solicit - that is clear and indisputable,\" said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \"The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they're allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart.\"\n\nThe Greene ad doesn't specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue.\n\n\"My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,\" said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can't do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations.\n\nStill, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn't appear on the super PAC's online donations page, he said.\n\n\"The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene's name or likeness,\" Baran said in an email.\n\nThe Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn't respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, \"I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write.\"\n\nGreene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection.\n\nIn February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders . Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with \"a bullet to the head.\"\n\nThose incidents predate Greene's election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff \"berated\" and \"threatened\" her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists.\n\nIt is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for \"digital and television advertising\" against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn't show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThe super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on Dec. 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn't one of the super PAC's paid posts that show up in the social network's voluntary disclosures of political ads .\n\nFEC disclosures don't connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs.\n\nCynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene's district, gave $125,000 on Nov. 13. Her husband, Frederick \"Chip\" Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn't vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on Dec. 9. He declined to comment.\n\nGreene's extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan's firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000.\n\nShaftan's ads for Greene's official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, \"The socialist left won't stop until America is destroyed.\" In another ad , Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled \"gun control\" and \"socialism.\"\n\nShaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene's. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence.\n\n\"Once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself - the only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,\" Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones . \"This is it. Nov. 3, freedom is on the ballot.\"\n\nGreene planned to speak at a May 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Chris Dorr, who told followers they could openly carry guns there. On the eve of the rally, the organizers called it off. Greene released a statement claiming state authorities refused to provide security for her.\n\nAn Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman disputed that account, saying the police \"had every intention of providing security\" and had \"all necessary measures in place.\"\n\nChris Dorr didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2019, Ohio authorities investigated and decided against prosecuting him for threatening assassinations in response to the Republican governor's proposed gun regulations. \"There could be political bodies lying all over the ground,\" Dorr said in an online video. \"We gun owners will pull the trigger and leave the corpse for the buzzards.\"\n\nRead More\n\nGreene also touted the Dorr brothers' American Firearms Association's endorsement of a bill she introduced in Congress to block federal funding for any gun regulations. An article on the far-right website Breitbart said Greene's bill was a response to an abandoned effort late last year by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to restrict equipment that makes it possible to use pistols like assault weapons. This type of weapon was later used in the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting in March.\n\nIn April, Greene's campaign said it would raffle off a version of the weapon. \"I'm giving away the gun that triggers the Fake News Media,\" Greene said in an email to supporters.\n\nHelp ProPublica Find the Most Important Stories of 2021\n\nThere's an insurrection, a pandemic and a new administration.

Un mayor porcentaje de fondos de los PAC significa que el dinero de los donantes de un candidato llega en su mayor parte en cheques bastante abultados, a diferencia de las donaciones de los individuos. Un mayor porcentaje de donaciones individuales, por otra parte, es un signo de entusiasmo de las bases sobre la campaña.\n\nLos candidatos federales tienen que reportar de manera sistemática datos sobre sus recaudaciones y gastos a la Comisión Federal Electoral, la agencia que hace cumplir la ley de financiación de las campañas. Eso facilita echar un vistazo dentro de ese mundo.\n\nLa mayoría de las campañas presentan informes trimestrales el 15 de abril, 15 de julio, 15 de octubre y 15 de enero. Para buscar detalles específicos de recaudación de fondos de la campaña por candidato o tipo de contienda, vea el Election Databot de ProPublica (en inglés).\n\nA primera vista, la mayoría de las recaudaciones políticas de fondos suenan como que manejan un MONTÓN de dinero. Entonces, ¿cómo sabe lo que significan esos números?\n\nAhí es donde la clasificación de los números es útil: las contiendas más competitivas suelen atraer más dinero. Las campañas necesitan fondos para difundir sus mensajes; es caro comprar publicidad y organizar mítines, reuniones públicas vía Zoom y otras actividades de campaña. Una contienda impredecible probablemente tiene dos candidatos que han recaudado más dinero que muchos otros candidatos en contiendas menos competitivas.\n\nTambién puede ver la brecha de dinero entre dos candidatos. Si uno se encuentra en el extremo inferior de la escala de recaudación de fondos, en particular frente a un competidor bien financiado, eso suele indicar que sus posibilidades de victoria no son altas. Sin embargo, hay excepciones, como la contienda primaria democráta de agosto del primer distrito del congreso de Missouri. En esta, el aspirante Cori Bush, una activista de Black Lives Matter, derrotó de manera sorpresiva a William Lacy Clay, miembro de la Cámara de Representantes postulado a reelección después de 20 años en el puesto (y altamente financiado).

      "text": "Q&A: The pro-Israel pollster behind Cori Bushâs primary loss\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nWhen she conceded her Democratic primary on Tuesday, Missouri Rep. Cori Bush put the blame on pro-Israel groups that dumped millions of dollars into St. Louis. âAIPAC, Iâm coming to tear your kingdom down,â she said, quoting an old spiritual â and within a day, was being condemned by the White House for saying it.\n\nDemocratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) was part of the coalition that beat Bush. Its chairman, Mark Mellman, produced hyper-accurate polling that showed Bush as vulnerable after she voted against a House resolution condemning Hamas and the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel; its final polling nailed the 5-point margin that St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell was about to win by.\n\nPending one recount in Arizona, where DMFI is hoping to get a more moderate Democrat past a progressive in a deep blue seat, itâs done with primaries this year. Most members of the Houseâs progressive âsquadâ will return to Congress, and DMFI isnât playing against Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar next week, as it expects her to win; âit didnât look like we would be able to have the kind of impact there that we would have in these other places,â said Mellman.\n\nAmericana: Why did you zero in on these two Democrats?\n\nMark Mellman: The hardest thing to do in politics is to defeat an incumbent member of the House. We donât want to waste peopleâs money by spending in places where we canât win. So, we were looking for two sides of an equation.\n\nOne: Whatâs the value of getting rid of them? We want to oppose people who wreak havoc with the Democratic agenda, and we want to defeat people who are anti-Israel. On both counts, these members were among the worst, among the most divisive, among the biggest opponents of key elements of the Biden-Harris agenda, the most bellicose, hostile, anti-Israel voices in the Congress. The value of getting rid of them was tremendous.\n\nThe second question is: Are we able to get rid of them? They looked vulnerable in our polling, because of their own mistakes, because of their own errors, because of their own divisiveness, but they were also vulnerable because they faced strong opponents.\n\nAmericana: There were nine House Democrats who voted against the initial resolution condemning Hamas. Did you look at primarying all of them?\n\nMark Mellman: We considered races against several divisive anti-Israel members. Rashida Tlaib had no opponent. Others had weaker opponents. When we first polled in Cori Bushâs district, she was 16 points ahead, but we looked carefully, and we saw the vulnerability.\n\nAmericana: It didnât look like the Israel issue came up in most paid messaging; it was about their votes against the infrastructure bill, whether they supported Biden. How much did the Israel question move voters?\n\nMark Mellman: Well, one of the things that people were disturbed by, in our research, was the divisive nature of their rhetoric. Their attacks on Israel served to reinforce that image of divisiveness. If they refused to condemn Hamas in some way, it contributed to that image.\n\nAmericana: Youâve been challenging these candidates for a few cycles, but this is the first time incumbents have lost. What changed?\n\nMark Mellman: DMFI PAC had not challenged these incumbents in the past. We did go after Congresswoman Marie Newman, a strident anti-Israel member, last cycle and helped defeat her. [Newman was forced into a new district by redistricting and lost to a fellow House Democrat.]\n\nBut I think weâre seeing a couple different things happen. There was a point in time when people were angry with Democrats for not standing up strongly enough to Trump. In the early days, in 2018 and 2020, some progressives took advantage of that viewpoint. Now, I think things have flipped. People are still strongly anti-Trump, make no mistake, but they want candidates who are going to bring people together and produce results theyâve seen. Theyâve seen Joe Biden and Kamala Harris demonstrate that. They donât want to just shout into the void. They want to get something done. And these divisive candidates are seen as shouting into the void and not getting things done.\n\nAmericana: What was your plan, at the start of the cycle?\n\nMark Mellman: We wanted to defeat at least one of the anti-Israel members, and we wanted to prevent that small group of strongly anti-Israel members from expanding. We exceeded those goals.\n\nAmericana: And whatâs your plan for 2026?\n\nMark Mellman: Well, weâve just started thinking about that. We understand that the people left on the board are harder to beat, and weâre going to have to do something. Weâre not just going to be able to come in in the closing weeks of a campaign and win â thatâs something we learned earlier on, something we applied to this cycle with Bush and Bowman.\n\nAmericana: Both Bowman and Bush said, after their loss, that theyâre going to continue challenging the influence of pro-Israel groups; Bush said she was coming to tear AIPACâs kingdom down. What do you expect from them now?\n\nMark Mellman: Honestly, I think theyâre going to find that being a former member of Congress is not a tremendous platform from which to influence the nationâs agenda.\n\nAmericana: There was a sort of split screen on Tuesday. Early in the day, you had people like Ari Fleischer saying that antisemitism was the reason Harris didnât pick Gov. Josh Shapiro as a running mate; hours later you had Bush losing, in large part because of the Israel question. Where does the work you did this cycle fit into what Republicans are saying?\n\nMark Mellman: Look, first of all, I think those charges are ridiculous. Kamala Harris has chosen Jewish men to play vitally important roles in both her professional and personal life, for a long time. To suggest that sheâs antisemitic is the height of absurdity. She had a lot of good choices for a VP, and she had to choose one.\n\nI look at the Democratic Party as basically a moderate center-left party, and I look at the Republicans as absolute extremists. The problem is the voters donât see it that way. The problem is voters look at the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and from their perspective, they see two equally extreme parties, and that is deeply problematic for the Democratic Party. What this year has shown is that the Democrats are rejecting their extremists, and Republicans are allowing them to take over their party. And that is a big difference. The Republicans are the party of extremism. The Democrats are not.\n\nAmericana: What is DMFI going to do, over the next 90 days, to press that case and elect Harris and Democrats?\n\nMark Mellman: We donât talk about exactly what weâre doing until we do it, because that just helps our opponents. But we have real credibility when we go to the pro-Israel community and say: You can trust these candidates. This is a pro-Israel presidential ticket. This is a party thatâs ridding itself of its anti-Israel extremists. This is a pro-Israel party that deserves support from pro-Israel Americans, and thatâs a message weâre going to be carrying around the country.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "âItâs disgustingâ: Progressives seethe after Mondaire Jones backs Jamaal Bowman challenger\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHouse progressives raged against former colleague Mondaire Jones after he endorsed Rep. Jamaal Bowmanâs primary opponent George Latimer.\n\nâI am appalled,â Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. said.\n\nIn backing Latimer, Jones accused Bowman in a New York Times interview of causing âpain and anxietyâ among his Jewish constituents with his rhetoric criticizing Israel. Democratic donors and groups supportive of Israel have poured millions into unseating Bowman this cycle. Jones, meanwhile, faces a competitive race to unseat Republican Rep. Mike Lawler.\n\nBoth Jones and Bowman were elected in 2020, when a new, diverse slate of left-leaning Democrats headlined by fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were ascendant in the House. Some of Bowmanâs allies on the left took the move against him personally.\n\nâItâs disgusting,â said Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., who also faces a well-funded primary challenge this cycle. âIs that who he wants to be? Someone that the members canât even trust? Someone that the members know will be your friend one day, and then as soon as itâs beneficial to him, will completely not only turn on you, but will go and support the person that is challenging you?â\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Penn. called the endorsement âincredibly disappointing.â\n\nâHere we have a former CPC and CBC member whoâs endorsing against both a Progressive and Black man who was the first Black man in his seat,â she said. âSo it couldnât be me. But I think and I hope that people will look at that for what that is.â\n\nReached for comment by Semafor, Jones said in a statement that he has âa longstanding relationship with Georgeâ and that he is âmaking this endorsement to stand up for my Jewish constituents because Rep. Bowman and I have deeply different views on Israel.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nJones is in a tough position. Turning on Bowman could bolster his campaign against Lawler, a moderate who is also backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, but at the risk of a break with his former Democratic colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. It would make for an especially awkward reunion in the House if Bowman and Jones both win their respective races.\n\nLawler scoffed when I asked him if heâd heard about the recent endorsement. He noted that Jones had previously said âwe need more people like Bowman in Congressâ in 2020. That quote has featured prominently in Lawlerâs campaign material, a sign of the pressure Jones is facing to distance himself from Bowman.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Americana\n\nAlso: A new book tracks Donald Trumpâs post-2020 exile.\n\nBehold: The normal presidential campaign! For the first time in eight years, Iâve just gotten back from a Democratic rally that featured both halves of the ticket with no COVID or masking requirements and a strong presumption they would actually be the nominees come November. It felt like a good moment â maybe the last moment â for a heat check on whatâs become a recognizable election, with two competing campaigns holding normal events and fighting minute-by-minute for the news cycle.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, Democrats wanted to talk about their crowds. Their voters were trudging a mile from mud-bound cars to see the newly completed presidential ticket . They were fainting in the heat as they stood through warm-up speeches and ran out of bottled water. They were pinning new lime green âbratâ buttons on their shirts and wearing fresh â Cat Ladies for Kamala â gear. They were chanting (âKA-MA-LAâ) over the protesters whoâd showed up to demand an arms embargo on Israel â protesters who used to get heard more clearly over the nervous is-he-okay quiet of Joe Bidenâs speeches.\n\nâI feel a lot better than I did in 2016 at this time,â said Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, gazing out at 15,000 people in a hangar of Detroitâs international airport on Wednesday. She was one of the few Democrats to warn that Hillary Clinton was vulnerable in the state in that election.\n\nâI donât know how I can explain it to you,â marveled Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 36 hours into his role as the Democratic candidate for vice president. âWalking into that arena in Philly, or that field out in Wisconsin, or right here â to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign.â\n\nThe presidential nominee delivered a drum-tight stump speech, which has differed so little from state to state that anti-Harris accounts on X have already spliced videos together to try to drum a scandal out of the repetition. In the hangar, for people hearing it for the first time, every line hit â denunciations of Donald Trump and Project 2025, the slogan that âweâre not going back,â a thank-you to Joe Biden, and promises to lower prices and help âbuild wealthâ for the working class.\n\nâUnderstand: In this fight, we are joyful warriors,â Harris said. âWe know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work.â The cheer was loud enough to set off decibel warnings on Apple watches, and she repeated the line: âHard work is good work.â\n\nFor David's view, keep reading... â\n\nFor David's view, keep reading... â\n\nJD Vance had a mission this week: Chase Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. In every city where they rallied, he showed up for a press conference, deriding the Democrats for not taking questions, ribbing the media for not demanding them. In Eau Claire, Wis., Vance and his entourage walked over to Air Force to (âI just wanted to check out my future planeâ) and said he felt sorry for the Harris traveling press. One day later, for the first time, that press pool got to throw questions at Harris from the tarmac.\n\nVanceâs biggest success: Elevating questions about Tim Walzâs retirement from the Army National Guard. On Tuesday, the Harris-Walz campaign shared a video of Walz talking to a crowd about limits on certain firearms, like the ones he âcarried in war.â In Eau Claire, Vance questioned the âstolen valor crapâ coming from the Democrat â Walz had deployed to Europe for Operation Enduring Freedom, but not seen combat in Afghanistan.\n\nâI think thatâs going to follow him around, because veterans, and I think non-veterans, are really pissed off that he claimed to do something that he didnât do,â he told Semaforâs Shelby Talcott in an interview from the campaign plane.\n\nFor Shelby Talcottâs exclusive interview with Vance, keep readingâ¦ â\n\nFor Shelby Talcottâs exclusive interview with Vance, keep readingâ¦ â\n\nABC News will host the first Trump-Harris debate on Sept. 10, after the GOP nominee agreed to the network and date and the Democrat matched him. Trump confirmed the details on Thursday, at a Mar-a-Lago press conference, reversing the position heâd staked out six days earlier â that he couldnât show up because he was âin litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest.â\n\nAt that time, Trump had proposed a Sept. 4 debate hosted by Fox News, with a live audience, resurrecting a demand that Republicans had made for years; the party announced in 2022 that it would seek partners outside the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. One reason, given by then-RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, was a need to start âhosting debates before voting begins.â The Sept. 4 date fits that bill, but the Harris-Walz campaign never agreed to it. âIâm happy to have that conversation about an additional debate after Sept. 10,â Harris told reporters on Thursday, in her first exchange on the tarmac with her traveling press corps.\n\nNo vice presidential debate has been scheduled yet. When Biden still led the Democratic ticket, the parties were discussing two possible dates â July 23 or Aug. 13. The first date came and went as Joe Biden quit the race and Harris was securing the nomination, and Vance has since ruled out debating Tim Walz before the DNC. âWould it shock me if the Democrats pulled another switcheroo?â Vance asked rhetorically, on Wednesday, when reporters followed up on debate plans. âNo, it wouldnât.â\n\nThe Republican establishment battled conservative insurgents in Tuesdayâs primaries , in races where Donald Trump gave up on trying to anoint a candidate and spread his endorsements between multiple Republicans.\n\nIn Missouri, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe captured the nomination for governor, holding off conservative state Sen. Bill Eigel, who ran to the right of a GOP that controls every office in the state and a supermajority in the legislature. Eigel won some conservative exurbs, but nearly two-thirds of the primary vote went to Kehoe or Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Republicans Eigel had clashed with as he condemned Kehoeâs calls for âcivilityâ and an effort to add exceptions to the stateâs abortion law.\n\nState Sen. Denny Hoskins won the race to succeed Ashcroft, a win for the GOPâs right flank; declaring victory, he promised to ensure that ânone of the electoral fraud that took place in 2020 and stole the election from President Trump happens here.â The bizarre candidacy of Valentina Gomez, who had no political experience and spent the campaign accusing opponents of being corrupt, âweak,â and âgay,â went nowhere: She got 7% of the vote. Attorney Gen. Andrew Bailey carried every county over Trump attorney Will Scharf, who pointed out that some of Baileyâs high-profile pro-Trump cases were stunts , but never got traction.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump-endorsed ex-Rep. Mike Rogers easily won the partyâs U.S. Senate nomination, defeating libertarian Trump critic Justin Amash; in Washington, Trump-endorsed ex-NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler led the top-two primary over Rep. Daniel Newhouse. (Trump also backed veterans advocate Tiffany Smiley , who entered the race late and faced questions over a PAC she founded that spent little on other candidates.) Newhouse, one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021, will now need Democratic votes to beat a MAGA candidate in November.\n\nMissouri Rep. Cori Bush lost her primary on Tuesday , making her just the second House Democrat, and the second member of the progressive âsquad,â to lose re-election this cycle. Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, beat her by 5 points , carrying his home base by 11,000 votes; Bush won the city by just 4,000 votes.\n\nTurnout was up significantly from 2022, when Bell held off a weak challenger. But Bush got fewer votes this year, despite locking down far more local support than New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, the other progressive pushed out of his House seat this summer. St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones backed Bush, and her endorsers condemned AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups for trying to oust a working class nurse-turned-congresswoman who came straight out of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIt didnât work. Like Bowman, Bush was hobbled by her vote against the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill â a progressive negotiating tactic that AIPAC, Democratic Majority for Israel, and other critics characterized as an attack on the Biden agenda. And she never recovered from an investigation into her use of campaign funds for personal security, which benefited her husband. DMFI chairman Mark Mellmanâs polling initially gave Bush a lead over Bell, with vulnerabilities. And for six months, her opponents effectively attacked those vulnerabilities.\n\nFor Mellman's rundown of the strategy to beat Israel critics in primaries, keep reading... â\n\nFor Mellman's rundown of the strategy to beat Israel critics in primaries, keep reading... â\n\nDemocrats were in denial all year about the Biden-led ticketâs ability to rebuild the 2020 coalition. The Harris-led ticket has recovered for two reasons. One: A rebound of her personal favorable rating, driven by Democrats and liberal independents, which few Republicans expected. (They had hoped and assumed that her low ratings would stick.) Two: New Democratic enthusiasm, which Republicans did expect, given how depressed their opponents were about the presidentâs stumbling and weak messaging. The top of the ballot in Wisconsin is tied, but for the first time all year, Democrats are as excited to vote as Republicans are.\n\nDemocratic enthusiasm for the new ticket has surged even though that ticket is running behind Biden at this point in the 2020 election. But Harris has closed some of a gap weâve seen in every competitive Senate state â Democrats, out-spending their opponents everywhere, running much stronger than their presidential candidate. Gallego, whoâs out-raised Lake by a 3-1 margin, runs 18 points ahead of her with independents. Harris leads with those voters by 8 points. In 2020 and 2022, Arizona Democrats slightly underperformed their final polls, with one exception â Lake led going into election day, and lost by 17,000 votes.\n\nDemocrats are being admirably chatty right now about the decisions that ended Joe Bidenâs presidential campaign. âIâve never been that impressed with his political operation,â Nancy Pelosi said in a sit-down with David Remnick. Ryan Lizzaâs interview with Anita Dunn gets the perspective of someone Pelosi was talking about. Democrats are aware of how much Donald Trump didnât want Biden to quit, and they donât care: âI donât regard it as a coup,â explained Dunn.\n\nHow long had Donald Trump wanted to run for president again, after his 2020 defeat? How much did he believe that his defeat was a fraud, and could be reversed in court? Why and how did the Republican Party shake off its concerns and embrace him again? All of those questions get answered in âTrump in Exile,â Politico reporter Meridith McGrawâs new book about the days between the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trumpâs easy re-nomination win, six months ago. Itâs got too many rich moments to highlight here; Iâm fond of the golf game that saved JD Vanceâs Trump endorsement, the awful alternative names for Trumpâs social network before âTruth Socialâ got settled on, and the origins of the Ron DeSanctimonious nickname that, against all odds, really clicked.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Has âThe Squadâsâ era passed? An interview with Justice Democratsâ Alexandra Rojas.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nAll kinds of Democratic dreams died on Nov. 5. For progressives, the key defeats had happened months earlier.\n\nNew York Rep. Jamaal Bowman and Missouri Rep. Cori Bush lost their primaries thanks to a torrent of money from pro-Israel and centrist Democratic groups, which recruited less left-wing candidates â Rep.-elect George Latimer, Rep.-elect Wesley Bell. They were the first incumbent defeats for Justice Democrats, founded in 2017 by veterans of Bernie Sandersâs first presidential campaign to replace âcorporate Democratsâ with progressives with working class backgrounds and no PAC money.\n\nThose races consumed Justice Democratsâ attention this year â the first, since its founding, when it did not recruit more candidates to run against Democrats in safe seats, or in open seats that the party was likely to win. Alexandra Rojas, the groupâs executive director, talked with Americana about its still-forming 2026 plans, and about a Democratic blame game that has followed the partyâs tradition â heaping responsibility on progressives and left-wing ideas.\n\nAmericana: How does Justice Democrats view 2026? Is it going to be another cycle on defense, or are you going to go on the offense in new seats?\n\nAlexandra Rojas: Weâre definitely on the offensive. Since we started, our whole pitch has been that working people deserve just as much as billionaires to run our government. We were making the case that the Democratic Party has really lost its way, especially with working people. And in this Congress, Republicans have everything.\n\nThere is this vacuum of leadership in the party, especially at our highest levels of power. Thereâs been a directive from voters that itâs time to clean up shop, that they do not want people that have been in power.That the leadership void could be filled by those who represent the working class â or it can be continued to be filled by Democrats that are really comfortable cozying up with Wall Street and billionaires, which was a huge part of this cycle. This donor, pundit, strategist class that has had a lot of the power in the party was repudiated.\n\nHow and when are you going to recruit candidates?\n\nItâs part art, part science. Candidate recruitment is a 24/7/365 thing for us. Weâre constantly getting nominations through our website. Weâre constantly doing research into Democratic districts across the country, looking at the data. This cycle, we want to kind of put all corporate Democrats on notice. Thereâs a hunger for that, and weâve seen it through our supporter base.\n\nWhatâs the art and science after this year? Because the districts that look safe for Democrats changed this year: Justice Democrats targeted Henry Cuellarâs seat when it was deep blue, and itâs shifted right. In New Jersey, Dems nearly lost Bill Pascrellâs seat â that was safe until right now.\n\nWeâre going to continue to lean into where our competitive edge has been, which is deep blue and open seats in Democratic districts. Even in places like Laredo, which youâre alluding to â these are places that I think Democrats take for granted. We want to have Democrats that represent the full working class base and make sure that they are not accepting money from these corporate special interests that are quite literally destroying our democracy and taking away votersâ choice. Thatâs what we saw this year, especially from AIPAC and crypto.\n\nDuring the last Trump presidency, it was âThe Squad,â in a lot of cases, that was really taking it to the Republicans. And they were getting the most negative coverage. They are going to continue to take the brunt of that, and the leadership is going to be tested on how they respond in those moments. When this administration is cutting taxes for the wealthy, or doing anything else thatâs going to hurt working people, we need leaders who are going to speak to that pain, while also not taking money from those same billionaires and corporations that are going to have a free-for-all under Trump.\n\nWhere do you expect to be on defense? I talked with Democratic Majority for Israel; the fact that Tlaib didnât endorse Harris, thatâs something they may use against her, even if theyâve struggled to find a real candidate. They didnât get very far with the challenge against Ilhan Omar, but sheâs on notice, too.\n\nI mean, based on the level of money thatâs been spent, weâre on defense all the time. They have the money, they have the resources, and theyâre going to attack Rashida and the rest of âThe Squadâ all the time. It was unprecedented for $30 million to be spent against Justice Democrats in just two primaries, against a nurse and a principal. Everybody who cares about these members and what they represent needs to be on alert, and needs to be talking, right now, about this threat that big money in politics poses to democracy.\n\nWe saw that through Elon basically helping Trump buy this presidency. That was a bigger factor in this election than some activists saying a couple slogans a couple years ago.\n\nThanks for bringing that up. One of the big arguments about the election, from centrists, is that âthe groupsâ on the left committed the party to bad rhetoric and crazy ideas. What does âthe groupsâ mean to you?\n\nThey are scapegoats. Every cycle, the people in charge of the Party and its campaigns blame social movement groups that rarely have a seat at the table for their own failings and shortcomings. To them, âthe groupsâ are anyone but themselves because thatâs the only way they will continue to remain in power cycle after cycle. When we know the truthâ The same donors, pundits, consultants, and politicians who have been in charge of the Party for decades are responsible for keeping Democrats beholden to the needs of corporations and billionaires, rather than everyday people.\n\nThe campaign we saw play out this year was overwhelmingly not progressive, because if it was, economic populism would be at its core, and that doesnât come at the expense of marginalized communities. No Democrat ran on protecting trans children, or immigrants, or defund the police, so I wish that there was more self-reflection on their part. I do think that progressives, people like myself, are asking the same questions about where we go from here. I would hope that thereâs more introspection from them. Maybe some humility, too.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "How a ceasefire-backing progressive scared pro-Israel groups out of her race\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPITTSBURGH â To win a safe Democratic seat here in 2022, Rep. Summer Lee had to overcome nearly $4 million in ad spending by AIPACâs super PAC. Democratic Majority for Israel spent nearly $500,000 more, helping her less-progressive primary opponent come within 978 votes of beating her.\n\nâYou have to brace yourself,â Lee said in an interview, reflecting on that race. âYou recognize that one interest group is able to completely change the course of a campaign.â And six months ago, when pro-Israel groups said theyâd work to beat Democrats who wanted an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Lee was near the top of their list, telling The New York Times that Israelâs response âlook increasingly like a genocide of innocent Gazans.â\n\nBut AIPAC and DMFI havenât spent anything in Pennsylvaniaâs 12th Congressional District this year. What looked like risky politics in October, when Democrats condemned the tone of some ceasefire protests, is becoming a mainstream position with primary voters.\n\nâInstead of shaming the uncommitted movement and calling them extremists, we need to recognize that the Democratic Party canât win without this coalition,â Lee said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Lee campaignâs polling has mirrored national public polling, with most self-identified Democrats turning on the war since last year. Last week, when Lee signed a letter urging the Biden administration to stop weapon transfers after an IDF strike that killed aid workers, she was joined by Nancy Pelosi.\n\nâOur money is being used to finance a war that is massacring people by the thousands,â said Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist in Pittsburgh who supports Lee. âSummer believes that Israel is being empowered by what our government does. I agree with her completely. Thatâs one reason why sheâs come under attack. She and people in Congress who agree with her are opposed by big money that supports the Israeli war right now.â\n\nLee has pulled some skeptics to her side with constituent work , rallied with the Biden campaign , and scooped up endorsements. That answered one of the most effective attacks against her in 2022 â that sheâd undermine Biden and hurt her party. (âSummer Lee attacked Bidenâs character,â warned one of UDPâs primary ads.) After looking closely at the race, pro-Israel groups decided that the primary wasnât winnable. Democrats such as New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman and Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, weakened by scandals totally unrelated to the Gaza issue, looked vulnerable. Lee did not.\n\nLeeâs challenger, suburban city councilmember Bhavini Patel, hasnât let the ceasefire issue go. Sheâs gotten air cover from a different super PAC , funded partly by GOP billionaire Jeff Yass, a connection that Leeâs cited to discredit its ads In a televised debate last week, Patel told Lee that she âcannot stand in this community with the heartache and the challenges our Jewish community is facing,â and ripped her for confirming, then canceling , a speech at a Muslim organizationâs dinner, after Jewish Insider revealed antisemitic comments by other guests.\n\nâItâs incredibly important that we are sensitive about the language that we use,â Patel said in an interview near her campaign office â and near the Tree of Life Synagogue, where a gunman murdered 11 Jewish worshippers in 2018. (Last month, the Democratic club in the surrounding ward endorsed her.) After the killing of World Central Kitchen workers last week, âmy opponent put out a tweet, saying that they targeted â her word â âtargetedâ humanitarian aid workers.â\n\nLeeâs choices, according to Patel, âreally have significant implications for whatâs happening here at home, in terms of stoking antisemitism.\n\nBut Patelâs positioning, and her criticism of the way Lee talked about Biden and Gaza, hasnât shaken up this race. On Saturday morning, a dozen staff and volunteers for the progressive group Pennsylvania United met at their headquarters before canvassing for Lee. Several wore âFree Palestineâ buttons on their T-shirts, as a group leader told them how the issue was playing out at the doors.\n\nâIt hasnât come up a whole lot,â the volunteer said. âNow, yesterday, we did hear somebody say: âOh, well, I canât support her, because I just canât believe that she doesnât back Israel in the city where the Tree of Life massacre happened.â And thatâs a very heavy issue to deal with.â His advice: Talk about how Lee had âbeen on the forefront of bringing back money to create a memorial for those victims.â\n\nThe story about Democrats and Israel has largely, and understandably, been about whether the war could tear the party apart . The president canât give a speech without being interrupted by pro-ceasefire protesters; every primary vote for âuncommittedâ is covered by the media for its potential to swing the November election to Donald Trump.\n\nBut the Democratic baseâs fatigue with Israelâs counteroffensive is real, and itâs a factor in Pittsburgh. Of the 13 progressive House Democrats who called for a ceasefire on Oct. 16, three were from Chicago, and none of them broke a sweat to win their primaries last month. Lee, the next Democrat facing this test, has benefitted from incumbency, from changing moods about the war, and from progressive fears that their small bloc in Congress is being targeted.\n\nProgressive donors mobilized quickly around Lee. By the end of 2023, sheâd raised $1.4 million; she raised $1.9 million, total, for the 2022 race where she had to fend off millions of dollars from the extended AIPAC universe. (Patel had raised nearly $311,000 by the end of last year.) And the Democratic Partyâs shift on Israel has clearly helped her. Lee said that she agreed with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumerâs speech last month, urging Israel to hold new elections , and urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to go.\n\nâIt really speaks to how obvious the international violations are right now,â she said. âWeâre seeing this movement from Democratic politicians who have traditionally been very friendly, and given a lot of grace to Netanyahuâs government.â\n\nPatel had a different response to Schumer: âI think Israelâs an independent democracy, and we should let democracy play out.â What she was hearing from voters, she said, was less about the warâs specifics, and more about whether Lee was âequivocating on her support for Biden.â At her debate with Lee, and in our interview, she wondered why Lee had not condemned the âuncommittedâ protest campaign, and whether she could be counted on to help Biden win the election.\n\nLee told Semafor her support for Biden in November was not in question.\n\nâI recognize that in the general election, my choices will be Biden and Trump, and there is no world in which Iâm supporting Trump,â said Lee. âI donât want that man in control. I think that he is a cult leader.â\n\nLast month, dozens of rabbis in Leeâs district, including Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life Congregation, signed an open letter that accused Lee of using âdivisive rhetoricâ that some of them perceived as âantisemitic.â\n\nâWe call on you to denounce antisemitism fully and frequently, including returning contributions and declining support from those who have voiced hateful views,â they wrote. âWe, like you, want a just and fair end to the hostilities. We believe that the best result will come from open commitments to new behavior, to an end to division, and to a commitment to care for and protect all people. Stand with us, reject the voices of hate, and together we can build the world for which we all pray.â\n\nPro-Israel groups didnât mobilize against Lee, but the Working Families Party and other endorsers (the Muslim political group Emgage, Justice Democrats) went on air early to help her. âShe is a strong candidate whoâs been really successful here,â said Nick Gavio, the mid-Atlantic spokesman for the WFP, who lives in Pittsburgh. âSheâs doing events with cabinet secretaries all the time, bringing money home, and people see that.â\n\nAdam Gold, a senior strategist for the WFP National PAC, said Leeâs allies put together their defense plan in February. âWe were preparing for a pretty serious attack, like last time, and didnât want to wait until the last minute,â he said. âWe want her to be in Congress, winning for working class people, for a long time. And after this primary, we need to go big for other champions who are facing more pressure.â\n\nMark Mellman, the founder of DMFI, released polling last week that showed Bowman, the New York Congressman, badly trailing pro-Israel George Latimer in the primary. Some Democrats whoâd criticized Israel and called for a ceasefire were vulnerable, he said. Lee didnât seem to be, and his group opted not to play in her race this cycle, after nearly beating her last time.\n\nâHer Israel position is a significant demerit for pro-Israel voters, but that is not the most salient issue for every voter,â said Mellman.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Americana\n\nAlso: A new book tracks Donald Trumpâs post-2020 exile.\n\nBehold: The normal presidential campaign! For the first time in eight years, Iâve just gotten back from a Democratic rally that featured both halves of the ticket with no COVID or masking requirements and a strong presumption they would actually be the nominees come November. It felt like a good moment â maybe the last moment â for a heat check on whatâs become a recognizable election, with two competing campaigns holding normal events and fighting minute-by-minute for the news cycle.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, Democrats wanted to talk about their crowds. Their voters were trudging a mile from mud-bound cars to see the newly completed presidential ticket . They were fainting in the heat as they stood through warm-up speeches and ran out of bottled water. They were pinning new lime green âbratâ buttons on their shirts and wearing fresh â Cat Ladies for Kamala â gear. They were chanting (âKA-MA-LAâ) over the protesters whoâd showed up to demand an arms embargo on Israel â protesters who used to get heard more clearly over the nervous is-he-okay quiet of Joe Bidenâs speeches.\n\nâI feel a lot better than I did in 2016 at this time,â said Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, gazing out at 15,000 people in a hangar of Detroitâs international airport on Wednesday. She was one of the few Democrats to warn that Hillary Clinton was vulnerable in the state in that election.\n\nâI donât know how I can explain it to you,â marveled Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 36 hours into his role as the Democratic candidate for vice president. âWalking into that arena in Philly, or that field out in Wisconsin, or right here â to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign.â\n\nThe presidential nominee delivered a drum-tight stump speech, which has differed so little from state to state that anti-Harris accounts on X have already spliced videos together to try to drum a scandal out of the repetition. In the hangar, for people hearing it for the first time, every line hit â denunciations of Donald Trump and Project 2025, the slogan that âweâre not going back,â a thank-you to Joe Biden, and promises to lower prices and help âbuild wealthâ for the working class.\n\nâUnderstand: In this fight, we are joyful warriors,â Harris said. âWe know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work.â The cheer was loud enough to set off decibel warnings on Apple watches, and she repeated the line: âHard work is good work.â\n\nFor David's view, keep reading... â\n\nFor David's view, keep reading... â\n\nJD Vance had a mission this week: Chase Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. In every city where they rallied, he showed up for a press conference, deriding the Democrats for not taking questions, ribbing the media for not demanding them. In Eau Claire, Wis., Vance and his entourage walked over to Air Force to (âI just wanted to check out my future planeâ) and said he felt sorry for the Harris traveling press. One day later, for the first time, that press pool got to throw questions at Harris from the tarmac.\n\nVanceâs biggest success: Elevating questions about Tim Walzâs retirement from the Army National Guard. On Tuesday, the Harris-Walz campaign shared a video of Walz talking to a crowd about limits on certain firearms, like the ones he âcarried in war.â In Eau Claire, Vance questioned the âstolen valor crapâ coming from the Democrat â Walz had deployed to Europe for Operation Enduring Freedom, but not seen combat in Afghanistan.\n\nâI think thatâs going to follow him around, because veterans, and I think non-veterans, are really pissed off that he claimed to do something that he didnât do,â he told Semaforâs Shelby Talcott in an interview from the campaign plane.\n\nFor Shelby Talcottâs exclusive interview with Vance, keep readingâ¦ â\n\nFor Shelby Talcottâs exclusive interview with Vance, keep readingâ¦ â\n\nABC News will host the first Trump-Harris debate on Sept. 10, after the GOP nominee agreed to the network and date and the Democrat matched him. Trump confirmed the details on Thursday, at a Mar-a-Lago press conference, reversing the position heâd staked out six days earlier â that he couldnât show up because he was âin litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest.â\n\nAt that time, Trump had proposed a Sept. 4 debate hosted by Fox News, with a live audience, resurrecting a demand that Republicans had made for years; the party announced in 2022 that it would seek partners outside the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. One reason, given by then-RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, was a need to start âhosting debates before voting begins.â The Sept. 4 date fits that bill, but the Harris-Walz campaign never agreed to it. âIâm happy to have that conversation about an additional debate after Sept. 10,â Harris told reporters on Thursday, in her first exchange on the tarmac with her traveling press corps.\n\nNo vice presidential debate has been scheduled yet. When Biden still led the Democratic ticket, the parties were discussing two possible dates â July 23 or Aug. 13. The first date came and went as Joe Biden quit the race and Harris was securing the nomination, and Vance has since ruled out debating Tim Walz before the DNC. âWould it shock me if the Democrats pulled another switcheroo?â Vance asked rhetorically, on Wednesday, when reporters followed up on debate plans. âNo, it wouldnât.â\n\nThe Republican establishment battled conservative insurgents in Tuesdayâs primaries , in races where Donald Trump gave up on trying to anoint a candidate and spread his endorsements between multiple Republicans.\n\nIn Missouri, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe captured the nomination for governor, holding off conservative state Sen. Bill Eigel, who ran to the right of a GOP that controls every office in the state and a supermajority in the legislature. Eigel won some conservative exurbs, but nearly two-thirds of the primary vote went to Kehoe or Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Republicans Eigel had clashed with as he condemned Kehoeâs calls for âcivilityâ and an effort to add exceptions to the stateâs abortion law.\n\nState Sen. Denny Hoskins won the race to succeed Ashcroft, a win for the GOPâs right flank; declaring victory, he promised to ensure that ânone of the electoral fraud that took place in 2020 and stole the election from President Trump happens here.â The bizarre candidacy of Valentina Gomez, who had no political experience and spent the campaign accusing opponents of being corrupt, âweak,â and âgay,â went nowhere: She got 7% of the vote. Attorney Gen. Andrew Bailey carried every county over Trump attorney Will Scharf, who pointed out that some of Baileyâs high-profile pro-Trump cases were stunts , but never got traction.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump-endorsed ex-Rep. Mike Rogers easily won the partyâs U.S. Senate nomination, defeating libertarian Trump critic Justin Amash; in Washington, Trump-endorsed ex-NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler led the top-two primary over Rep. Daniel Newhouse. (Trump also backed veterans advocate Tiffany Smiley , who entered the race late and faced questions over a PAC she founded that spent little on other candidates.) Newhouse, one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021, will now need Democratic votes to beat a MAGA candidate in November.\n\nMissouri Rep. Cori Bush lost her primary on Tuesday , making her just the second House Democrat, and the second member of the progressive âsquad,â to lose re-election this cycle. Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, beat her by 5 points , carrying his home base by 11,000 votes; Bush won the city by just 4,000 votes.\n\nTurnout was up significantly from 2022, when Bell held off a weak challenger. But Bush got fewer votes this year, despite locking down far more local support than New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, the other progressive pushed out of his House seat this summer. St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones backed Bush, and her endorsers condemned AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups for trying to oust a working class nurse-turned-congresswoman who came straight out of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIt didnât work. Like Bowman, Bush was hobbled by her vote against the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill â a progressive negotiating tactic that AIPAC, Democratic Majority for Israel, and other critics characterized as an attack on the Biden agenda. And she never recovered from an investigation into her use of campaign funds for personal security, which benefited her husband. DMFI chairman Mark Mellmanâs polling initially gave Bush a lead over Bell, with vulnerabilities. And for six months, her opponents effectively attacked those vulnerabilities.\n\nFor Mellman's rundown of the strategy to beat Israel critics in primaries, keep reading... â\n\nFor Mellman's rundown of the strategy to beat Israel critics in primaries, keep reading... â\n\nDemocrats were in denial all year about the Biden-led ticketâs ability to rebuild the 2020 coalition. The Harris-led ticket has recovered for two reasons. One: A rebound of her personal favorable rating, driven by Democrats and liberal independents, which few Republicans expected. (They had hoped and assumed that her low ratings would stick.) Two: New Democratic enthusiasm, which Republicans did expect, given how depressed their opponents were about the presidentâs stumbling and weak messaging. The top of the ballot in Wisconsin is tied, but for the first time all year, Democrats are as excited to vote as Republicans are.\n\nDemocratic enthusiasm for the new ticket has surged even though that ticket is running behind Biden at this point in the 2020 election. But Harris has closed some of a gap weâve seen in every competitive Senate state â Democrats, out-spending their opponents everywhere, running much stronger than their presidential candidate. Gallego, whoâs out-raised Lake by a 3-1 margin, runs 18 points ahead of her with independents. Harris leads with those voters by 8 points. In 2020 and 2022, Arizona Democrats slightly underperformed their final polls, with one exception â Lake led going into election day, and lost by 17,000 votes.\n\nDemocrats are being admirably chatty right now about the decisions that ended Joe Bidenâs presidential campaign. âIâve never been that impressed with his political operation,â Nancy Pelosi said in a sit-down with David Remnick. Ryan Lizzaâs interview with Anita Dunn gets the perspective of someone Pelosi was talking about. Democrats are aware of how much Donald Trump didnât want Biden to quit, and they donât care: âI donât regard it as a coup,â explained Dunn.\n\nHow long had Donald Trump wanted to run for president again, after his 2020 defeat? How much did he believe that his defeat was a fraud, and could be reversed in court? Why and how did the Republican Party shake off its concerns and embrace him again? All of those questions get answered in âTrump in Exile,â Politico reporter Meridith McGrawâs new book about the days between the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trumpâs easy re-nomination win, six months ago. Itâs got too many rich moments to highlight here; Iâm fond of the golf game that saved JD Vanceâs Trump endorsement, the awful alternative names for Trumpâs social network before âTruth Socialâ got settled on, and the origins of the Ron DeSanctimonious nickname that, against all odds, really clicked.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Democrats angle for spots on House Judiciary, and Oversight could be next\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nDemocrats have already started competing for what will be one of the most sought-after slots in Congress next year: a seat on the House Judiciary Committee. And if Donald Trump wins the presidency, the Oversight Committee could become just as popular.\n\nWhile the Judiciary panel is always a prize assignment for both parties, Democrats are eager to join it in part because of their electoral outlook; their party could easily retake the House this fall but lose control of the Senate. If the House is Democratsâ congressional power base next year, the Judiciary Committee would become a forum for President Kamala Harrisâ highest priorities â or the starting point of any impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.\n\nSeveral younger lawmakers are looking to join in. Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y. and Summer Lee, D-Pa. have all expressed interest in joining the Judiciary Committee, Semafor has learned.\n\nAll of the Judiciary contenders except Kamlager-Dove currently sit on the House Oversight Committee, which gives its own spotlight to members of Congress who want to take on alleged misuse of government resources by the opposition. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other progressives on the âSquadâ turned their Oversight seats into vehicles for stardom during Trumpâs first term; if the former president wins again, that committee could become just as popular a request as Judiciary.\n\nâDonât you think Dems would want to be on Oversight more in a Trump presidency?â one senior Democratic aide quipped to Semafor.\n\nBoth Crockett and Goldman are lawyers â she a public defender turned national co-chair for Harrisâ campaign, and he a former prosecutor who worked on Trumpâs first impeachment. Theyâve had their share of news-making moments in hearings during the Biden administration; Crockettâs viral rejoinder to âbleach blonde, butch bodyâ Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. was enough of a sensation to inspire clapback-themed gear .\n\nFrost came to Congress with a background in progressive organizing and has embraced his identity as the first Generation Z lawmaker. Lee served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, and Kamlager-Dove served as a California state legislator, focusing on incarceration issues.\n\nNone of the Democratic Judiciary hopefuls responded to requests for comment.\n\nThere will be more openings on the Judiciary Committee if Democrats take back the House next month, but even if Republicans score a clean sweep on Election Day, there will likely still be spots to claim. Two current Democratic Judiciary members are leaving the House next year: California Rep. Adam Schiff is on track to ascend to the Senate, while Missouri Rep. Cori Bush lost to a Democratic primary challenger.\n\nTheir replacements, and any new committee members, are chosen by a group known as the Steering Committee thatâs aligned with party leaders. That groupâs decisions on where lawmakers sit in the House are often influenced by heavy internal lobbying. Both parties usually want to maintain geographical diversity on committees; newly elected members are often given priority, especially if theyâre from battleground areas.\n\nThe Judiciary panel also has jurisdiction over immigration, as well as the Supreme Court and some consumer-focused antitrust issues that became prominent during the pandemic.\n\nIn the event of a Trump win and a House Democratic majority next year, impeachments â whether of the president or Cabinet officials â would also inevitably get discussed on the committee.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nHASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, NY â On Friday afternoon, before he brought Bernie Sanders onstage at a riverside rally, Rep. Jamaal Bowman introduced the crowd to Mayor Nicola Armacost.\n\nâWhen I got into office, she opened this municipality to me,â said Bowman. âWhatâs this, a village? A village! She opened this village to me.â He praised her courage, her experience, and her willingness to stand up to his challenger, Westchester County executive George Latimer.\n\nâAnd thatâs it,â Bowman said. âWe ainât got no more local endorsements.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nElected in 2020 after ousting a longtime Democratic incumbent with a surge of progressive votes , Bowman is heading into Election Day on Tuesday as an out-spent underdog.\n\nJust four years ago, he was part of a successful progressive strategy, kicked off by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her nearby Bronx district, to vault the left into greater political relevance. With the help of groups like Justice Democrats, activists targeted safe blue seats held by longtime moderates and recruited allied candidates to build a growing âSquadâ in Congress. Momentum was on their side.\n\nThis year, the same movement is playing defense instead and Bowmanâs race is seen as a potential turning point. The congressman and his allies describe his race as a test of whether the most expensive House primary in history â more than $21 million on Latimerâs behalf, $14.5 million of it from the pro-Israel group AIPACâs super PAC â can break what the left spent years building.\n\nâIt is one of the most significant elections in the modern history of this country,â said Sanders. âThis election is about whether billionaire super PACs can buy our democracy.â\n\nIf Bowman wins this primary, heâll have overcome nonstop negative ads, abandonment by some former supporters, and a turnout effort thatâs driven out votes in Latimerâs best areas. If he loses â as no member of the extended Squad ever has â the progressive effort to humble AIPAC, which theyâve tried to define as a pro-Republican front group, will absorb a massive defeat.\n\nNo Democrat has made that argument as consistently and passionately as Bowman. According to him , Latimer is both an âanti-Black racistâ and an âanti-Muslim racist.â The evidence: His tongue-tied comments about the âethnicâ advantage Bowman has with Black voters, and his comment that Bowmanâs âconstituency is Dearborn, Mich.,â not Westchester County. (Latimer has since explained that he was talking about Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American who represents Dearborn, raising money for Bowman.)\n\nâIâm an outspoken Black man,â Bowman said at the close of his final debate with Latimer, explaining why AIPAC had targeted him. âI fight against genocide in Gaza, and I fight for justice right here.â When I asked Bowman what heâd say to AIPAC if he won his race, a question I asked AIPAC target Dave Min a few months ago, Bowman said he wouldnât call the group at all.\n\nâI think the win will speak for itself,â said Bowman. âI think what we have to do is double down and continue to organize the grassroots, and labor, and the American people, to save and preserve our democracy.â\n\nThat worked in April, when Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee fended off a challenger who criticized her support for a ceasefire and accused her of being an anti-Biden chaos agent. AIPAC stayed out of that race, surmising that Lee couldnât lose; Lee made moves to keep them out, backing out of an appearance at a Muslim event after learning that one speaker made positive comments about Oct. 7.\n\nPro-Israel groups focused on this race instead. Bowman spent most of it on his back heel, buffeted by negative stories that no one had written in 2020, and abandoned by some endorsers, like the progressive pro-Israel group J Street, over his louder criticism of Israel. He told Democratic Socialists of America that he now supported the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, reversing his 2020 position; he accused Latimer of supporting âgenocide,â and called AIPAC a âZionist regime.â\n\nKNOW MORE\n\nThe strategists at participating PACs are confident that theyâll beat Bowman, whose grasp on the 16th Congressional District was shaky before a dollar was spent this year. Two years ago, as an incumbent seeking his first re-election, Bowman won just 54% of the primary vote â a landslide in the small Bronx portion of the seat, and a weak performance in Westchester.\n\nâThe hatred against the congressman was just phenomenal,â said Brook Packard, a local who canvassed for Bowman that year in Rye, where Latimer lives. âPeople slammed the door in our face. They said they were disgusted with him and the Squad. It wasnât so much that they loved his opponents. They were anti-Bowman.â\n\nOver the next year, the anti-Bowman resistance mobilized. After Hamasâs attack on Israel, the congressman called for an immediate ceasefire and accused the country of peddling âpropaganda,â telling a crowd that âthereâs still no evidence of beheaded babies or raped womenâ â comments heâd retract months later as reports of sexual violence continued to emerge . Days before the 10/7 attack against Israel, Bowman was caught on camera pulling a House office fire alarm, which he called a mistake, generating what-was-he-thinking coverage back home that had nothing to do with Israel. He later pleaded guilty to a related charge and was censured on the House floor.\n\nIn January, shortly after Latimer entered the race, the county executiveâs own polling showed him 10 points ahead of Bowman. Armacost, the mayor of a small, progressive village, stuck by Bowman; the mayor of Yonkers, Bowmanâs home and the districtâs biggest city, went for Latimer.\n\nâAIPAC found a candidate that was willing to be bought,â said Ana MarÃ­a Archila, the co-director of New Yorkâs Working Families Party, which has organized for Bowman in every race. âThey havenât been able to do that in other places.â\n\nSince 2018, when veterans of Bernie Sandersâs first presidential bid began running progressive candidates in deep blue districts, theyâd elected nine of them, from Rep. Ayanna Pressley in Boston to Rep. Greg Casar in Austin. In each race, the goal was to find a âcompelling young leader that reflects the community,â as Justice Democrats co-founder Alexandra Rojas explained in 2019, replacing âan older career establishment politician that does not reflect the true diversity of that district.â\n\nBowman, a Black high school principal whoâd never sought office before, epitomized what JD wanted. In 2020, he defeated Rep. Eliot Engel by 15 points, capitalizing on an awkward incident when the elderly congressman, who had hunkered down in his Maryland residence during COVID, pleaded for speaking time at a New York Black Lives Matter rally. âIf I didnât have a primary,â he explained, âI wouldnât care.â\n\nLatimer presented a different challenge â a well-liked name brand, with an electoral career in the district that he started when the 46-year old Bowman was in elementary school. Pro-Bowman media amplified his argument, that the county executive was a secret racist tasked with eliminating a Black member of Congress.\n\nâHe says Iâve taken money from Hamas,â Bowman told me. âHeâs made outlandish comments about Emmett Till and Governor Cuomo. Heâs taking money from a PAC which targets 85% people of color.â\n\nIn the raceâs closing days, Bowman has honed that argument, asking if Westchester County really wants to oust its first Black congressman. On Saturday, when Sanders and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez rallied for Bowman in the Bronx, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said that the congressmanâs enemies kept âputting this caricature on him, of an angry Black man.â\n\nWhen he took the stage, Bowman rapped the first four bars of Wu Tang Clanâs âTriumph,â rolled up his shirtsleeves (âlet me get the guns outâ), hoisted a three-legged stool in the air, and called himself âthe hip-hop congressmanâ who AIPAC was âscared to deathâ of.\n\nâWeâre gonna show fucking AIPAC the motherfucking power of the South Bronx,â said Bowman; the South Bronx is not in his district, but buses were ready to take volunteers north when it was over. âPeople ask me, why I got a foul mouth? What am I supposed to do? You cominâ after me. You cominâ after my family. You cominâ after my children. Iâm not supposed to fight back?â\n\nTHE VIEW FROM THE LEFT\n\nThe bulk of the progressive movement, including Jewish Voices for Peace and organizations built by Sanders campaign veterans, is behind Bowman. They share his view that the race is an existential test of whether big money can remove their allies from Congress.\n\nâDemocrats always talk about how we donât like Citizens United,â Sanders told Semafor. âI requested over a year ago, to Democratic leadership: Keep Super PACs out of Democratic primaries. That, they could have done.â\n\nAt the Bronx rally, where hundreds of progressives rallied under ruthless heat â two attendees fainted â Bowman volunteers worried that any victory for AIPAC would be seen as a warning to Democrats, that they could not criticize Israel and keep their seats.\n\nâI am really worried about the far right and about the normalization of genocidal rhetoric in America,â said Genevieve Rand, a 27-year old trans woman who had taken a five-hour bus ride from Ithaca to canvass for Bowman. âThis is the front line of that fight in this country right now.â\n\nOthers disagree. In 2020, at the height of what progressives called the George Floyd uprising, the left was united behind Bowman. This year, in addition to losing J Street, the Bronx rally was protested by drum-banging members of pro-Palestinian group Within Our Lifetime, who chanted that Bowman, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez were supporting âgenocideâ by supporting Joe Biden.\n\nTHE VIEW FROM AIPAC\n\nâRep. Bowmanâs scurrilous and shameful attacks wonât hide his record of aligning with the extremist, anti-Israel fringe,â said AIPAC spokesman Marshall Wittman. âIn contrast to his opponent, George Latimer is a pro-Israel progressive who stands with the Jewish state as it battles Iranian terrorist proxies.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nNew York. The Bowman-Latimer race has dominated the airwaves, but there are intra-Democratic party battles around New York City tonight. In Suffolk County, author and former CNN commentator John Avlon is running against Nancy Goroff, a chemist who lost the 2020 race for a similar version of their 1st Congressional District. Goroff (and Republicans) have portrayed Avlon as an interloper, parachuting into Hamptons, and Goroffâs loaned her campaign more than a million dollars to fight back. In central New York, state Sen. John Mannion is facing veteran and town councilor Sarah Klee Hood; the winner takes on Rep. Brandon Williams, who Democrats believe they only lost to in 2022 because they keep nominating lousy candidates. Polls close at 9 p.m.\n\nColorado. Rep. Lauren Boebert has shaken up two different races here â in the 3rd Congressional District, which sheâs abandoning after nearly losing in 2022, and in the 4th Congressional District, where sheâs running to replace ex-Rep. Ken Buck. Sheâs not running in the special election to fill Buckâs seat today: Greg Lopez, a businessman, former mayor, and twice-unsuccessful candidate for governor, is the GOP nominee . Democratic activist Trisha Calvarese is the nominee tonight, and seeking the nomination for the November election, where she might face Boebert: Sheâs led in polls and fundraising over six other GOP candidates. In the 3rd District, seven Republicans are running to replace Boebert, and Democrats are quietly pulling for ex-state Rep. Ron Hanks, a 2022 election conspiracy theorist.\n\nThe winner will face Adam Frisch, the Democrat who almost beat Boebert and has continued to raise millions of dollars for his underdog campaign. In the 5th Congressional District, where Rep. Doug Lamborn is retiring, Trump endorsed state party chair Dave Williams, who some county Republican parties wanted to depose after he called to âburn all pride flags.â Heâs been outspent by radio host Jeff Crank, who also has the support of Americans for Prosperity â which endorsed Nikki Haley over Trump this cycle. Polls close at 7 p.m. local time, 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nUtah. Trumpâs influence will be tested again here, in a state where his grip on the Republican imagination is weaker than usual. Heâs endorsed Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs to replace retiring Sen. Mitt Romney, helping Staggs win the delegate vote at the state GOP convention. But polling conducted as mail ballots went out found a substantial lead for Rep. John Curtis. Gov. Spencer Cox, who was booed at the same state convention, faces a challenge from his right: State Rep. Phil Lyman, who questioned the integrity of the 2020 election, and subsequently was pardoned by Trump for his role in an ATV protest on federal land. Polls close at 8 p.m. local time, 10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nLauren Boebert for Congress, âOur Way of Life.â It can be tricky to run for re-election in a district you donât live in. Boebertâs conservative celebrity status, and her Trump endorsement, have smoothed over her âcarpetbaggerâ problem, and her paid media portrays her as a champion for all of rural Colorado â the west that she represents now, the east that sheâs running in. âShe will fight the radical environmentalists, defend our Second Amendment, and protect our way of life,â says a pro-Boebert rancher.\n\nSherri Biggs for Congress, âTelevangelist.â Pastor Mark Burns endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2016, telling his own ( somewhat inflated ) conversion story across the country â heâd voted for Barack Obama, but now heâd found a candidate who could really save the country. The Obama vote haunted Burns in prior runs for Congress, and Biggs uses it now to close out her campaign: Burns, she said, voted for a âgun-grabbingâ Democrat, while she fought to defend the Second Amendment.\n\nCori Bush for Congress, âSt. Louis Not for Sale.â The left has spent two years making an argument that it hopes can neutralize AIPAC spending in their races â that the pro-Israel group is funded in part by Trump donors, who donât deserve to pick Democratic nominees. Jamaal Bowman has hit that theme throughout his primary, and Bush is on the air with it in St. Louis, warning that âDonald Trump and Josh Hawleyâs donorsâ are backing primary opponent Wesley Bell.\n\nThe problem: Voters continue to blame Joe Biden for inflation. The solution, from the Democratic strategists at Blueprint : Blame corporate avarice for inflation, even if the political press scoffs. âItâs such a good contrast to Trump,â Blueprint lead pollster Evan Roth Smith told Americana. He cited one of last weekâs strangest stories, when Trump told the wealthy hosts of the âAll-Inâ podcast that he favored green cards for all foreign college graduates, a position his campaign immediately walked back. âTrump walks into a room with rich people, and does their bidding,â Roth Smith said. âYou can tell that story.â\n\nBiden won Georgia in 2020 with an unstable coalition and some luck â a majority of independent voters, 88% of Black voters, and a sizable protest vote for the Libertarian nominee. Heâs trailing Trump now in large part because his share of the Black vote has slipped, down to 70%, and because more independents now choose a third-party candidate. Most voters are troubled by Trumpâs felony convictions, but a critical share of those voters pick a non-Biden option.\n\nWhite House. The president and his predecessor are prepping for Thursdayâs debate in Atlanta, and for the third consecutive election cycle, Donald Trump is demanding a drug test for his opponent.\n\nIn 2016, Trump called on Hillary Clinton to be tested before their final debate, because he thought her energy flagged at their first two. âShe could barely reach her car,â he explained, referring to a damaging pre-debate incident when Clinton struggled to leave a 9/11 commemoration event while suffering from pneumonia. In 2020, Trump demanded a drug test for Biden, based on his personal assessment that the Democrat was âunevenâ during primary debates.\n\nThis year, Trump has made the same demand, but gotten more help than ever before from the rest of the GOP. âWe all know Joe Biden is hiding at Camp David getting drugged up for the big debate Thursday night,â read a fundraising appeal from the GOPâs House campaign committee. âWe anticipate that for this first debate he will be on something,â Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks told Fox News. Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson â like Miller-Meeks, a licensed physician â sent a letter to the White House, saying that a test should be âadministered both immediately before and after the debate and should include, but not be limited to, performance enhancing drugs.â\n\nIn New Jersey, election lawyer Scott Salmon sued to remove Robert F. Kennedy from the ballot, questioning whether Kennedyâs decision to run as an independent after faltering in the Democratic Party violated the stateâs âsore loserâ law. Kennedy, wrote Salmon, won âhundreds, if not thousands, of write-in votes in the primary election.â Four years ago, Salmon sued Kanye West off the ballot by challenging his signatures, but Kennedy submitted far more than the 800 signatures necessary for access.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "âItâs disgustingâ: Progressives seethe after Mondaire Jones backs Jamaal Bowman challenger\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHouse progressives raged against former colleague Mondaire Jones after he endorsed Rep. Jamaal Bowmanâs primary opponent George Latimer.\n\nâI am appalled,â Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. said.\n\nIn backing Latimer, Jones accused Bowman in a New York Times interview of causing âpain and anxietyâ among his Jewish constituents with his rhetoric criticizing Israel. Democratic donors and groups supportive of Israel have poured millions into unseating Bowman this cycle. Jones, meanwhile, faces a competitive race to unseat Republican Rep. Mike Lawler.\n\nBoth Jones and Bowman were elected in 2020, when a new, diverse slate of left-leaning Democrats headlined by fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were ascendant in the House. Some of Bowmanâs allies on the left took the move against him personally.\n\nâItâs disgusting,â said Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., who also faces a well-funded primary challenge this cycle. âIs that who he wants to be? Someone that the members canât even trust? Someone that the members know will be your friend one day, and then as soon as itâs beneficial to him, will completely not only turn on you, but will go and support the person that is challenging you?â\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Penn. called the endorsement âincredibly disappointing.â\n\nâHere we have a former CPC and CBC member whoâs endorsing against both a Progressive and Black man who was the first Black man in his seat,â she said. âSo it couldnât be me. But I think and I hope that people will look at that for what that is.â\n\nReached for comment by Semafor, Jones said in a statement that he has âa longstanding relationship with Georgeâ and that he is âmaking this endorsement to stand up for my Jewish constituents because Rep. Bowman and I have deeply different views on Israel.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nJones is in a tough position. Turning on Bowman could bolster his campaign against Lawler, a moderate who is also backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, but at the risk of a break with his former Democratic colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. It would make for an especially awkward reunion in the House if Bowman and Jones both win their respective races.\n\nLawler scoffed when I asked him if heâd heard about the recent endorsement. He noted that Jones had previously said âwe need more people like Bowman in Congressâ in 2020. That quote has featured prominently in Lawlerâs campaign material, a sign of the pressure Jones is facing to distance himself from Bowman.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "FBI Director Chris Wray is testifying today. Hereâs what to expect.\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray will appear before the House Judiciary Committee to answer questions about the âpoliticizationâ of the federal government, where heâll face some of his most ardent critics â including at least one member who has cosponsored a bill to impeach him.\n\nWrayâs appearance comes after Chairman Jim Jordan issued a subpoena in connection with a withdrawn FBI memo related to extremism in the Catholic Church, but the hearing is expected to touch on many other topics. Hereâs what might come up, based on conversations with Republicans and Democrats.\n\nIn this article:\n\nâFireworks,â Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La. told Semafor when asked what the public can expect from Republicans. âHeâs got a lot to answer for.â\n\nCommittee members are expected to grill Wray on Hunter Bidenâs plea deal to resolve tax issues and a gun charge after two IRS officials claimed the Justice Department slow-walked the investigation (the Trump-appointed Delaware prosecutor overseeing the case, David Weiss, recently disputed some of their claims). The committee also plans to question Wray on special counsel John Durhamâs report, which criticized the FBIâs probe into the 2016 Trump campaignâs ties to Russia.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. said many Republican committee members are interested in bringing up the court case that recently resulted in a federal judge blocking the Biden administration from communicating with certain social media companies about preventing misinformation.\n\nJordan on Tuesday penned a letter to the House Appropriations Committee calling for eliminating funding for a new FBI building and examining potential locations outside the D.C. area. (Jordan has suggested moving the bureau headquarters not to Maryland or Virginia but to Alabama .)\n\nOne Democratic aide speculated that it would be a âhearing of unfounded grievances.â\n\nExpect Democrats to play defense by framing the hearing as a vehicle to defend former President Donald Trump and delegitimize investigations into domestic extremists. There will be a push to highlight Republicansâ growing effort to defund federal law enforcement agencies, which has become more relevant as some Republicans float the idea of using the Holman Rule to zero out specific government workersâ wages.\n\nRepublicans also arenât the only ones with concerns about the FBIâs treatment of activists. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo. told Semafor sheâll be asking Wray about the FBIâs handling of protesters and referenced a report about the agency hiring a media surveillance firm that labeled activists âthreat actorsâ in 2015. âI am an activist from the movement,â she said.\n\nFacts First USA, the progressive outfit run by David Brock, said it plans to do rapid response to the hearing to counter the notion that Wray, who was appointed by Trump to lead the bureau in 2017, and Weiss would lead a biased investigation into Bidenâs son. âJordan attacking federal law enforcement is nothing new, heâs spent almost the last ten years crying wolf about the FBI and DOJ,â a new memo circulated by the group reads.\n\nWray will use his opening remarks to champion the work of the FBIâs nearly 40,000 employees on everything from countering drug cartels trafficking fentanyl to investigations into Chinese government attempts to steal trade secrets. âThe work the men and women of the FBI do to protect the American people goes way beyond the one or two investigations that seem to capture all the headlines,â he will say, according to an excerpt of his prepared remarks.\n\nBut donât expect Wray to say too much about the federal classified documents case against Trump, given that itâs in the purview of the special counselâs office. The Justice Department generally avoids commenting on ongoing investigations or cases.\n\nThere may be some rare consensus around the basic concept of reforming Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which will expire at the end of the year if Congress does not reauthorize it. The controversial program permits the intelligence agencies to collect communications data on foreign suspects abroad without a warrant, but also results in incidental collection on Americans who are in touch with those foreigners.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have concerns about the governmentâs potential overreach that could yield a deal but some on the right have suggested the program be done away with entirely based on their lack of faith in the FBI to fairly run it. Gaetz introduced a resolution Tuesday calling on Congress to allow the program to expire.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"
