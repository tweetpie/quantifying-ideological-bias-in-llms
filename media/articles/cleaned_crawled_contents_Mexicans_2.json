      "text": "'Bomb the Mexicans' is the GOP's new 'build the wall': columnist\n\nCalls for U.S. attacks on Mexican drug cartels, recently discussed in secret if at all, have become a loudly expressed talking point for Republicans who are trying to exploit the violent rhetoric for political gain, columnist Jean Guerrero wrote for The Miami Herald Thursday.\n\nGuerrero notes that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' recent promises to deploy the military against drug cartels, along with his support for executing smugglers and his assertion that \"you absolutely can use deadly force,\" typify a new tone DeSantis and other Republican presidential candidates have struck in recent months that makes \"Build the Wall\" seem quaint by comparison.\n\nGuerrero writes that \"Republican politicians are now expressing their bloodlust in public. As 'Build the Wall' loses its edge, 'Bomb the Mexicans' is becoming mainstream in the GOP.\"\n\nDeSantis isn't alone, Guerrero writes, noting that Donald Trump has called for attacking the cartels \"just like we took down ISIS.\"\n\nGuerrero contends that Republicans aren't making a good faith argument, and that their rhetoric has more to do with racism than finding solutions to the ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nGuerrero writes that \"The idea exploits the grief of tens of thousands of Americans who've lost loved ones to fentanyl, sometimes made in Mexico with chemicals from China. Republican bills in Congress seek to authorize military force in Mexico. Other legislation would designate cartels in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations or classify fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.\"\n\n\"No politician has proposed bombing the U.S. corporations behind thousands of opioid-related deaths, but why would they? To rally American support for state violence, bloodmongers need racism.\"\n\nGuerrero notes that Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) has warned that such proposals could serve to lay the groundwork for a potential Mexican invasion.\n\nGuerrero writes that \"If Americans understood the economic realities of what drives drug trafficking and migration from the region - including the role U.S. corporations play in propping up corrupt local elites - they wouldn't be advocating for more bloodshed. But Republican politicians aren't interested in finding solutions for reducing migrants or for families harmed by opioid addiction. They're into political gain, by any means necessary.\"\n\nRead the full article here ."

      "text": "Mexicans Rolled Out the Unwelcoming Carpet to Trump Before His Visit\n\nUnder the hashtags \"you are not welcome here\" and \"Trump with all respect\" Mexicans have been excoriating the Republican nominee for U.S. president with remarks both humorous and hateful, in anticipation of the billionaire developer's visit Wednesday in Mexico City with President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto.\n\n(Translation: \"#MrTrumpwithallrespect Can I have your autograph on my visa?\")\n\nTrump has famously described Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" and has pledged to build a wall on the U.S. southern border and require Mexico pay for it, in part by blocking remittances sent by undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. until the government picked up the tab.\n\n(Translation: #MrTrumpwithallrespect You don't speak spanish and Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto don't speak English, so why you're coming? We could rape you...)\n\nBeginning to lose pace in the polls against his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, Trump will deliver an immigration address Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump decided to accept PeÃ±a Nieto's invitation sent both to him and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nHillary, for her part, has not yet accepted the invitation but has criticized Trump's visit, saying it will not change anything about what he has previously said about the country or its people. Meanwhile, academics, politicians, intellectuals and all kinds of personalities in Mexico have also joined the discussion on social media expressing dissatisfaction about the visit of Trump.\n\n\"Listen @realDonaldTrump, we Mexicans expect nothing less than an apology for calling us 'criminals and rapists,'\" said the renowned historian Enrique Krauze. \"I propose to say out Enrique out Trump, these two idiots symbolize everything that is wrong with North America.\" Said the analyst John Ackerman."

      "text": "Mitt Romney Disses Palestinians, Mexicans -- Who's Next?\n\nIn Mitt Romney's \"Guide to Running for President,\" the chapter on foreign travel is very short: \"Open mouth. Insert foot.\" That's it.\n\nRomney made his latest outrageous remark in Jerusalem, where he seriously asserted that Israelis (and clearly he meant Jews, since he was sucking up to a Jewish audience) are wealthier than Palestinians because \"culture makes all the difference.\" He learned this, he said, from reading \"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations,\" a book by Harvard professor David Landes.\n\nI'll confess that I haven't read the book. All I had to do was read the blurbs on Amazon.com . That was enough. Nations get wealthy, Landes contends, because their culture emphasizes \"work, thrift, honesty, patience, tenacity, open-mindedness and a commitment to democracy.\" (Cultural explanations of poverty have been pretty well debunked .)\n\nAnd hey, Landes should know. \"this had been his study for his entire life -- and he's in his early 70s at this point,\" Romney told the audience in Jerusalem, who must have been delighted to hear that Jews have all these admirable qualities, but Palestinians don't, and that's why Palestinians are so poor.\n\nIn other words, Jews bear no responsibility for Palestinians' poverty, even though the Jewish state's army has been occupying and dominating Palestine for 45 years. It's all the Palestinians' own fault. They're lazy, dishonest, impulsive, wasteful, close-minded, and don't care about democracy. That was the clear implication of Romney's words.\n\nRomney didn't explain how the occupiers get to be the beacon of democracy, while the occupied, who resist in the name of self-determination, become enemies of democracy. Nor did he explain why he's unaware of the long-standing Israeli policy of crippling the Palestinian economy -- a policy that has made the economic inequity between the two lands much greater than the numbers Romney offered.\n\nBut there's good news as well as bad news here. The good news is that Romney's clear display of ignorance and bias is news. When I checked, Google News had logged 4,924 articles on Mitt's latest symptom of foot-in-mouth disease, and a large portion of them were from U.S. media sources.\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when words like his, even from a presidental candidate, would have gone largely unnoticed. In the U.S., Racial and ethnic stereotyping of this kind as been so common among white Americans for so long that, until relatively recently, no mass media outlets would have even noticed it. The cultural inferiority of \"undeveloped\" peoples was simply taken for granted. The fact that such old-fashioned bias is now big news is certainly encouraging.\n\nThe bad news side is a longer list. Let's start with the unbelievable way Romney's campaign tried to justify his remarks. This really happened, according to the New York Times :\n\n\"After Mr. Romney's remarks drew criticism, his campaign said that the Associated Press had 'grossly mischaracterized' the remarks by not providing the full context. For instance, the campaign said, after mentioning the per capita G.D.P. of Israel and Palestine, Mr. Romney also said: 'And that is also between other countries that are near or next to each other. Chile and Ecuador, Mexico and the United States.'\"\n\nYes, folks, in the ethnic/racial gospel according to Romney, Mexicans are just as lazy, dishonest, impulsive, wasteful, and close-minded as Palestinians. Part of the bad news is that this egregious anti-Mexican slur got so little news coverage.\n\nAre the mass media less concerned about biased stereotyping of Mexicans than Palestinians? Or was the anti-Mexican slur overlooked just because U.S. - Mexican relations don't have the same emotional punch as the blood-soaked Israeli-Palestinian conflict? I don't know.\n\nBut I do know that, despite the improved media sensitivity to the Palestinians' plight, this kind of ethnic stereotyping is still far too alive and well in the United States. On the same day it reported Romney's gaffe, the New York Times ran (just by coincidence?) an article on the Palestinians' efforts to boost their high-tech industries and the obstacles they face: \"About 2,000 Palestinians graduate from local universities each year in technical subjects, one-third to one-half of them women, but only about 30 percent of them find work in the local industry.\"\n\nWhy so little work for these well-qualified graduates? foreigners are reluctant to invest in Palestine, writes the Times ' Isabel Kirshner, largely because \"the image the world has of the territory as a volatile conflict zone where people ride to work on camels.\" In Mexico, of course, it's donkeys. But how much difference would that make to Mitt and his friends in the investment capital world?\n\nContinuing with the bad news: Romney did not ascribe Israel's relative wealth only to the Jews' virtuous character. He added \"the hand of providence\" and the Jews' religious faith -- implying that the Palestinians' lack religion and that God doesn't really care much about them.\n\nWhich brings us to the worst news of all: This guy might very well become president of the United States next January and represent the nation to the whole world for four long, agonizing years. Where else will he see \"the hand of providence\"?\n\nAnd who will he diss next, keeping alive the old American tradition of ascribing simplistic, bigoted character traits to whole nations, races, and ethnic groups -- with white America always coming out Number One on the virtue scale? many of us thought that this shameful but prominent piece of the fabric of American life was fast disappearing. We may well be wrong. We'll get a big clue on Election Day."

      "text": "Trump's war on migrants could make an enemy of the country he needs most\n\nOn his first day in office, Donald Trump launched his second term with a barrage of executive orders . Unsurprisingly, many could have a major impact on Mexico, which shares a 3,145-kilometre border with the US and more than 200 years of diplomatic and economic ties .\n\nYet, this deep interdependence has not stopped Trump from making Mexico a prime target of his divisive political rhetoric.\n\nHe entered the public arena in 2015 by condemning Mexicans as dangerous \"rapists\" and criminals who were \"bringing drugs\" into the US. He also vowed to build \" a great, great wall \" along the border - one he claimed Mexico would pay for - to stop undocumented immigrants.\n\nDuring his second presidential campaign, Trump doubled down on his anti-Mexico rhetoric and agenda. He threatened mass deportations of undocumented migrants residing in the US, sweeping tariffs of over 200% on Mexican vehicle imports and sending special forces into Mexico to attack drug cartels.\n\nTrump's executive orders are now putting these threats into action. Among the most concerning:\n\nThough largely symbolic, the order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America\" further strains bilateral relations.\n\nGiven this focus, Trump's long shadow will loom over Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum 's own time in office. She will have to navigate his hostility while tackling domestic challenges, including a controversial judicial reform plan and relentless violence .\n\nShe has responded to Trump's actions with measured remarks so far :\n\nTrump's declaration of a national emergency allows him to deploy the military to the border and continue building a border wall without Congressional approval. He could also enact measures to expand detention facilities, transportation (including aircraft) and other logistical support for law enforcement.\n\nIllegal border crossings actually declined dramatically in 2024. This was, in part, due to steps Mexican authorities have taken to stop migrants attempting to reach the US.\n\nMexican authorities reported detaining over 475,000 migrants in the last quarter of 2024 - nearly 68% more than in the same period a year earlier.\n\nDespite these efforts - which have drawn criticism for human rights groups - Trump has labelled migrant crossings an \" invasion .\"\n\nThis belligerent rhetoric is dangerous, as an invasion implies military aggression.\n\nIndeed, Trump's executive order authorises the deployment of US troops on the border, though details are thin. He could seek the assistance of the National Guard, a state-based military force made up of civilian soldiers . US law, however, prohibits the use of regular military forces on domestic soil.\n\nIn any case, Mexico serves as a stark example of why using the military for law enforcement is unwise. More than a decade of data shows that military involvement fails to encourage lawful behaviour and instead fuels corruption and violence .\n\nTrump has also initiated the process to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations - an action Mexico has long opposed.\n\nCombined with his directive for the US secretary of defence to halt \"the unimpeded flow of opiates\" across the Mexico-US border, this could ultimately lead to US military action against organised crime in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum responded by reaffirming Mexico's sovereignty. She noted that while the US can act within its territory, Mexico remains an independent state.\n\nIn a letter to Trump last November, she highlighted that in 2024, Mexican law enforcement seized 10,340 weapons and arrested 15,640 people for drug-related violence. She also correctly pointed out that Mexico neither produces weapons , nor has a national public health crisis linked to synthetic drugs like fentanyl.\n\nYet, she lamented that Mexicans \"bear the brunt of the deaths caused by crime\" driven by the demand for drugs north of the border.\n\nAny unilateral US military action inside Mexico could seriously imperil relations between the two neighbors.\n\nThe last time the US seriously considered military action against Mexico was in 1927, when Mexico enacted petroleum and land laws that affected American interests. Since then, the relationship has had its ups and downs, but has never involved military force.\n\nAnd these kinds of threats could have ripple effects across Latin America. As former Colombian President Ernesto Samper has warned, an intervention in Mexico could spark a \" Vietnam syndrome \" of anti-American sentiment throughout the region.\n\nIn addition, Trump has vowed to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting on February 1.\n\nSuch tariffs, however, could not be implemented without also hurting US industries.\n\nMexico overtook China as the US's top trading partner in 2023 , with bilateral trade reaching US$807 billion (A$1.2 trillion). Mexico's economy relies heavily on trade, with 83% of exports destined for the US.\n\nIn return, Mexico's direct investments in the US totalled US$33.8 billion (A$54 billion) in 2022 - an impressive 21.5% increase over the previous year.\n\nThe Mexican and US economies are tightly intertwined. If Trump imposes tariffs on Mexican beer, for example, he will also be imposing them on barley from Idaho, Montana and North Dakota that's used to make the beer.\n\nSheinbaum has accurately warned Trump that tariffs are not just unacceptable under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement - they will also result in \"inflation and job losses\" across both the US and Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum has advised Mexicans to \" keep their heads cool \".\n\nBut as Trump continues to exert pressure on Mexico, it will become increasingly difficult for her to convince the Mexican public of the benefits of maintaining a cooperative relationship with the US.\n\nThe potential deterioration of relations between Mexico and the US could signal a new era in which brute force, paradoxically, will diminish American influence in the international community.\n\nLuis Gómez Romero , Senior Lecturer in Human Rights, Constitutional Law and Legal Theory, University of Wollongong\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "How Mexico is transforming after a year of leftist government\n\nby Sergio Daniel Michel Chavez , Carleton University\n\nA year ago, the first leftist president in Mexico's modern history took office.\n\nThe victory of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly referred to as AMLO in Mexico, swept aside a long-standing political establishment in a society where most politicians are seen as corrupt and detached from the reality of ordinary citizens.\n\nLópez Obrador's victory not only threatened the entrenched political and economic interests that dominated Mexican politics for decades, it also came as a reprieve to an embattled left in Latin America at a time when right-wing forces were on the rise.\n\nThe transformative project of the new government, dubbed Mexico's \"Fourth Transformation,\" has promised to break with the neoliberal model that had turned the country into the most unequal among OECD nations . This has meant a drastic change in policy priorities.\n\nUnder López Obrador, the government no longer promotes investment and job creation at any price. Instead, it announced the largest increase to the minimum wage in 36 years , passed a major labour reform strengthening workers' rights and ended decades of discretionary tax breaks to large corporations . These measures have unsettled some economic elites, who are now hesitant to invest in a country that is changing the rules of the game.\n\nLópez Obrador seems aware that the surly relations between the government and the private sector can hinder his transformative agenda. Despite his campaign promise of a four per cent annual growth, the economic scenario in Mexico is daunting. As the country struggles to avoid recession, rating agencies and international organizations are lowering their outlooks for the Mexican economy .\n\nThe rapid ratification of the trade agreement not only sent a message of certainty to domestic and international investors, it also flagged the limits of the AMLO government when it comes to breaking with Mexico's neoliberal past.This is why Mexicans were so prompt to ratify USMCA, a renegotiated version of NAFTA, and its subsequent overhaul , despite the free-trade deal being at odds with López Obrador's anti-neoliberal stance.\n\nA second threat to López Obrador's agenda is the rising levels of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe new administration has been unable to contain a wave of violence that it inherited from its predecessors. In fact, 2019 is on the verge of becoming the deadliest year on record in Mexico . The massacre of the LeBaron family -in which six children and three women were murdered in northern Mexico - and the failed attempt to arrest the son of drug lord El Chapo in Culiacán , where the military was outnumbered by cartel gunmen, are just two examples of the government's incapacity to end the violence.\n\nThe president's \"abrazos, no balazos\" (hugs, not bullets) policy has been harshly criticized for its naiveté and has been largely ineffective.\n\nHowever, one year into leftist rule in Mexico and it's not all bad news. Despite economic woes and enduring violence, López Obrador's government has made considerable progress dismantling a system that almost solely benefits the political and economic elite and keeps more than 50 million Mexicans in poverty .\n\nLópez Obrador started his term by announcing harsh austerity measures to bureaucrats and politicians, including cutting his own salary in half and ditching the presidential mansion, jet and guards.\n\nIn a clear break with the past, his government is prosecuting corrupt officials from previous administrations. Social spending is also being revamped. About 18 million youth and elderly Mexicans are now receiving their scholarships and pensions from social programs as cash transfers.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, López Obrador is transforming the perception of political power in Mexico and how it should be used. At most events he attends, the president finds himself surrounded by supporters who cheer and hug their leader without apparent constraints - in contrast to the strong security measures taken by his predecessors when in public.\n\nWhen asked about his safety, López Obrador confidently replies that it is the people who look after him . Despite his populist tone, he seems to understand that first and foremost, Mexico's marginalized majorities need to be seen and recognized as part of a society that has excluded them for too long.\n\nIf we want to understand the change Mexico is undergoing, we must measure progress with metrics other than the GDP. Only when we gauge it via other methods will we understand the extent to which the political and economic structures that have made Mexico one of the most inequitable countries in the world are being dismantled.\n\nChanging public perceptions about political power might not be as tangible as economic growth and decreasing homicide rates, but its impact on building a more inclusive society are real and every bit as important.\n\n[ You're smart and curious about the world.

      "text": "'Communities were destroyed': Mass deportations of 1930s and 1950s show harm of Trump plan\n\nDonald Trump has made the mass deportation of immigrants a centerpiece of his plans for a second term, vowing to forcibly remove as many as 20 million people from the country. Historian Ana Raquel Minian, who studies the history of immigration, says earlier mass deportation programs in the 1930s and '50s led to widespread abuse, tearing many families apart through violent means that also resulted in the expulsion of many U.S. citizens. \"These deportations that Trump is claiming that he will do will have mass implications to our civil rights, to our communities and to our economy, and of course to the people who are being deported themselves,\" says Minian. She also says that while Trump's extremist rhetoric encourages hate and violence against vulnerable communities, in terms of policy there is great continuity with the Biden administration, which kept many of the same policies in place.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: We end today's show looking at Donald Trump's threat to deport as many as 20 million immigrants living in the United States. It's a threat he repeated on an almost daily basis on the campaign trail, including at the Republican National Convention.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We're joined right now by a historian who's closely studied past mass deportation programs in the United States. Ana Raquel Minian is an associate professor of history at Stanford University and the author of In the Shadow of Liberty: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States Their recent piece for Dissent magazine is titled \"Trump's Deportation Model.\"\n\nSo, Professor Minian, if you can start off by talking about Trump's victory, what that model is, and, you know, his famous motto, \"Make America great again\"? Go back in history and talk about the mass deportations of people in the United States.\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN: Thank you.\n\nIn many ways, we think that Trump is a new model, a person who completely goes against the grain of American history in terms of deportations, in terms of his treatment of immigrants. But as he noted himself, that is absolutely not true.\n\nWhat he was referring to when he spoke about Eisenhower was an operation that occurred in 1954 titled Operation Wetback. And this was a massive deportation campaign. The tactics were military tactics. They brought tanks. They brought Border Patrol people all throughout the border, airplanes. People were grabbed from their houses and taken to the border, stopped outside of their jobs and taken to the border. Their families didn't know where they had been. It was a very cruel operation. In the year 1954, the year of Operation Wetback, over 1 million people were deported. And this is the model that Trump says that he is going to expand.\n\nAnd it comes at huge costs to America, to its communities and to the people themselves. In the United States, when Operation Wetback happened, communities were destroyed. People were left without central members, without churchgoers, without breadwinners. Families came to [inaudible]. Families who relied on some of the folks who were deported had to either rely on welfare or find jobs immediately. Children were left without parents. Many jobs, many employers needed workers who were deported. It was bad for the U.S. economy. It was also bad for American civil rights. Many Mexican Americans, people who were born in the United States, could be walking through the streets and considered to be Mexican just because they, quote-unquote, \"looked Mexican,\" and their civil rights were not protected. Their constitutional rights were not protected.\n\nThe deportation of American citizens is something that we have seen over and over again. For example, in the 1930s, there was also a massive deportation campaign against Mexicans. It occurred, of course, during the Great Depression. We estimate that from 350,000 to a million people were deported and that over 60% of those were American citizens. These deportations that Trump is claiming that he will do will have mass implications to our civil rights, to our communities and to our economy, and of course to the people who are being deported themselves.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And if you could explain? If you could put that in the context of more recent history? In other words, how does Trump's proposal - or, in fact, what is actual policies that he implemented in the four years he was in power, from 2016 - on immigration, how do they compare with what the Biden administration did and what Kamala Harris said herself, since it was also central to her, immigration border security was also central to her campaign?\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN: Absolutely. In many ways, the Biden administration also led an extremely anti-immigrant movement. His administration first continued the \"return to Mexico\" policy, continued Title 42. What did these policies do? These policies meant that either asylum seekers could not even apply for asylum in the United States, even though asylum is something that we abide to because of our own national law and because of international agreements, and it said that - and the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy said that if we were to accept asylum seekers to apply for asylum, they had to wait while their cases were adjudicated in northern Mexico. While people waited in northern Mexico for either Title 42 to go away or for the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy to be allowed in, people lived in terrible encampments where they were regularly raped, tortured, mugged. It was absolutely brutal, the conditions there. In fact, I once interviewed a woman who had fostered a child during Trump's zero-tolerance policy, the policy that Trump implemented that separated children from their parents while in detention. And this woman, who had fostered one of these little kids who was separated from his father while crossing the border because of the Trump administration, said, \"Right now the Biden administration's 'Remain in Mexico' policy is basically a zero-tolerance policy in reverse.\" Why? The conditions in northern Mexico were so brutal that some parents made the heart-wrenching decision of sending their children across the border, because unaccompanied minors were the only ones who could get into the United States while their parents had to wait in northern Mexico. Even recently, the Biden campaign has dramatically reduced the number of asylum seekers who can come into the country. These policies have been devastating to asylum seekers and migrants.\n\nBut there is, I believe, a big difference between what Trump did and what Biden did, even if not so much numerically. The rhetoric that Trump implemented, the anti-immigrant discourse, calling Mexicans \"animals,\" all Central Americans as belonging to MS-13, calling people rapists, that is not something that we heard so much from the Biden administration or from Kamala Harris's campaign. And that rhetoric matters. That rhetoric leads to violence in Latino communities, and eventually it also pushes people, administrations, to move further and further toward anti-immigrant policies. Additionally, Trump's family separation policy was explicitly created for purposes of deterrence. What does this mean? Trump implemented the zero-tolerance policy to cause harm to asylum seekers in order to warn other asylum seekers not to try to come into the United States. The very purpose of this policy was to cause harm. This is different from the policies that Biden has implemented and that Kamala Harris promised to implement, as well, even though they, too, would have created massive harm.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And if you could say, given all of that, especially what you said the distinctions are between Kamala and Biden and Trump - you know, so many exit polls have found, across the board, there was an increase in the number of votes for Trump, and obviously Latinx community is a massive and highly diverse community, but among this community, however defined, there was also an increase in the number of people who voted for Trump. How do you understand that?\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN: I do want to emphasize your first point, which is: Why are we even thinking of a Latinx community when we think of votes? We know, for example, that Cubans have regularly voted Republican, that Mexicans have switched back and forth. So, I have been a little disturbed by this concept of a Latinx community and the blame that has been put on this community for the election of Trump nowadays.\n\nBut there is a history that we must understand. For example, if we look at the Mexican American community, right now the biggest Latinx community is of Mexicans. And Mexicans have changed - Mexican Americans have changed their views around migration many times. Up until the 1970s, most Mexican Americans viewed immigrants as a huge problem. Why? When immigrants arrived in the United States, they were cast as bringing disease, bringing crime - just like nowadays. And so, Mexican Americans had an option. One of these options was to say, \"Look, we are not them. We don't want them here. If they don't come, we won't be stereotyped as criminals. We won't be stereotyped as bringing in disease. Stop them from coming.\" So this was a very common speech and rhetoric of the Mexican American community up until the 1970s. This type of rhetoric began to change -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We have 10 seconds.\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN: - because of the civil rights movement - because of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, when Mexican Americans said, \"Actually, these people are our brethren. We are still being discriminated. Instead of stopping their discrimination - instead of fighting for them not to come, let us say they should not be discriminated, either.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ana Raquel Minian, we have to leave it there, and we thank you so much for being with us, associate professor of history at Stanford University, author of In the Shadow of Liberty: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States .

      "text": "Why so many Latino voters supported Donald Trump\n\nFor many observers of the 2024 US presidential election, Donald Trump's ability to harness so much of the Latino vote remains one of the more puzzling issues. Latino voters - men in particular - swung decisively towards Trump last November: increasing by 16 points from 2016 to 42% of the bloc in 2024.\n\nThis despite Trump's consistent history of antagonistic remarks about Latino immigrants. It also appears to fly in the face of the fact that his policies on tariffs, border militarisation and mass deportations will likely affect Mexico, Panama and several other Latin American countries.\n\nClearly, Latinos swung towards Trump for the same reason many other voters did. Many were unhappy with the economy (particularly inflation). There was also widespread anxiety about a marked increase in immigration at the southern border.\n\nBut there are more profound reasons driving the dramatic shift in the Latino vote. A closer look at some of the historical dynamics that have shaped the Latino electorate gives a clue for the reason behind this seeming paradox.\n\nThe Latino vote comprises about 14.7% of all eligible US voters. Yet it is far from a monolith . It is a heterogeneous group of people who trace their roots to Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the rest of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nEach of these countries has a different political landscape. They are made up of vastly different people with a different background and distinct cultures. And these differences shape disparate Latino identities in the United States. The term \"Latino\" itself is a blanket term. It can include extremely different populations: Afro-Dominicans in the Bronx, white Cubans in Miami, indigenous Mexicans in Los Angeles, mestizo Salvadorans in Washington DC and a vast array of others.\n\nEven within these national groups, there are also significant divisions. Partly, this is based on a person's time of arrival in the US. Mexican-Americans whose families immigrated to California from border cities like Chihuahua and Ciudad Juárez in the early 1940s as seasonal (and legal) agricultural workers will have different experiences and priorities than Mexicans who arrived more recently from the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca and settled in New York City without any legal pathway to citizenship. Meanwhile, Nicaraguan-American families who arrived in Miami in the 1980s fleeing the Sandinista revolution will have a different economic outlook from those escaping Daniel Ortega's current dictatorship.\n\nThere's no such thing as a generic \"Latino\" voter. The Latino population in the US needs to be understood as a heterogeneous one, made up of people with different experiences, priorities and preferences.\n\nFor many decades, Latinos were reliable Democratic voters - and many pundits predicted that they would stay that way, tipping the political scales decisively away from the Republican Party. But there has always been a strong strain of Latino conservatives voting Republican.\n\nReligion plays a key role here. The majority of people of Latino heritage are Catholic. But there is a growing population of Evangelicals and other Christian denominations, reflecting a growth of those groups in some Latin American countries .\n\nIn El Salvador, for example, the rise of Evangelical religions has produced an increasingly culturally conservative population, who support the \"mano dura\" (strong hand) policies of Nayib Bukele . A similar trend can be found among Latino communities in the US, where Latino Evangelicals strongly supported Trump in 2024 .\n\nThe political history of many Latin American countries is a clue to the make-up for migrants to the US. Mexico's Cristero War in the 1920s prompted thousands of Catholics to flee the country's anti-clerical government by migrating northwards. Three decades later, the Cuban revolution of 1959 produced large refugee flows of conservative and anticommunist migrants. These exiled groups - most notably, Cubans in South Florida - would ally with Republicans based on their punitive policies towards Cuba. This has helped turn Florida into a Republican stronghold .\n\nMore recently, 7 million Venezuelans fled the left-wing government of Nicolás Maduro. This has led to a more general antipathy among many Latino voters towards left-wing politics and politicians. Trump's condemnation of Maduro and Venezuela has endeared him to politically conservative Latino voters of all national backgrounds.\n\nInterestingly, it was also clear that some Latino voters are suspicious and resentful of newer waves of migrants, particularly recent asylum-seekers from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\n\nThis dynamic between earlier arrivals and new immigrants is nothing new in the US. Earlier waves of immigrants and their descendants, such as Irish or Italian immigrants, also adopted nativist attitudes towards newer arrivals. In some ways, each generation of immigrants has tried to \"pull up the bridge\" to the generation that comes after them.\n\nYet these negative reactions also relate to racial and class hierarchies both within and between Latin American countries. Like the US, Latin American countries have a long history of racism and colour discrimination , as well as deep class divides and very high rates of income inequality .\n\nNew immigrants who have arrived in recent years from places such as Venezuela , Honduras , Cuba and Nicaragua are poorer than earlier generations of immigrants - and often have darker skin. As a result, cultural divides may impede a strong sense of solidarity between earlier generations of Latino immigrants and recent arrivals.\n\nThis is not to suggest that racism and classism are the dominant drivers behind Latino support for Trump. But it may help explain why Trump's campaign comments about recent Latino immigrants were not a dealbreaker for every Latino voter.\n\nUltimately, the Latino Trump supporter may not represent such a paradox after all. The so-called \"Latino voter\" is really a multiethnic , diverse bloc of people. While they share common linguistic and cultural features, Latinos are also motivated by a wide variety of religious, political and cultural factors that can be traced back to their own or their families' experiences in Latin America.\n\nThe Latino vote is complex. Politicians who want to win their support would do well to understand how these complicated identities inform their political decisions and allegiances. It appears at the moment the Republicans are doing this better than their Democratic rivals.\n\nJulia Young , Associate Professor, History, Catholic University of America and Gema Kloppe-Santamaría , Lecturer in Sociology, University College Cork\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Faced with Trump's tariffs, Mexico is weighing retaliatory options\n\nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum speaks during a press conference a day after the U.S. elections, at the National Palace, in Mexico City, Mexico, November 6, 2024. REUTERS/Raquel Cunha/File Photo\n\nDonald Trump has made clear his intent to supercharge his \" America First \" approach to foreign policy in his second term - and Mexico looks set to be at the tip of the spear.\n\nWhile many of Trump's predecessors have also followed a \" realist\" strategy - that is, one where relative power is at the forefront of international relations, while diplomatic success is viewed through how it benefits one's own nation - the incoming president has displayed an apparent unwillingness to consider the pain that his plans would inflict on targeted countries or the responses this will engender.\n\nTrump's proposed policies threaten Mexico in three key ways: First, his goal of deporting millions of migrants would put tremendous pressure on Mexico's economy and society as the country tried to absorb the influx. This would be exacerbated by his second threat, a sharp increase in tariffs , which could devastate the critical export sector of Mexico's economy. And third, Trump has floated the idea of using U.S. military power to confront narcotraffickers within Mexico, which would directly impinge on Mexico's sovereignty and could generate more violence on both sides of the border.\n\nBut as a scholar of Latin American politics and U.S.-Latin American relations , I see several options that Mexico could use to push back on Trump by imposing  high costs on U.S. interests.\n\nIndeed, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has already signaled how she may counter Trump's policies. The most obvious tools are ending cooperation on drugs and immigration and imposing tariffs of her own. She could also revoke some of the decades-old tax and labor privileges that have benefited U.S. businesses operating within Mexico. And finally, she could play the \"China card\" - that is, in the face of worsening U.S.-Mexico ties, Mexico could turn to Washington's biggest economic rival at a time when Beijing is seeking to assert more influence across Latin America.\n\nOf course, a worsening relationship is not inevitable.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Mexico's then-president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, maintained a constructive relationship with the U.S. administration. In fact, Lopez Obrador was surprisingly cooperative given Trump's at times hostile rhetoric toward Mexico. For example, he helped facilitate the Trump administration's \" Remain in Mexico \" program for those seeking asylum in the U.S. and also accepted Trump's demands to renegotiate NAFTA and give it a title reflecting U.S. leadership: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement , or USMCA.\n\nSheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, 2024 , started with a cautious approach to her relationship with Trump.\n\nShe congratulated Trump on his victory and urged dialogue with the incoming U.S. president . \"There will be good relations with the United States. I'm convinced of that,\" she told reporters on Nov. 7, 2024.\n\nBut Trump hasn't been conciliatory. In addition to talk about dumping millions of immigrants across the border, he announced on social media on Nov. 24 that he would impose a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods - a move that would effectively abrogate the USMCA.\n\nThat post seemingly ended Sheinbaum's cautious approach. In a strongly worded response , the Mexican president cautioned that she would respond in kind. A trade war, she noted, would harm the economies of both countries; progress on immigration and drug trafficking required cooperation, not threats, she added.\n\nSheinbaum has said she wants to avoid a trade war , but Trump's threats have led her nonetheless to talk about how a trade war would begin. This trade war, plus other costs Sheinbaum could impose on U.S. investors, would also likely foment a coalition of opposition within the U.S. business community - a group that has been a key ally of Trump .\n\nTrump's stated goal of putting high tariffs on goods coming from Mexico is to encourage businesses that currently exploit lower employment costs in Mexico to relocate to the northern side of the border. But that approach ignores the impact that retaliatory tariffs and investment controls would have on U.S.-based companies that rely on the Mexican market. It would have several negative effects.\n\nFirst,  a tit-for-tat tariff war would generate inflation for U.S. and Mexican consumers.\n\nSecond, it would disrupt the integration of markets across North America. As a result of the elimination of tariffs - a key component of both NAFTA and the Trump-era USMCA - markets and the production of goods across North America have become highly interconnected . The trade treaties severely reduced barriers to investment in Mexico, allowing significant American investment in sectors such as agriculture and energy - where U.S. companies were formerly prohibited. Further, manufacturers now rely on processes in which, for example, the average car crosses the border multiple times during production.\n\nSimilarly, agribusiness has developed symbiotic practices , such that grains, apples and pears are predominantly grown in the United States, while tomatoes, strawberries and avocados are grown in Mexico. Given these processes, the U.S. now exports over US$300 billion of goods and services per year to Mexico, and the stock of U.S. investments in Mexico reached $144 billion in 2023.\n\nIf Trump abrogates the trade deals and imposes tariffs, he might convince investors to spend their next dollars in the U.S. But if Mexico imposes tariffs, business taxes or investment restrictions , what would happen to investors' farms and factories already in Mexico?\n\nPast experience suggests that any disruption to supply chains or U.S. export markets would awaken strong business opposition, as analysts and business groups have already recognized .\n\nTrump is not immune to pressure from U.S. businesses. During his first administration, companies successfully opposed Trump's attempt to close the border , arguing that slowing the flow of immigrants also meant slowing trucks full of goods.\n\nOn the issue of the border and immigration, while Trump has issued threats , Sheinbaum has stressed the importance of cooperation.\n\nCurrently, the Mexican government expends significant resources to patrol its own southern border, not to mention dealing with the many potential migrants who gather in its northern cities.\n\nMexico could demand more support from the U.S. in exchange for this work, plus the costs associated with welcoming back the estimated 4 million Mexicans who are currently in the U.S. without proper documentation.\n\nThe deportation of undocumented immigrants that Trump has repeatedly promised will require other types of cooperation, such as processing border crossings, and Mexico could slow-walk this process. Mexico has already signaled that it will withhold processing of non-Mexicans .\n\nThe two countries have a history of collaboration in addressing the illegal drugs trade - but here too there have also been tensions. Toward the end of Trump's first term, for example, a Mexican general was arrested in the U.S. on drug charges. After a diplomatic uproar, he was returned to Mexico and released.\n\nIn late November, Sheinbaum noted that she and Trump had discussed security cooperation \"within the framework of our sovereignty.\" But Trump's campaign rheotric seemed less concerned with Mexico's sovereignty, floating the idea of sending troops to the border or even deploying them within Mexico to counter narcotraffickers. That would clearly enrage Mexico, with consequences that would extend far beyond a willingness to cooperate on the issues of drug trafficking.\n\nOne country that stands to benefit should U.S.-Mexican relations deteriorate is China - an issue that Mexico could exploit.\n\nChina is now the first or second trading partner with nearly every country in Latin America, including Mexico. The value of U.S.-Mexico trade is over $100 billion a year , but the growth of Chinese imports into Mexico has been limited somewhat by rules-of-origin provisions in NAFTA and the USMCA.\n\nA U.S.-Mexican trade war could weaken or end any incentive to keep Chinese goods out. Further, if the doors to the United States are narrowed through tariffs and hostile rhetoric , China's car parts and financial services would clearly become even more attractive to Mexican businesses. A U.S.-Mexican trade war, in short, would augment Beijing's access to a market on the U.S. border.\n\nIn sum, if Trump goes through with his threats, the result will be costs to consumers and businesses, plus a new opportunity for China. This is likely to foment a coalition of industries, investors, consumers and foreign policy experts concerned with China - many parts of which supported Trump's campaign.\n\nScott Morgenstern , Professor of Political Science, University of Pittsburgh\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

According to a Washington Post story on the recent controversy, \"[Someone] writing in a Reddit thread nearly one month ago , referenced a chant similar to the one on the Sigma Alpha Epsilon bus while discussing initiation at the University of Texas. 'For SAE context,' the person wrote, 'a few buddies of mine told me [this was] their favorite song.\"\n\nThe similar chant is, allegedly, from Phi Gamma Delta (also known as FIJI and Phi Gam), a fraternity with over 120 chapters throughout the US and Canada. The aforementioned Redditor posted a poorly spelled flyer, allegedly from the frat, listing its \"confidential\" rules. These include, \"no being a pussy,\" \"no interracial dating\", \"NO FAGETRY\", and \"no Mexicans.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Phi Gamma Delta has been condemned for racism. Last month, they threw a Border Patrol-themed party where students wore sombreros and construction outfits. Students filed at least nine complaints about the party . However, while the University of Oklahoma suspended SAE for its racist chant, the University of Texas hasn't done anything to discipline Phi Gamma Delta. When a student tweeted at the school's official Twitter page, asking if a statement on the party was to be released, the reply was, \"While the behavior doesn't mirror UT core values, it's within students' right to freedom of speech at private off campus event.\"\n\nThe fraternity's controversies transcend Texas. Last year, the UC Irvine chapter came under fire for hosting a \"Fiji Islander\" party . That incident has a history : in 1987, members of the frat's University of Wisconsin chapter, \"put on blackface and erected a cardboard caricature of a black Fiji islander, complete with bone-deviated septum and exaggerated lips, for a party....\"\n\nThe SAE video has sparked a national discussion regarding the function of fraternities. It remains to be seen what impact these recent developments will have on that debate."

      "text": "We Mexicans Welcome Muslims as the New Public Enemy Number One\n\nHey, Muslims: congrats! You're America's new Mexicans, and it's all gracias to our common enemy, Donald Trump .\n\nLet me explain. Anyone with a brain is rightfully upset by Trump's recent remarks that he wants to ban Muslims from migrating to the United States, never mind that he has extensive business dealings in Muslim countries or that he's also hypocritically professed to love Muslims. Republican presidential candidates are jumping over each other to decry Trump's remarks even as they say there's some truth to Trump's heresies.\n\nMeanwhile, a big part of America hoots and hollers in approval and awaits the next horrid pronouncement. ( Here come the internment camps ).\n\nThanks to all this, Muslims are now public enemy nÃomero uno. Welcome to being a Mexican in the United States.\n\nForgive us for feeling a bit of dÃ©jÃ  vu. After all, he pulled this same type of mierda earlier this year. Remember? That whole thing about Mexicans being rapists and criminals and drug smugglers? Followed by him proclaiming to love Mexico - and the revelation that his jacket line is made there ?\n\nRepublican candidates condemned Trump's anti-Mexican babbling at the time, but then adapted his ideas as their own even as Trump leveled up with even more outlandish proposals, like deporting 11 million undocumented people (read: \" wetbacks \") or building a massive border wall . And a big part of America agrees that it is a good idea .\n\nIt's a natural nadir of race relations in this country that America has finally placed y'all as high as we are in the totem pole of who to hate. After all, we represent the two biggest nightmares of an American psyche that still acts like it just landed in Plymouth Rock: race-mixing for us, a non-Christian background for ustedes.\n\nDon't feel lonely as the hate escalates in the coming year. We Mexicans are here for the ummah. After all, the guidebook Americans will follow to properly loathe Muslims was written long ago to use on us.\n\nThe stereotypes thrown against Muslims - bloodthirsty, invaders, misogynistic, clannish, swarthy, wanting white women, secretive and bent on destroying America - have been developed and deployed against Mexicans for the past 175 years in this country, in print, politics and media.\n\nAnd the government overreach you've had to deal with since the days since 9/11 and will have to undergo even more now is like looking at a high school yearbook for us. Getting pulled aside by TSA? The migra has done that to us at border crossings from San Ysidro, California to McAllen, Texas since the days of Pancho Villa. Scared looks by Americans for your beard or hijab? Talk to any Mexican male with a shaved head about all the valentines police throw their way daily.\n\nClampdown on immigration? Americans have tried to stop us from coming since the days of the Ottoman Empire - and now, of course, the fear is your kind jumping the border with our help . Casting Muslim refugees fleeing from terror back home as sleeper agents? Ask Mexicans fleeing from this decade's narco-violence how dispiriting that is (or our Central American cousins fleeing Reagan-supported death squads during the 1980s).\n\nFear of federal agents swooping up one of your relatives and never bothering to tell you why? That's so ingrained in the minds of Mexicans that I remember a childhood game called \"La Migra\", where someone would yell \"¡La migra!\" and everyone would scatter. That was the game, nothing else, and that was in the 1980s.\n\nBest of all is how the actions of a few idiots in our respective tribes get thrown back at us as indicative of our collective failure as a minority. Already, Americans are asking y'all to police yourselves and stop protecting the \"bad\" Muslims, just like Mexican Americans get asked again and again to fight gangs in our neighborhoods or why don't we improve the chaotic situation in Mexico. Funny how Americans never ask themselves the same thing every time some crazy gringo gets an assault rifle and massacres innocents.\n\nIt's going to get tiresome to defend yourselves, Muslims. So how to deal with being America's new Mexicans? Embrace it. Revel in the fact that millions of Americans are freaked out at everything that you do. Continue to organize and decry demonization at every step, and just roll your eyes at the umpteenth Fox News expert who couldn't tell a falafel from kibbeh the way he can't tell a sweet tamale from a savory one.\n\nMost importantly, it's time we form a Mexican-Muslim alliance. The numbers are there, and the similarities between us are astounding - besides how we both scare Americans.\n\nWe both come in a dazzling array of shades. Like Muslims have converts, Mexicans do as well: just look at all the coeds who like to sport sombreros for frat parties, or chefs who take our culinary traditions and get rich off of them . Spanish has thousands of loan words in Arabic gracias to the Moors, from almohada(pillow) to ojalÃ¡ (hopefully, similar to your insha'Allah) to Donald Trump is Satan (Donald Trump is Satan).\n\nThere's already more than a few Mexican Muslims, just like Muslims are starting to love Mexican food (I've had conversations with one of your finest spokespeople, Council on American-Islamic Relations-Los Angeles chapter head Hussam Ayloush, about great tacos in Orange County). Virgin of Guadalupe? She's part-Mexican and part-Muslim .\n\nLet the Republicans rant - after all, they're going to be the ultimate losers in all this. Like Mexicans, most of the Muslims I know seem natural for that party: fiscally and socially conservative, with a particular affinity for family values. Yet Republicans push us to the Democratic side because they're so obnoxious and clueless and really think we don't belong to this country.\n\nSo, let racism unite us. We Mexicans have been waiting for someone else to bear America's cross of bigotry, and we're more than happy to teach you the ropes--and help with the load. Alliances between Muslim and Chicano students groups have blossomed in recent years, so there's precedent for us to hang out. You brothers and sisters bust out the shawerma (which our al pastor is based on), we cabrones will bring out the goat stew, and let's plot the conquest of America - with love, votes, and a bunch of beautiful brown babies ."

      "text": "Asians Now Outpace Mexicans In Terms of Undocumented Growth\n\nChinese, South Koreans, and Indians among the fastest-growing segments of undocumented immigrants.\n\nSomeone tell Donald Trump that he's picking on the wrong immigrants. Turns out that, since 2000, unauthorized immigration from Asia has grown at rates much faster than from Mexico and Central America. That's according to a new report by the Migration Policy Institute. So Trump will need to amend his ideas for \"securing our nation's borders.\"\n\n(Related article: The three fastest-growing Latino groups will surprise you. )\n\nAt 6 million, Mexicans still represent the majority of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. But the percentage of those arriving has slowed since the recession. During that time, however, Asian unauthorized immigration has increased considerably. From 2000 to 2013, it increased 202 percent, according to the report.\n\nA curious reason for this, says Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of U.S. immigration policy at MPI, and coauthor of the study, is that income in some Asian countries has risen. \"That can be counterintuitive,\" he says, \"since you often think of immigration is something that low-income people do.\"\n\n(Related article: Why the 'illegal' population stopped growing. )\n\nIn the 1990s, the unauthorized population in America doubled from 3.5 to 7 million. It reached its apogee in 2007 at 12.2 million. Then the recession hit.\n\nAs demand for low-skilled, low-wage workers waned, so did the number of those who came to the U.S. and traditionally filled those roles. In greater numbers than any other group, the unauthorized Mexican immigrant population has dropped after the recession.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that the unauthorized immigrant Mexican population is unlikely to return to the high growth rate that it did in the 80s and 90s,\" says Rosenblum.\n\nIn that same time, the number of African unauthorized immigrants doubled. Similarly, the number of unauthorized immigrants from Asia tripled.\n\nWhat happened in that time, Rosenblum says, is that as the economies thrived in places such as China, South Korea, and India, people there could now afford to migrate to the U.S.-both legally and illegally.\n\nFor example, in 1990, there were an estimated 28,000 unauthorized immigrants from India in the U.S. There's now more than 284,000. Those numbers mirror the rising share of legal Indian immigrants coming to the U.S., and also America's growing Indian-American population.\n\nThe Asian countries with the largest growth are India (306 percent), South Korea (249 percent), and China (148 percent) .\n\nIn fact, if stretched back to 1990, India's unauthorized U.S. immigration growth far outpaces any other country's, reaching 914 percent.\n\nAsians now represent about a third of the foreign-born population in America-equal with the Mexican foreign-born population. They also represent 14 percent of the unauthorized population. That number, by the author's own projections, will grow in the coming decade.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nFirst, the political emphasis on securing the U.S.-Mexico border might lose importance-at least in reality, if not in rhetoric.\n\n\"I think we can say that given what we know \"... it probably does receive disproportionate emphasis,\" Rosenblum says. \"It would not be at the top of my to-do list, whether in national security or combating unauthorized immigration.\"\n\nSome countries with the highest unauthorized immigrant growth from 2000 to 2013 are:"

      "text": "The Mexicans and Their Country\n\nON the 21st of December, 1859, General Miramon, at the head of the forces of the Mexican Republic, met an army of Liberals at Colima, and overthrew it. The first accounts of the action represented the victory of the Conservatives to be complete, and as settling the fate of Mexico for the present, as between the parties headed respectively by Juarez and Miramon. Later accounts show that there was some exaggeration as to the details of the action, but the defeat of the Liberals is not denied. It would be rash to attach great importance to any Mexican battle; but the Liberal cause was so depressed before the action at Colima as to create the impression that it could not survive the result of that day. Whether the cause of which Miramon is the champion be popular in Mexico or the reverse, it is certain that at the close of 1859 that chief had succeeded in every undertaking in which he had personally engaged; and our own political history is too full of facts which show that a successful military man is sure to be a popular chief, whatever may be his opinions, to allow of our doubting the effect of victory on the minds of the Mexicans. The mere circumstance that Miramon is personally victorious, while the Liberals achieve occasional successes over their foes where he is not present, will be of much service to him. That \" there is nothing so successful as success \" is an idea as old as the day on which the Tempter of Man caused him to lose Paradise, and to the world's admission of it is to be attributed the decision of nearly every political contest which has distracted society. Miramon may have entered upon a career not unlike to that of Santa Aña, whose early victories enabled him to maintain his hold on the respect of his countrymen long after it should have been lost through his cruelties and his disregard of his word and his oath. All, indeed, that is necessary to complete the power of Miramon is, that some foreign nation should interfere in Mexican affairs in behalf of Juarez. Such interference, if made on a sufficiently large scale, might lead to his defeat and banishment, but it would cause him to reign in the hearts of the Mexicans; and he would be recalled, as we have seen Santa Aña recalled, as soon as circumstances should enable the people to act according to their own sense of right.\n\nBefore considering the probable effect of Miramon's success on the policy of the United States toward Mexico, there is one point that deserves some attention. Which party, the Liberal or the Conservative, is possessed of most power in Mexico ? The assertions made on this subject are of a very contradictory character. President Buchanan, in his last Annual Message, says that the Constitutional government - meaning that of which Juarez is the head - \"is supported by a large majority of the people and the States, but there are important parts of the country where it can enforce no obedience. General Miramon maintains himself at the capital, and in some of the distant provinces there are military governors who pay little respect to the decrees of either government.\" On the other hand, a Mexican writer, a member of the Conservative party, who published his views on the condition of his country just one month before the President's Message appeared, declares that the five Provinces or States in which the authority of Miramon was then acknowledged contain a larger population than exists in the twenty-three States in which it was not acknowledged. Of the local authorities in these latter States he says, - \" It is a great mistake to imagine that they obey the government of Juarez any more than they obey the government of General Miramon, or any further than it suits their own private interest, to obey him. It would be curious to know, for instance, how much of the money collected by these 'local authorities ' for taxes, or contributions, or forced loans, and chiefly at the seaport towns for customhouse duties, goes to the 'national treasury' under the Juarez government.\" In this case, as in many others of a like nature, the truth probably is, that but a very small number of the people feel much interest in the contest, while most of them arc prepared to obey whichever chief shall succeed in it without foreign aid. Of the active men of the country, the majority are now with Miramon, or Juarez would not be shut up in a seaport, with his party forming the mere sea-coast fringe of the nation. All that is necessary to convert him into a national, patriotic ruler is, that a foreign army should be sent to the assistance of his rival; and that such assistance shall be sent to Juarez, President Buchanan has virtually pledged the United States by his words and his actions.\n\nIn his last Message to Congress, President Buchanan dwells with much unction upon the wrongs we have experienced from Mexico, and avers that we can obtain no redress from the Miramon government. \" We may in vain apply to the Constitutional government at Vera Cruz,\" he says, \" although it is well disposed to do us justice, for adequate redress. Whilst its authority is acknowledged in all the important ports and throughout the sea-coasts of the Republic, its power does not extend to the city of Mexico and the States in its vicinity, where nearly all the recent outrages have been committed on American citizens. We must penetrate into the interior before wc can reach the offenders, and this can only be done by passing through the territory in the occupation of the Constitutional government. The most acceptable and least difficult mode of accomplishing the object will be to act in concert with that government.\" He then recommends that Congress should authorize him \"to employ a sufficient military force to enter Mexico for the purpose of obtaining indemnity for the past and security for the future.\" And he expresses the opinion that justice would be done by the Constitutional government; but his faith is not quite so strong as we could wish it to be, as he carefully adds, \" This might be secured in advance by a preliminary treaty.\"\n\nThus has the President pledged the country to help Juarez establish his authority over Mexico, in words sure to be read and heeded throughout America and Europe. His actions have been quite as much to the purpose. He placed himself in communication with Juarez in 1859, and recognized his government to be the only existing government of Mexico as early as April 7th, through our envoy, Mr. McLane. That envoy floats about, having a man-of-war for his home, and ready, it should seem, to receive the government to which he is accredited, in the event of its being forced to make a second sea-trip for the preservation of the lives of its members. As the sole refuge for unpopular European monarchs, at one time, was a British man-of-war, so are feeble Mexican chiefs now compelled to rely for safety upon our national ships.\n\nTo predict anything respecting Mexican affairs would be almost as idle as it would be to assume the part of a prophet concerning American politics ; but, unless Miramon's good genius should leave him, his appearance in Vera Cruz may be looked for at no very distant day, and then we shall have the Juarez government entirely on our hands, to support or to neglect, as may be dictated by the exigencies of our affairs. That base of operations, upon the possession of which President Buchanan has so confidently calculated, would be lost, and could be regained only as the consequence of action as comprehensive and as costly as that which placed Vera Cruz in the hands of General Scott in 1847. If the policy laid down by President Buchanan should be adopted and pursued, war would follow between the United States and Mexico from the triumph of Miramon ; and in that war, we should be a principal, and not the mere ally of one of those parties into which the Mexican people are divided. Logically, war is inevitable from Mr. Buchanan's arguments and General Miramon's victories; but, as circumstances, not logic, govern the actions of politicians, we may possibly behold all Mexico loyal to the young general, and yet not see an American army enter that country. The President declares that in Mexico's \"fate and in her fortune, in her power to establish and maintain a settled government, we have a far deeper interest, socially, commercially, and politically, than any other nation.\" The truth of this will not be disputed ; but suppose that Miramon should establish and maintain a settled government in Mexico, would it not be our duty, and in accordance \" with our wise and settled policy,\" to acknowledge that government, and to seek from it redress of those wrongs concerning which Mr. Buchanan speaks with so much emphasis ? Once in a responsible position, and desirous of having the world's approval of his countrymen's conduct, Miramon might be even more than willing to promise as much as Juarez has already promised, we may presume, in the way of satisfaction. That he would fulfil his promises, or that Juarez would fulfil those which he has made, it would be too much to assert; as neither of them would be able,judging from Mexico's past, to maintain himself long in power.\n\nFor the present, if not forever, Juarez may be left out of all American calculations concerning Mexico; and as to Miramon, though his prospects are apparently fair, the intelligent observer of Mexican politics cannot fail to have seen that the glare of the clerical eye is upon him, and that some faint indications on his part of a determination not to be the Church's vassal have already placed his supremacy in peril, and perhaps have caused conspiracies to be formed against him which shall prove more injurious to his fortunes than the operations of Liberal armies or the Messages of American Presidents. The Mexican Church, full-blooded and wealthy as it is, is the skeleton in the palace of every Mexican chief that spoils his sleep and threatens to destroy his power, as it has destroyed that of every one of his predecessors. The armies and banners of the Americans of the North cannot be half so terrible to Miramon, supposing him to be a reflecting man, as are the vestments of his clerical allies. Even those armies, too, may be called into Mexico by the Church, aud those banners become the standards of a crusading host from among a people which of all that the world has ever seen is the least given to religious intolerance, and to whom the mere thought of an established religion is odious. Nor would there be anything strange in such a solution of the Mexican question, if we are to infer the character of the future from the character of the past and the present. A generation that has seen American democracy become the propagandists of slavery assuredly ought not to be astonished at the spectacle of American Protestantism upholding the State religion of Mexico, and that religion embodying the worst abuses of the system of Rome. It was, perhaps, because he foresaw the possibility of this, that \" the grayeyed man of destiny,\" William Walker himself, was reconciled last year to the ancient Church, and received into her bosom. As a Catholic, and as a convert to that faith from heresy, he might achieve those victories for which he longs, but which singularly avoid him as a man of the sword. It is the old story: Satan, being sick, turns saint for the time: only that it is heart-sickness in this instance; the hope of being able to plunder some weak, but wealthy country having been too long deferred for the patience even of an agent of Fate.\n\nThat our government means to persevere in its designs against Mexico, in spite of the misfortunes of the Liberals, is to be inferred from all that we hear from Washington. The victories of Oajaca, Queretaro, and Colima, won by the Conservatives, have wrought no apparent change in the Presidential mind. So anxious, indeed, is Mr. Buchanan for the triumph of his plan, that he is ready to seek aid from his political opponents. Leading Republicans are to be consulted personally, and they are to be appealed to and asked patriotically to banish all party and \" sectional \" feelings from their minds, while discussing the best mode of helping \"our neighbor\" out of the Slough of Despond, so that she may be enabled to meet the demands we have upon her,- not in money, for that she has not, and we purpose giving her a round sum, but in land, of which she has a vast supply, and all of it susceptible of yielding good returns to servile industry. There is a necessity for this appeal to Opposition Senators, as the Juarez treaty cannot be ratified without the aid of some of their number. The ratification vote must consist of two-thirds of the Senators present and voting; and of the sixty-six men forming the Senate, but thirty-nine are Democrats, and two are \" South Americans.\" The Republicans, who could muster but a dozen votes in the Senate when the present phase of the Slavery contest was begun, have doubled their strength, and have arrived at the honor of being sought by men who but yesterday regarded them as objects of scorn. Nor is it altogether a new thing for the administration to depend upon its enemies; and the practical adoption of the \" one-term \" principle in our Presidential contests, by virtually depriving all administrations of strict party support, has introduced into our politics a new element, the first faint workings of which are beginning to be seen, but which is destined to have grave effects, and not such, in all cases, as are to be desired.\n\nBut it is not from the ambition or the perverseness of the President that Mexico has much to fear. Were it not for other reasons, which proceed from the \"Manifest Destiny\" school, the country would laugh down the administration's Mexican programme, and it could hardly be expected to receive the grave consideration of the Senate. What Mexico has to fear is the rapid increase of the old American opinion, that we were appointed by Destiny to devour her, and that in spoiling her we are only fulfilling \" our mission,\" discharging, as we may say, a high moral and religious duty. It is not that we have any animosity toward Mexico, but that we are the Heaven-appointed rulers of America, of which she happens to be no small part. By a happy ordination, and a wise direction of our skill as missionaries militant, we never waste our time and our valor on strong countries; and as wolves do not seek to make meals of lions, preferring mutton, so we have no taste for those very American countries which are inhabited by the English race, and in which exist those great political institutions of the enjoyment, of which we. are so proud. The obligation to take Mexico is admitted by most Americans, though some would proceed more rapidly in the work of acquisition than others ; but no one hints that we ought to have Canada. Our government has repeatedly offered to purchase Cuba of Spain, which offer that country holds to be an insult; but it has not yet thought proper to seek possession of Jamaica. Destiny, in our case, is as judicious as it is imperative, and means that we shall find our account in doing her work. Had she favored some other nations as much as we are favored, they might have flourished till now, instead of becoming wrecks on the sandy shores of the Sea of Time.\n\nThe conviction that Mexico is to be ours is no new idea. It is as old, almost, as the American nation. We found Spain in our path very soon after she had behaved in so friendly a manner to us during the Revolution ; and one of the earliest thoughts of the West was to get her out of the way. This was \"inevitable,\" and \"Manifest Destiny\" was as actively at work in the days of Rodgers Clarke as in those of Walker, but with better reason ; for the control that Spain exercised over the navigation of the Mississippi was contrary to common sense. In a few years, the acquisition of Louisiana (nominally from France, but really from Spain) removed the evil of which the West complained ; but the idea of seizure remained, and was strengthened by the deed that was meant to extinguish it. That Louisiana had been obtained without the loss of a life, and for a sum of money that could be made to sound big only when reduced to francs, was quite enough to cause the continuance of that system of agitation which had produced results so great with means so small. Enmity to Spain remained, after the immediate cause of it had ceased to exist. War with that country was expected in 1806, and the West anxiously desired it, meaning to invade Mexico. Hence the popularity of Aaron Burr in that part of the Union, and the favor with which his schemes were regarded by Western men. Burr was a generation in advance of his Atlantic contemporaries, but he was not in advance of the Ultramontanes, only abreast of them, and well adapted to be their leader, from his military skill and his high political rank ; for his duel with Hamilton had not injured him in their estimation. His connection with the war party, however, proved fatal to it, and probably was the cause of the non-realization of its plans fifty years ago. President Jefferson hated Colonel Burr with all the intensity that philosophy can give to political rivalry ; and so the whole force of the national government was brought to bear against the arch-plotter, who fell with a great ruin, and for the time Mexico was saved. Then came Napoleon's attack on Spain, which necessarily postponed all attempts on countries that might become subject to him; and before the Peninsular War had been decided, we were ourselves involved in war with England, which gave us work enough at home, without troubling \"our neighbor.\" But the events of that war helped to increase the spirit of acquisition in the South and the Southwest, while they put an end forever to plans for the conquest of Canada. The \"aid and comfort\" which the Spaniards afforded to both Indians and Britons, from Florida, led to the seizure of Florida by our forces in time of peace with Spain, and to the purchase of that country. The same year that saw our title to Florida perfected saw the end of Spanish rule in Mexico. The first effect of this change was unfavorable to the extension of American dominion. Mexico became a republic, taking the United States for a model. Principle and vanity alike dictated forbearance on our side, and for some years the new republic was looked upon with warm regard by the American people; and had her experiment proved successful, our territory never could have been increased at her expense. But that experiment proved a total failure. Not even France herself could have done worse for republicanism than was done by Mexico. Internal wars, constant political changes, violations of faith, and utter disregard of the terms of the Constitution,- these things brought Mexico into contempt, and revived the idea that North America had been especially created for the use of the Anglo-Saxon race and the abuse of negroes. As a nation, too, Mexico had been guilty of many acts of violence toward the United States, which furnished themes for those politicians who were interested in bringing on a war between the two countries. The attempt to enforce Centralism on Texas, which contained many Americans, increased the ill-will toward Mexico. The end came in 1846, when we made war on that country, a war resulting in the acquisition of much Mexican territory,- Texas, Upper California, and New Mexico. It cannot be said we behaved illiberally in our treatment of Mexico, the position of the parties considered ; for we might have taken twice as much of her land as we did take, and not have paid her a farthing : and we paid her $l5,000,000, besides assuming the claims which Americans held against her, amounting to $3,250,000 more. The war \" blooded \" the American people, and made the idea of acquiring Mexico a national one ; whereas before it had a sectional character. The question of absorbing that country was held to be merely one of time ; and had it not been for the existence of slavery, much more of Mexico would have been acquired ere now, either by purchase or by war. There have been few men at the head of Mexican affairs, since the peace of 1848, who were not ready to sell us any portion of their country to which we might have laid claim, if we had tendered them the choice between our purse and our sword. We paid SI0,000,000 for the Mesilla Valley, and for certain navigation privileges in the Colorado river and the Gulf of California,- a circumstance that shows how resolute is our determination to have Mexico, and also that we are not disposed to have the process of acquisition marked by shabby details.\n\nThe law that governs the course of conquest is of a plain and obvious character. Occasionally there may arise some conqueror, like Timour, who shall sweep over countries apparently for no other purpose but to play the part of the destroying angel, though it is not difficult to see that even such a man has his uses in the orderings of Providence for the government of the world. But the rule is, that conquest shall, quite as much as commerce, be a gainful business. Conquerors who proceed systematically go from bad lands to good lands, and from good lands to better ones. To get out of the desert into a land flowing with milk and honey is as much the object of modern and uncalled Gentiles as ever it was with ancient called and chosen Jews. Historians appear inclined to censure Darius, because, instead of invading Ilellas, equally weak and fertile, he sought to conquer the poor Scythians, who conquered him. The Romans organized robbery, and had a wonderful skill in selecting peoples for enemies who were worth robbing. \" The Brood of Winter,\" who overthrew the Roman Empire, poured down upon lands where grew the grape and the rose. The Saracens, who were carried forward, in the first instance, by fanaticism, had the streams of their conquests lengthened and broadened and deepened by the wealth and weakness of Greeks and Persians and Goths and Africans. Had those streams poured into deserts, by the deserts they would soon have been absorbed, and we should have known the Mahoinetan superstition only as we know twenty others of those forms of faith produced by the East, - as something sudden, strange, and short-lived. But it was fed by the riches which its votaries gained, the reward of their piety, and the cement of their religious edifice. The Normans, that most chivalrous of races, and, like all chivalrous races, endowed with a keen love of gain, did not seize upon poor countries, but upon the best lands they could take and hold,- the beautiful Neustria, the opulent Sicily, and the fertile England, so admirably situated to become the seat of empire. So, it will be found, have all conquering, absorbing races proceeded, not even excluding the Pilgrim Fathers, who, if they paid the Indians for their lands, generally contrived to get good measure for small disbursements, and to order things so that the lands purchased should be fat and fair in saintly eyes.\n\nTried by the standard of conquest, the course of the American people toward Mexico is the most natural in the world. Mexico possesses immense wealth, and incalculable capabilities in the way of increasing that wealth ; and she is no more competent to defend herself against a powerful neighbor than Sicily was to maintain her independence against the Romans. We are her neighbor, with a population abounding in adventurers domestic and imported, and with politicians who carve out states that shall make them senators and representatives and governors, and perhaps even presidents. As we get nearer to Mexico, the population is more lawless, less inclined to observe those rules upon faith in which the weak must depend for existence. The eagles are gathered about the carcase, and think that to forbid its division among them would be to perpetrate a great moral wrong. The climate of Mexico seems to invite the Northern adventurer to that country. \" In general,\" says Mr. Butterfield, (who has just published a volume that might be called \" The American Conqueror's Guide-Book in Mexico,\" and to which we take this occasion to express our obligations,)-\"in general, the Republic, with the exception of the coast and a few other places, which from situation are extremely hot, enjoys an even and temperate climate, free from the extremes of heat and cold, in consequence of which the most of the hills in the cold regions are covered with trees, which never lose their foliage, and often remind the traveller of the beautiful scenery of the valleys of Switzerland. In Tierra Caliente we are struck by the groves of mimosas, liquid amber, palms, and other gigantic plants characteristic of tropical vegetation; and finally, in Tierra Templada, by the enormous haciendas, many of which are of such extent as to be lost to the sight in the horizon with which they blend.\" This picture is calculated to incite the armed apostles of American liberty, and to render them impatient until they shall have carried the blessings of civilization to Mexico, rewarding themselves for their active benevolence by the appropriation of lands so admirably adapted to the labors of the descendants of Ham, whom it would be impious in them to leave unprovided with the best fields to work out their mission,- which is, to produce the greatest possible crops with the least possible expenditure of capital and care, for the good of that superior race which kindly supplies the deficiencies of Heaven with respect to Africa,- a second Providence, as it were, and slightly tinged with selfishness.\n\nWe need not dwell upon the importance of second causes in the government of mankind. We find them at work in fixing the future of Mexico. The final cause of the absorption of Mexico by the United States will be the restless appropriating spirit of our people; but this might leave her a generation more of national life, were it not that her territory presents a splendid field for slavelabor, and that, both from pecuniary and from political motives, our slaveholders are seeking the increase of the number of Servile States. Mexico is capable of producing an unlimited amount of sugar and an enormous amount of cotton. There is a demand for both these articles,- a demand that is constantly increasing, and which is so great, and grows so rapidly, that the melancholy prospect of rum without sugar has presented itself to some minds, not to speak of only half-allowance to all the tea-tables of Christendom. Africa is beginning to wear shirts, and the stamp of more than one Yankee manufacturer has been indorsed on the backs of many African chiefs. Slavelabor, we are assured, can alone afford au adequate supply of cotton and sugar; for none but negroes can labor on the plantations where cane and cotton are raised, and they will labor only under compulsion, and compulsion can be had only under the system of slavery. The point seems to be as clearly established as reason can establish it, though the negroes might object to the process adopted and to the conclusion drawn; but they are interested parties, and not to be regarded therefore. We must add, that the quality of Mexican sugar is as good as the yield is enormous, and, were the cane-fields in our hands, it would be impious to doubt of there being a fall of a mill on the pound all the world over. Compared with such a gain to the consuming classes, what would it matter that the producers were \" expended \" every four or five years, thereby furnishing an argument in favor of the revival (we should say extension, for it appears to be lively enough) of the slave-trade between Africa and America ? So is it with Mexican cotton, which propagates itself, and is not raised annually from the seed, as in our cotton-growing States. In the Hot Land of Mexico, the laborers in the cottonfields merely keep these fields clear from weeds, as we should say,- no easy task, it may be assumed, with a soil so luxuriant, and where frost is unknown. Yet the amount of cotton produced annually in the Hot Land is shamefully small, not exceeding ten million pounds,- a mere bagatelle, which Manchester would devour in a week. Consider what an increase in cottons and calicoes, what a gain in shirts and sheets, would follow from the seizure of those fields by Americans from Mississippi and Alabama; and let no idle notions concerning national morality prevent the increase of those comforts which the poor now know, but which never came to the knowledge of Cæsar Augustus, and which were unknown to Solomon in all his glory. Where would have been the great English nation, if the adventurous cut-throats who followed Norman William from Saint Valery to Hastings had been troubled with squeamish notions about the rights of the Saxons ?\n\nThere are other articles, besides cotton and sugar, in the production of which slave-labor pays, and pays well, too; and all these articles Mexico is capable of yielding immensely. The world needs more rice ; rice can be cultivated only by negroes, or people much like them ; and rice can be raised in Mexico in incredible quantities, under a judicious system of industry, such as, we are constantly assured, slavery ever has been and ever will be. Tobacco is another Mexican article, and also one in producing which negroes can be profitably employed ; and as tobacco is becoming scarce, while consumers of it are on the increase, it would seem to be our duty to prepare the fields of Tabasco for more extended cultivation, - since there, as well as in many other parts of Mexico, tobacco almost as good as the best that is grown in Cuba can be produced. Coffee, indigo, and hemp are Mexican articles, and can all be cultivated by slave-labor. Maize is grown in every part of the country, yielding three hundred fold in the Hot Land, and twice that rate in one distract; and maize is a slave-grown article. Smaller articles there are, but valuable, in raising which slaves would be found useful, - among them cocoa, vanilla, and frijoles , the last being to the Mexicans what the potato is to the Irish, the common food of the common people. On the supposition that slaves could be made to labor well in wheat-fields,- and under a stringent system of slavery this would be far from impossible, - Mexico might afford profitable employment to myriads of Africans in the course of civilization and Christianization. Wheat returns sixty for one in the best valleys of the Temperate Region ; and when we call to mind that flour is becoming a luxury to poor white people even in America, the propriety of having those valleys filled up with a black population of great industrial capability stands admitted ; and as black people have an unaccountable aversion to working for others, the necessity of slavery is established by the high price of flour, and the capacity of the white races for consuming twice as much as is now produced in the whole world.\n\nIt would be no difficult matter to show that Mexico is the most productive of countries, whether we consider the variety of the articles there grown, or the capabilities of the land for increasing their quantity. To the manufacturer and the merchant she is as attractive as she is to the agriculturist; and her mineral wealth is apparently inexhaustible, and has passed into a proverb. During the thirteen generations since the Spanish Conquest, the value of the gold and silver exported is estimated at $4,640,204,889 ; and this is considered a very low estimate by those best qualified to judge of its correctness. Mr. Butterfield expresses the opinion that the annual export is now near $40,000,000, much of which is smuggled out of the country. The land is also rich in the common metals, the production of which, as well as of gold and silver, would be incalculably increased, should Mexico pass under the dominion of an energetic race, greedy of other men's wealth, if not profuse of its own.\n\nWe have said enough to show the capabilities of Mexico as a slaveholding country; and of the desire of American slaveholders to push their industrial system into countries adapted to it, there are, unfortunately, but too many proofs. They are prompted by the love of power and the love of wealth to obtain possession of Mexico, and the energy that is ever displayed by them when pursuing a favorite object will not allow us to doubt what the end of the contest upon which the United States are about to enter must be. We have, then, to consider the character of the people upon whom slavery is to be forced, and the probable effect of their subjugation to American dominion. The subject is far from being agreeable, and the consideration of it gives rise to the most painful thoughts that can move the mind.\n\nThe exact number of people in Mexico it is not possible to state. Mr. Mayer estimated that in 1850 the proximate actual population was 7,626,831, classed as follows:-Whites, 1,100,000; Indians, 4,354,886; Mestizos, Zambos, Mulattoes, etc., 2,165,345; Negroes, 6,600. Only one-seventh of the population belongs to that class, or caste, to which, according to the common sentiment in the United States, dominion over the earth has been given. The other six-sevenths are, in American estimation, and would so become in fact, should Mexico own our rule, mere political Pariahs ; and if they should escape personal slavery, it would be through their rapid extinction under the blasting effects of civilization. There are, at this time, it may be assumed, 7,000,000 human beings in Mexico to whom few Americans are capable of conceding the full rights of humanity. Of these, about one-third, the negroes and the mixed races, from the fact that they have African blood in their veins, would be outlawed by the mere conquest of Mexico by American arms, so far as relates to the higher conditions of life. As several of our States have already compelled free negroes to choose between slavery and banishment, and as the American settlers of Mexico would proceed principally from States in which the sentiment prevails that has led to the adoption of so illiberal a policy, a third of the native population would, it is likely, be reduced to a condition of chattel slavery within a very short time after the change of government had been effected. There is not an argument used in behalf of the rigid slave codes of several of our States which would not be applicable to the enslavement of the black and mixed Mexicans, all of whom would be of darker skins and less enlightened minds than the slaves that would be taken to the conquered land by the conquerors. How could the slaves thus taken there be allowed to see even their inferiors in the enjoyment of personal freedom? If the State of Arkansas can condescend to be afraid of a few hundred free negroes and mulattoes, and can illustrate its fear by turning them out of their homes in midwinter, what might not be expected from a ruling caste in a new country, with two and a half millions of colored people to strike terror into the souls of those comprising it ? Just or humane legislation could not be looked for at the hands of such men, who would be guilty of that cruelty which is born of injustice and terror. The white race of Mexico would join with the intrusive race to oppress the mixed races; and as the latter would be compelled to submit to the iron pressure that would be brought to bear upon them, more than two millions of slaves would be added to the servile population of America, and would become the basis of a score of Representatives in the national legislature, and of as many Presidential Electors ; so that the practice of the grossest tyranny would give to the Slaveholding States, per saltum, as great an increase of political power as the Free States could expect to achieve through a long term of years illustrated by care and toil and the most liberal expenditure of capital.\n\nThe Indians would fare no better than the mixed races, though the mode of their degradation might differ from that which would be pursued toward the latter. The Indians of Mexico are a race quite different from the Indians whom we have exterminated or driven to the remote West. They are a sad, a superstitious, and an inert people, upon whom Spanish tyranny has done its perfect work. Nominally Christians, they are nearly as much devoted to paganism as were their ancestors of the age of the Conquistadores. They are the most finished conservatives on the face of the earth, and see ruin in change quite as readily as if they lived in New England and their opinions were worth quoting on State Street. The traveller can see in Mexican fields, to-day, the manner in which those fields were cultivated in the early days of the last Montezuma, before the Spaniard had entered the land,- as in Canada he can occasionally find men following the customs that were brought, more than two centuries ago, from Brittany or Normandy. The Indians are practically enslaved by two things: they are so attached to the soil on which they are born as to regard expulsion from it as the greatest of all punishments,- thus being much like those serfs who, in some other countries, are legally bound to the land, and are sold with it; and they are forever in debt, the consequence of reckless indulgence, and of that inability to think of the morrow which is the most prominent characteristic of the inferior races of men. This has caused the existence of the system of peonage , of which so much has been said in this country, in the attempts that have been made to show that slavery already prevails in Mexico. But American planters never would he content with peonage, which docs not give to the employer any power over the Indians' offspring, or convey to him any of those rights of property in his fellow-men which form the most attractive feature of slavery as it exists in the United States. They would demand something more than that; and the system of repartimientos, under which the Indians of the time of Cortés were divided among the conquerors, with the land, would not improbably follow the annexation of Mexico to the United States. The natives would be compelled to labor far more vigorously than they now labor, and their burdens would be increased in the same ratio in which the American is more energetic and exacting than the Mexican. Under such a system, the Indians would vanish as rapidly as they did from Hayti, when a similar system was adopted there, soon after the discovery of America. Then would arise a demand for the revival of the slave-trade with Africa, and on the same ground on which African slavery was introduced into America,-because the negro is better able than the Indian to meet the demands which the white man makes upon the weaker races who happen to be placed in his power. With such unlimited fields for the production of sugar and cotton, those leading agencies of Christianity and civilization, it would never do for the world to deny to the new school of planters a million of negroes, so necessary to the full development of the purpose of the American crusaders. Observe what a gain it would be to the shipping interest, could the seas become halcyonized through the conquest of prejudices by men who believe that God is just, and that He has made of one flesh and one blood all the nations of the earth !\n\nEven if it should not be sought to enslave the Indians of Mexico, that race would not be the less doomed. There seems to be no chance for Indians in any country into which the Anglo-Saxon enters in force. A system of free labor would be as fatal to the Mexican Indians as a system of slave labor. The whites who would throng to Mexico, on its conquest by Americans, and on the supposition that slavery should not be established there, would regard the Indians with sentiments of strong aversion. They would hate them, not only because they were Indians, - which would be deemed reason enough,- but as competitors in industry, who could afford to work for low wages, their wants being few, and the cost of their maintenance small. It is charged against the Indians that they are not flesheaters ; and white men prefer meat to any other description of food. Place a flesheating race in antagonism with a race that lives on vegetables, and the former will eat up the latter. The sentiment of the whites toward the Indians is not unlike that which has been expressed by an eminent American statesman, who says that the cause of the failure of Mexico to establish for herself a national position is to be sought and found in her acknowledgment of the political equality of her Indian population. He would have them degraded, if not absolutely enslaved; and degradation, situated as they are, implies their extinction. This is the opinion of one of the ablest men in the Democratic party, who, though a son of Massachusetts, is ready to go as far in behalf of slavery as any son of South Carolina.\n\nAnother eminent Democrat, no less a man, indeed, than President Buchanan, is committed to very different views. He is the patron of Juarez, whom he would support with all the power of the United States, and whose government he would carry to \"the halls of the Montezumas\" in the train of an American army. Now Juarez is a pure-blooded and full-blooded Indian. Not a drop of Castilian blood, blue or black, flows in his veins. He is a genuine Toltec, a member of that mysterious race which flourished in the Valley of Mexico ages before the arrival of the Aztecs, and the marvellous remains of whose works astonish the traveller in Yucatan and Guatemala. He is a native of Oajaca, one of the Pacific States, and the same that contained the vast estates bestowed upon Cortés, to whom the Valley of Oajaca furnished his title of Marquis. A poor Indian boy, and a fruit-seller, Juarez found a patron, who saw his cleverness, and gave him an education, and so enabled him to play no common part in his country, - the independence of which he seems prepared to destroy, in the hope, perhaps, of securing for it a stable and well-ordered government."

      "text": "The Textbook That Calls Mexicans Lazy\n\nActivists and teachers worked for years to get Mexican American Studies into Texas schools, but they don't want the book the board of education is set to endorse.\n\nUpdated on September 9 at 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nFor years teachers and activists in Texas had tried to get Mexican American studies on the curriculum. More than half of the state's school system is Latino, and Mexicans make up the majority of that number, so some Texans wanted the state to offer an optional course that taught history through a different lens.\n\nTwo years ago, the Texas State Board of Education called for publishers to submit a Mexican American Studies textbook for a special-topics social-studies course, which would make the class available to schools that wished to teach it. In May the Texas Education Agency released a sample of the course textbook it's considering, and it has prompted anger and derision.\n\nThe latest development in this Mexican American Studies (MAS) struggle came Tuesday. A group of historians and educators released a 54-page report that outlines what they say are factual errors and important omissions in the textbook. But most of all, the informal committee says, the textbook is thematically flawed: It talks of Mexicans as lazy, and Mexican Americans as cultural separatists, stubbornly resisting assimilation.\n\n\"This may seem like this is about books,\" Tony Diaz, an author, professor, radio host, and Houston activist, told me. But it's not.\n\nNew Mexico has been majority Latino for some time. California just became so last year. In Arizona and Texas, the K-12 systems recently changed to majority Latino, meaning the states are on their way. Beyond their legal language, both SB 1070 and HB 2281 had the impact of subverting Latinos and their culture-one by allowing police to racially profile residents, and the other by washing schools of any Chicano cultural emphasis. Diaz gave me another example of this, one that did not make national news. He calls it the Piñata war of 2012 .\n\nHarris County, Texas, had outlawed piñatas at its public parks. They posted big blue signs that said so. The county argued piñatas were messy. But to Diaz, to the activists, and to families, it was as if the county had banned birthdays at the parks specifically for Mexican children. Unlike Arizona's more blatant approach to banning Latino culture, Diaz said, \"Texas is so subtle we have to argue if it's discrimination or not.\"\n\nAmong Diaz's many titles is libro-traficante . That title also came from Arizona's law against MAS, which included a ban on seven Mexican American books used in the class. Diaz and other activists bought those books and took donations and smuggled the outlawed texts into Tucson, so he anointed himself a book smuggler. This is how the Texas fight for MAS began. When Diaz returned to Houston, he realized his school district didn't even have a MAS course the state could ban if it wanted. Diaz and other activists, including Ruben Cortez Jr., an education board member, fought to put MAS in the Texas school system. It took four years, but when the board voted to allow MAS as a special topic in social studies, it felt like a victory. Then they saw the book.\n\nThe Mexican American Heritage textbook, published by Momentum Instruction, a little-known company, pictures an Aztec dancer on the cover wearing a garishly feathered headdress. Critics of the book point out the Aztec dancer, while indicative of 14 th century Mexico, has nothing to do with Mexican Americans. Inside the book, the informal review committee's report found 68 factual errors, 42 interpretive errors, and 31 omission errors. So far, only one error has been corrected . That was a passage insinuating the official language of the U.S. is English. There is, in fact, no official U.S. language. But outside of factual errors, the report's authors point out the many, many thematic issues with the book.\n\nOne passage titled \"Ethnic Hostility\" describes how in the late 1800s, when foreigners came to \"develop\" Mexico, the country's citizens grew angry. This was, the book explains, because industrialists often brought their own workers, cutting out local Mexicans. The foreign companies did this because Mexicans couldn't understand how to work jobs that required \"more technological know-how\" like in the mining and oil industry. But it was also because \"stereotypically, Mexicans were viewed as lazy compared to European or American workers.\" The passage, as you can see above in the picture, doesn't provide much context. But it seems to be referencing the age of Porfirio Diaz, the Mexican president and dictator who ruled for 30 years and who kicked villagers off their land to rent out to foreign interests. This led to calls for agrarian land reform and, eventually, the 1910 Mexican Revolution. At the end of the passage, it again references the lackadaisical Mexican work ethic by referencing a \"mañana\" attitude toward chores, and to drinking on the job.\n\nThe word Chicano-though it gained in popularity in the 1960s and alongside Cesar Chavez's labor movement-is apolitical. It's not a widely used term, or a preferred one, but it has always meant someone with Mexican roots. The Mexican American Heritage book, however, says Chicanos are people who \"adopted a revolutionary narrative that opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society.\"\n\nThe book also addresses the issue of illegal immigration, attributing to it an increase in \"poverty, drugs, crime, non-assimilation, and exploitation.\" And for a book about Mexican American history, it has a surprisingly sparse amount of it, as the Texas Observer pointed out :\n\nIn a 500-page book, only the last few chapters confront civil and labor rights issues. Most is subject matter you'd expect in any U.S. history book - the Declaration of Independence, the Kennedy assassination, the Cold War.\n\nThere are many other issues activists have taken- 141 precisely -but for a book that will instruct students about Mexican American history and culture, it took a peculiarly Alt-right view of them. This made more sense after teachers and activists learned who published the book.\n\nMomentum Instruction doesn't have much information about itself online. Its website was created last November , and there's no indication of how many textbooks it's published, or if this is the only one. But its owner, as the Houston Chronicle pointed out , is well known to Texans. Cynthia Dunbar served from 2007 to 2011 on the Texas State Board of Education and gained more fame than the position typically endows after she published a book called One Nation Under God , in which she called the U.S. education system \"tyrannical\" and said sending kids to public school is like \" throwing them into the enemy's flames .\" (Her book was published while she served on the board of education.) She's now a professor at Liberty University, founded by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell.\n\nI spoke with Dunbar and she was upset about the coverage her textbook had received. It was never her intent, she told me, to write a book that offended people. \"Why would you choose to write a Mexican American studies textbook when your only goal is to the malign the culture you're writing about?\" she asked rhetorically.\n\nI asked her why it was necessary to include passages that called Mexicans lazy, even if those were prefaced by saying it was a stereotype. She said it was a perception of the time, one that Mexicans worked to overcome, and that she wasn't interested in whitewashing history, only with presenting \"the good, the bad, and the ugly\" of it all. Another issue that bothered critics was there seemed to be no Mexican Americans included in writing a book about their history-something that might have helped with the tonal issues in the book, if indeed they were harmless oversights. Dunbar said the deadline didn't allow her to find a Mexican American professor willing to work within the time constraints. If teachers don't like it, Dunbar said, and the board still votes to endorse the book, \"that doesn't  keep them from using any of these other textbooks.\"\n\nShe's right. As of now, the textbook is not a certainty. The board of education will vote whether to adopt the book in November. If it does endorse the book, Texas schools that want to teach MAS won't be required to use it. There are some schools that teach MAS in Texas, like Mission High School, where Trinidad Gonzales created the first dual-enrollment class in the state. Gonzales' course draws on a few different books, but swapping out texts isn't the point, he told me. It'd be one thing if it were just a bad book, Gonzales said, \"but this is a bad textbook that is also racist.\"\n\nIt may seem like a lot of hell to raise over a textbook that's optional, but it's not really about a textbook. Laws like Arizona's SB 1070, HB 2281, this textbook, even Diaz's Piñata war of 2012, are really about the shifting cultural dynamics of the region. Soon all the Southwest will be majority Latino. Not everyone likes that idea."

      "text": "The Human Side of Mexico\n\nAN old Mexican was speaking, a gray-haired laborer who had worked for twelve years in California. He was on his way to a village in Sonora.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'I am going home; I have been here long enough. It is true that wages are better, but money is not everything: to be content a man needs some esteem. Here I can never be more than a Mexican who must be watched to see that he does an honest day's work. I do not believe that I am lazy,- I have done my best for my employers, - but it is hard for us to please the Americans.\n\n'One of my friends tells of a Mexican who was traveling through Arizona with his grandson. They had a donkey which the old man rode while the boy walked behind. After a time they passed some Americans on the road. \"Look at that man,\" said one, \"riding his burro while the little boy walks - just like a lazy Mexican! \" The old man understood a little English, so he dismounted and made the boy ride. Presently a party of cowboys cantered by. \"Mexicans are a shameless people,\" they said; \"see how that lazy boy rides, while the old man walks behind in the dust.\" Hearing this, the Mexican mounted behind his grandson, and the donkey went on, carrying double. At the foot of a hill they met a stage. \"Lazy Mexicans,\" exclaimed the passengers scornfully, \"both riding that poor little burro!\"\n\nThere is a germ of truth in this view of our attitude toward the Mexicans. We are inclined to believe that difference from ourselves implies inferiority - an insular weakness which has been the chief obstacle to cordial relations with the Latin-American republics. Whatever the outcome of the present situation, a little tolerance will do no harm - a little effort to see the good in a race we do not at present understand.\n\nThe Mexican may be described as an Indian with a dash of Iberian blood. No statistics are available, but it is doubtful whether the proportion of Spanish blood exceeds one eighth possibly it is less. Except in the case of a few tribes like the Yaquis of Sonora and t he Mayas of Yucatan, Mexico has absorbed, or is rapidly absorbing, all her aborigines; unlike ourselves, she has been confronted with no Indian problem. The native blood predominating in the mixture is that of the ancient Nahua race, which included all the ruling tribes from the Rio Grande to Tehuantepec - a group of which the Aztecs were the most famous and powerful members. In an admirable characterization of the Aztec, Mr. Lewis Spence describes him as 'grave, taciturn, and melancholic, with a deeply rooted love of the mysterious; slow to anger, yet almost inhuman in the violence of his passions when aroused. He is usually gifted with a logical mind, quickness of apprehension and an ability to regard the subtle side of things with great nicety. . . - He has a real affection for the beautiful in nature and a passion for flowers; but the Aztec music lacked gayety, and the national amusements were too often of a gloomy and ferocious character.' My own experience among the remnants of the race leads only to increased respect for Mr. Spence's insight, although he has failed to give credit for a fine domesticity and love of children.\n\nThe philosophy of the modern Mexican is as foreign to us as the customs of ancient Mexico. The chief incentive which drives the European races on to struggle and progress is the desire for material gain, but in the life of the Mexican this motive plays only a secondary part. Some years ago I was visiting a cane plantation in the state of Vera Cruz. It was time to cut the sugar-cane, and as usual there was a shortage of labor. Ordinary wages were the equivalent of forty cents a day. The manager made calculations and found that he could double the rate for cane-cutting and still be ahead, because the running-time of his mill would be cut in half. At least, he believed, in his ignorance of the people, that it could be cut in half. So announcement of double pay was made, and long lines of peons came trudging in - but they worked only half time!\n\nAn old woman in the market-place of Córdoba gave me further enlightenment. I used to buy fruit of her, and one morning I found that she had nothing to sell except a basket of particularly fine mangoes - Manila mangoes, not the ordinary resinous kind. I inquired the price: to a friend they were worth a penny each.\n\n'How many are there, Doña Ignacia?' I asked.\n\nShe counted them laboriously, twice over; there were thirty. I took thirty cents from my pocket, handed her the money and reached for the basket.\n\n'But no, señor,' she protested; 'if you take them all I must charge forty cents.'\n\n'Why so?' I asked, not a little puzzled at her logic; 'you can get no more if you sell them one by one, and by selling them all to me you will have the rest of the day to yourself.'\n\nShe shook her head in vehement denial. 'No, no,' she explained; 'you do not understand. Take half a dozen if you like at a penny each, but I cannot let you have all at that price. If I sell them all at once, I lose the pleasure of a day's market.'\n\nThis attitude of mind is difficult for us to comprehend. Mexico is a wonderfully fertile land, where crops seem to grow almost without attention; Humboldt declared it the richest in the world. Long ago the country Mexican discovered that he could live with a minimum of effort. There is food in the house, the sun is warm overhead, there are amusing neighbors with whom to gossip - why overdo the business of work? It is a pleasant philosophy, fit for a pleasant land.\n\nIf you share the American idea that the Mexican is lazy, go to the cities and watch the Mexican craftsmen working at the arts in which they excel. See how the leather-worker leans over his bench all day, carving out flowers and scrolls with exquisite skill. Ask him the price of an embossed pistol-holster, and the chances are that he will scratch his head distractedly before he can recall the amount -it is not fair to interrupt one's work for a little thing like money.\n\nOn several occasions I have employed Mexicans side by side with Americans at the same work, against the advice of friends, who predicted racial feeling and the demoralization of the regular men. The Americans were fine fellows, such as exist by millions in our country, and the Mexicans relatively the same. What was the result? Miguel became Mike; Pedro, Pete; Juan, Johnny. They held up their end manfully, so that more than one of my countrymen came to tell me privately that he had changed his opinion of Mexicans. They grew to understand the good-nature of our rougher ways, and worked well because it seemed the thing to do, where a man was measured by what he could accomplish. I even fancied at times that the Mexicans were not the only ones to profit by the mixture of races. No good American would confess that he had learned manners from a foreigner, but one felt vaguely an atmosphere of quieter courtesy and greater consideration.\n\nBoth the Spanish and the Indians with whom they have intermarried are people of inherent good manners and of thoughtfulness for the feelings of others. Traveling in Mexico one drifts into conversation with a chance acquaintance and asks him where he lives. 'In Guadalajara,' he replies, 'on the street of Zaragoza; there you have your home.' Perhaps one is walking with a Mexican and passes his place. 'Is that your house?' one asks; and he answers, 'No, it is yours.'\n\nThese are set forms, of course, mechanically spoken and not meant to be taken literally; but I should hesitate to say that they are entirely without a basis of sincerity. We are too apt to sneer at such amenities, not realizing that to the Mexican there is no duty more sacred than that of hospitality. The poorest peon, with only a handful of corn in his grass hut, will share it with a belated traveler who asks for shelter, and will sleep on the floor while the stranger enjoys the comfort of a bed. In such cases money is neither offered nor expected; if it is desired to tender a small gift in return for some unusual service, one is often obliged to invent diplomatic means of disguising the idea of compensation.\n\nA few years ago, in southern Mexico, I set out on a forty-mile ride to get money for the plantation pay-roll. The east was brightening as I passed the quarters; lights were appearing in one hut after another as the women began to work at their charcoal braziers and I heard the patting of tortillas and a sleepy hum of talk. Drowsy chickens were waking, to flutter down from the trees. Beyond the pasture the trail led straight into the blank wall of the jungle, above which the morning mist was rising in slow wreaths.\n\nHour after hour I penetrated deeper into this tropical forest - the trail, a tunnel, with soft decaying vegetation underfoot, and a dim roof of green. The enormous trunks of trees, shrouded in creepers and pale orchids, stood like columns seen by twilight, in some ruined temple. My horse's feet made no sound. Strange little animals - sloths, anteaters, and coatis - walked slowly and noiselessly along the branches; small gray birds flitted silently from tree to tree, always just ahead. There was a sense of veiled watching, oppressive and unreal as the atmosphere of a dream - one felt that it would be dangerous to whistle, even to speak above a whisper.\n\nAt last, as I reached the edge of a forgotten clearing, I realized that something more than imagination was at fault, for my head was throbbing painfully and I felt the cold touch of a malarial chill.\n\nI got off my horse and spent a bad thirty minutes beside the trail, shivering and half delirious, until an old woman came hobbling up in great concern. There were no men at her hut, but she would lead the horse if I could walk - Come, it was only five minutes away.\n\nMy chill developed into a brisk attack of pernicious fever; for two weeks I lay on a mat under kind old María's grass-thatched roof. There was no quinine, but she took delight in compounding certain doubtful brews which I was too weak to refuse. She was poor: there was not even a dog about the place, for dogs must eat. Her one possession was a pig, the very apple of her eye, christened Narciso after a departed son. Had he looked in a pool. Narciso would scarcely have fallen in love with his own image, but in the eyes of his mistress he was perfect. His mate, she informed me, had been killed by a jaguar.\n\nAs I grew stronger, I began to think of my departure. Knowing that she would take no pay for what was a common duty, I cast about for a way to save her face and yet make fair recompense for all that she had done. The idea came one morning as I lay on my mat, watching Narciso trot pensively from the jungle in answer to Maria's shrill summons.\n\n'I have a favor to ask of you,' I said, when the day of parting came. 'It is evident, to one in sympathy with pigs, that Narciso feels the absence of his companion. It would relieve my mind to know that he was not lonely, so please take these twenty pesos and provide him with a fitting mate.'\n\nIn Latin-America these little courtesies have their part in business - the Mexican will often pay a greater price in order to deal with a man whose manners and personality inspire confidence. Our salesmen complain of the slowness of doing business in Mexico, not realizing that it is because the native likes to have a thorough knowledge of the man with whom he is dealing. The type we call 'a good talker,' or 'a quick closer,' is out of place in the southern republics, where the quiet and wellbred man, who conforms to native customs, mails home the largest orders.\n\nIn the past, we have taken as little pains to understand the character and customs of the Mexicans, as to study their commercial needs. I shall not forget the case of a Mexican neighbor who had been considering the installation of a large plant for the treatment of coffee, and finally placed his order with the representative of an American manufacturer. Of the various bids received, the successful one was by no means the lowest: it was accepted mainly because of the good-breeding and pleasant manners of the young American who had often visited the home of Don Enrique.\n\nThe planter had been careful to explain that no single piece or casting must weigh over three hundred pounds - the old story of mule transport. It was a sad day for him when the machinery was unloaded at the nearest railway point: the packing was wretched, with several cases broken, and a number of parts weighed far in excess of the limit. The planter was almost too patient and good-natured over the affair. Gangs of peons succeeded in carrying everything except the steamengine to the plantation. The engine had a fly-wheel weighing twelve hundred pounds, and even this, by superhuman efforts, they managed to roll fifteen miles over the mountain trails. Finally, at the top of one of the huge misty gorges which scar the flanks of Orizaba, it broke away and went bounding and crashing down two thousand feet, to lie forever in the bed of a mountain stream.\n\nThe Mexican is a lover of formality, both in manners and in dress. Eccentricity is not understood where one is judged largely by external things. Each man dresses according to his station: it is unthinkable that a well-to-do man should wear a straw sombrero or carry a sarape; the peons would be the first to jeer at him.\n\nIn the state of Oaxaca there used to be an Englishman who had married a Mexican lady of the upper class - a charming woman, educated abroad and very popular among the foreign residents. He was an excellent fellow, a hard worker who did not believe in riding to the cane-fields dressed as a boulevardier. It was one of our amusements to hear his wife upbraid him for looking like a cane-cutter; she could never understand his hatred of good clothes in the daytime.\n\nThis couple illustrated another difference in point of view, a small thing, but curiously indicative of the mental gulf which separates us from LatinAmerica. Doña Lola, in common with most of her countrywomen, was a great lover of pets, on which she lavished an almost foolish amount of tenderness and care. Her husband used to curse softly as he unclamped a parrot from the hat-rack, or discovered a tame oscelot asleep in his chair. A genuine horseman and lover of horses, he found it impossible to comprehend her tenderness for pets, coupled with a complete indifference to the feelings of domestic animals. On our rides together I have seen him bite his lip to keep down angry words at sight of the blood dripping from the flanks of his wife's horse.\n\nThe Mexican inherits this cruelty to domestic beasts from both the Spaniard and the Indian, and his superstitions may be traced to the same double source. Few countries are richer in strange beliefs than Mexico, where witches assume the eyes of cats and flit through the night on vampire's wings, where a brisk business is done in love-potions, and where candle-flames still point the way to buried treasure. Religion and superstition are closely linked, as is shown in the fear of the ghosts of unbaptized children, who wail along the fence that bars the way to consecrated ground. To the Mexican, religion is very real; heaven and hell actual places to be avoided or attained according to one's life. His is not an intellectual creed, but a thing of pure faith, which answers the purpose just as well. There is a Celtic tinge in this attitude toward religion and the supernatural - the same faith, the same melancholy, the same half-heathen superstition. Perhaps there are other affinities between the races: certainly no one can fail to remark how well an Irishman gets on in Mexico.\n\nA prospector I used to know was camped on the Gulf coast of Lower California, and one night a ragged white man appeared at the fireside, asking for water. Announcing in a rich brogue that he was a deserter from a whaling vessel, he inquired the way to the nearest village. My friend told him there was a little plaza forty miles inland, and offered to show him the way if he would wait two or three days. The Irishman was impatient, however, and in spite of the other's warning that it was almost certain death to attempt the trip without water, he started off at daybreak. Three days later the prospector rode into Rosarito, mildly sorry for the poor madman who traveled Mexico without a word of Spanish, and was probably dead of thirst, somewhere in the sandhills. The village had a gala air; from the cantina came the scraping of fiddles and the shuffle of dancers' feet. Troops of people were passing in and out of the largest house in town, and as the prospector drew near, who should appear in the doorway but the Irish wanderer, gorgeously arrayed, and leading a dusky but blushing young woman.\n\n'It's welcome you are,'he said proudly, 'and glad I am to see you on me weddin' day. Let me introduce you to me wife.'\n\nIn the human qualities which all civilizations have admired, I do not believe the Mexican will be found wanting. He has plenty of physical courage: given the right leader, he makes a very passable soldier. His moral courage is not yet equal to that of the European races, for men fear the things they do not understand, and only education brings understanding. In commercial dealings I have found the Mexican, with few exceptions, honorable. This applies to the more educated classes; the others are upright in important matters, but inclined to small prevarication and thievery. Your house servant - a faithful fellow, perhaps, who would risk his life for you in an emergency - is apt to make raids on your cigars. If you catch him redhanded, you will be wise to scold him half-laughingly, for the privilege of outwitting you in small ways is one of his compensations for being a servant - almost a servant's prerogative. The Mexican conception of personal honor differs oddly from ours. Strike an American, and he will fight, but you may be friends again; call him a liar or by any opprobrious name, and you have made an enemy. Almost any verbal offense can be patched up with a Mexican, but strike him in a moment of anger, and he will never forget.\n\nThe quality of charity is nowhere more universal than in Mexico. In the peon's hut, when the family sits down to the scanty meal, there is always room for one more at the table - the thought of turning away the needy never enters their minds. Tramps are unknown; there is always a relative or compadre who will help out in time ol trouble. Like charity, love and respect for parents are inherent in the race: the Mexican who has received a mortal wound does not call upon God: he whispers pathetically, 'Mama!'\n\nThere is good in the Mexican people, in spite of nine years of turmoil and excess. In the old days the country was in the hands of a few hereditary aristocrats, many of them thoughtful men, who realized their responsibilities and cared for the people by whose labor they profited. Then came Diaz. He established a few schools, and his political system gave birth to a middle class from which it became possible to step into the class of landlords. Such parvenus, with no conception of the responsibilities their position entailed, spent their time at the capital, leaving the management of their estates to men who were paid in proportion to the income they were able to wring from the unfortunate tenants and laborers. It is an old story, and the result was inevitable; the Mexicans are struggling blindly, but they are struggling to remedy conditions which had become intolerable.\n\nI shall always remember a visit I paid my friend Don Blas, a few weeks before the outbreak of the Madero revolution. His plantation, the Hacienda Tlalocan, lies among the tropical foothills of Orizaba, and was in those days a charming example of the old benevolent paternalism - now gone forever. Six generations of the family had lived like kings among the fullblooded Aztecs, speaking their language, and knowing them as few educated men will again. The house was built of plastered stone, with roofs of tile. Gates of native wrought-iron work gave on the cobbled patio , three hundred feet long and a hundred wide, where a fountain played and girls poured water into jars, lingering to laugh and pass the time of day. Near the gate was the general store and canteen, and along the arched galleries one found representatives of the useful trades: saddler, blacksmith, butcher, baker, and dipper of tallow candles.\n\nIt was Saturday evening. The bookkeeper had moved his desk out into the court, and was paying off. Don Bias and I stood nearby, watching the people file in. The book-keeper spoke Aztec with fascinating ease, reading to each man the total of his earnings for the week as well as the amount of his purchases at the store, and handing him the balance in silver coin. Mutual trust made the transaction perfunctory; the Indians were as little likely to suspect Don Blas as he to take advantage of their confidence. Each worker, before he turned to the canteen for his aguardiente, took off his hat, bowed, and raised Don Blas's hand to his lips. Smile if you will; I assure you there was nothing servile in what was simply the greeting of friends-one small, the other great, but. friends nevertheless. .\n\nWhen the last Indian had been paid, a young woman came and stood before us, awaiting permission to speak. Two men were lounging near the gate, one holding a rope which bound the other's arms; they chatted together pleasantly, the guard helping his prisoner to light a corn-husk cigarette. Don Blas nodded and the woman broke into a flood of swift speech, the words merging sibilantly, musical with lingual sounds. Strange to think that here in the twentieth century one heard the old Nahuatlatolli - the language of Montezuma - scarcely changed in the long years since Cortez first marched inland from the coast! The woman grew more vehement, made motions of tearing off her cotton huipil, and pointed to her back and shoulders. Finally, with a stamp of her foot, she turned accusingly toward the prisoner, who shifted about uneasily and did not meet her eyes. Don Blas spoke soothingly in Aztec.\n\n'This woman,' he said to me with a chuckle, 'is the wife of Juan Elotlan yonder - he has been beating her. You have heard how she talks; one can scarcely blame him, eh? She had the alguazil tie him up and wants me to punish him. What shall I do ?'\n\nI shook my head; I am no Solomon. Don Blas thought for a moment.\n\n'Listen, thou,' he told the guard in Spanish; 'give the woman a strap and let her beat Juan until she is content.'\n\nHalf an hour later I saw the pair shuffling homeward: it was evident that neither bore a grudge.\n\nWe dined that night in the family dining-room. The furniture of native mahogany, hand-carved a century or two before, was beautiful beyond price. Don Blas sat at the head of the table, a clear-eyed man of sixty, straight and slender, bearded like a caliph of the Moors. Felipe, the superintendent, came in after we were seated and slipped into a chair opposite my host. Once or twice during the meal I spoke to him, but got no answer save a courteous yes or no. When he had finished, he rose, stood behind his chair, and bowed. Don Blas glanced up with a careless nod; Felipe bowed again and left the room.\n\nWhen I expressed interest in the oldtime customs of the place, my host shook his head a little sadly.\n\n'In a few years it will be gone,' he said; ' the old life ends with my generation. My son does not care to live here - he prefers the animation of the capital. There he has his horses, his motors, his friends at the Jockey Club. There is money enough; why should he not live the life he enjoys? As for me, I am a countryman, I like to hear the birds sing, to ride through the damp forest at sunrise. But sometimes I fear for my people; the little Indians need one who understands, to look after them. On any street-corner in Mexico one may hear whispers of the change to come. Our future depends on you Americans of the north, and all Latin-America will be watching. Let us hope that in those trying days you will deal with us tolerantly - making an effort to see the good which exists in the Mexican people.'\n\nDon Blas was an educated and a thoughtful man. As I think of his words, a more recent incident comes to mind. It was at the ranch of a border cattleman. We had come in at dusk, leaving our horses in the corral. Walking toward the house, we met the Mexican chore-boy, a pleasant-faced lad, fresh from Sonora. The cattleman stopped him and pointed to the corral.\n\n' You vamos down yonder,' he ordered, 'and drive them caballos over to the creek for a drink. Pronto now!'\n\nThe boy listened respectfully, his intelligent eyes bright with the striving to understand. Finally he shook his head.\n\n'No entiendo, señor,' he said.\n\nThe American looked at mein disgust.\n\n' Can you beat it ? ' he remarked; ' that Mexican don't even understand his own language!'"

      "text": "3 Reasons \"the Great Wave of Migration From Mexico Has Come to an End\"\n\nLatest from Pew Research Center signals the decisive decline of one flow of immigrants.\n\nMark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at Pew Research Center, has officially declared the end to the mass migration of Mexicans to the United States. The bold pronouncement came over an afternoon phone call hours prior to the release of the Pew Research Center's latest analysis of the issue. In it, the stalwart of statistical analysis reports that about 1 million Mexican immigrants returned to their home country between 2009 and 2014 of their own accord.\n\n\"The great wave of migration from Mexico has come to an end. You can see that in data starting in 2007, where we got some hints that it was coming to an end. Mexico just isn't sending the same amount of people to the U.S.,\" Lopez said. Mexico still holds the title of \"largest birth country\" among the foreign-born population in the U.S., at 28 percent. \"Mexican immigrants have been at the center of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history. Between 1965 and 2015, more than 16 million Mexican immigrants migrated to the United States-more than from any other country,\" the study declares.\n\nFirst, there is the slow recovery of our economy following the latest recession, which could have discouraged new potential immigrants from coming and encouraged many here to return home in the face of worsening job prospects and a generally bleak economic outlook. \"Based on the data collected in Mexico, Mexicans' opinions about life in the U.S. are changing. Not all Mexicans think that this is such a great place to emigrate to. Their relationships here seem to be deteriorating,\" Lopez said. As the report notes, \"While almost half (48%) of adults in Mexico believe life is better in the U.S., a growing share, 33%, says it is neither better nor worse than life in Mexico-a share 10 percentage points higher than in 2007.\"\n\nFamily reunification ranks as the top reason for those who willingly returned home, with 61 percent stating that they returned to be with loved ones. \"Oftentimes, it's a father who is coming back to be with his family he left in Mexico. It is an extended family reunification, reuniting with grandparents and other extended family members,\" Lopez explained. \"What's more, the Mexican economy is doing better; there are lots of opportunities in engineering and other fields.\" Lopez concluded that the returning immigrants may also have an economic advantage upon returning. \"Many of the folks returning have skills sets that may have a payoff in Mexico-skills in building a home, starting a business.\"\n\nLastly, stricter enforcement of immigration laws at the border also played a role: Apprehensions of Mexicans trying to enter the U.S. from the southern border fell to 230,000 in fiscal year 2014, \"a level not seen since 1971.\" Tighter enforcement has also led to more deportations of Mexicans, with 14 percent of return migrants in Mexico claiming this as the reason for being back."

      "text": "Just Because Mexicans Can Become U.S. Citizens Doesn't Mean They Will\n\nLegal Mexican immigrants are far less likely to choose naturalization than other immigrants, according to a new Pew report , which found that about two-thirds of the 5.4 million Mexican immigrants eligible to become U.S. citizens have not done so.\n\nLoading feed...\n\nThe report, \"The Path Not Taken,\" compared people from Mexico with eligible immigrants from other countries.\n\n36% vs. 68%\n\nMexican nationals versus people born elsewhere who beome U.S. citizens\n\nThat 32-percentage-point differential is significant, considering that Mexican immigrants account for one-third of the 12 million legal permanent residents in the United States, the largest of any ethnic group.\n\nThe low rate of naturalization isn't for lack of trying; a full nine in 10 Hispanic immigrants interviewed said they would naturalize if they could. When asked why they didn't, about 26 percent cited language or personal barriers and 18 percent cited financial or administrative issues. About 26 percent indicated they either haven't tried to become a U.S. citizen yet or weren't interested.\n\nThe naturalization rates indicate that a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the majority of whom come from Mexico, would not necessarily mean that they'll choose to become citizens, the Pew report found. Instead, illegal immigrants might opt to take the first step--becoming a legal permanent resident--which would remove the threat of deportation while allowing them to legally work.\n\nSome other findings from the report:\n\n56% of legal permanent residents in 2011 became U.S. citizens, the highest peak in 30 years, for a total of 15.5 million U.S. naturalized citizens that year.\n\n39% of the U.S. foreign-born population in 2011 were naturalized citizens. About 31 percent were legal residents, while an estimated 28 percent are undocumented.\n\n9.7 million permanent residents are eligible for naturalization. Mexican immigrants make up the largest share, at 36 percent.\n\n72% of legal permanent residents who are Mexican speak little to no English, compared with 69 percent of all legal immigrants. About 28 percent of legal Mexican immigrants speak English well.\n\n59% of legal Mexican immigrants have been in the U.S. for 20 years or more, compared with 47 percent of all legal immigrants.\n\n22% of naturalized Mexican immigrants, the largest share, said they chose U.S. citizenship for its civil and legal rights. In comparison, about 16 percent, the largest share, of other naturalized Latinos cited family as the reason they naturalized."

      "text": "Mexico Is Getting Better, and Fewer Mexicans Want to Leave\n\nWhy amnesty is not likely to cause a flood of immigrants.\n\nShortly after the new bipartisan immigration bill was released this week, one opponent, Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, said it contained \"a fatal flaw: \" the provision for a 10-year process through which some illegal immigrants could gain citizenship.\n\n\"It legalizes almost everyone in the country illegally, also known as amnesty, before it secures the border,\" Smith said. \"As a result, the Senate proposal issues an open invitation to enter the country illegally.\"\n\nSmith voices a common fear among border-security hawks: That any so-called \"amnesty\" or legalization plan will somehow spur more foreigners to make unauthorized dashes across the border. A recent poll by the Rasmussen company found that nearly half of respondents thought a pathway to citizenship would lead to more more illegal immigration.\n\nBut here's one thing that might allay those fears: Mexicans, who make up the plurality of illegal immigrants, are feeling better and better about their country, and fewer are interested in moving across the border.\n\nThough an estimated 300,000 people still enter the U.S. illegally each year, that represents a precipitous fall from the first half of the decade, when the number was 850,000. In 2010, net migration to and from Mexico was approximately zero .\n\nPart of the reason, of course, is the global economic downturn, which eliminated many of the low-wage job opportunities that Mexican immigrants might have come to the U.S. to seek.\n\nBut in addition to the U.S. becoming a less attractive destination, part of the explanation for the drop is that prospects in Mexico are actually looking up.\n\nEven though Mexico is clearly still struggling, there are signs that the country is gradually improving. Crime is down in border cities like Ciudad Juarez. Mexico's fertility rate is falling and its population is aging, meaning there are fewer young workers scrambling for jobs (half of all Mexican immigrants are under age 33 ). For the first time in decades, Mexico has a fledgling middle class . Its GDP growth rivals Brazil's , and economically, some economists think the country is doing even better than the United States. According to the OECD, Mexicans are about as satisfied with their lives as people in Iceland or Ireland are.\n\nFor just one example, we can look at the mean \"life today\" score, in which Gallup asks respondents to think of a ladder with 10 steps -- with each next step representing an improved overall situation -- and rank their lives as being on one of the ten steps. According to that score, Mexico's mean \"life today\" score is 7.1. In the U.S., it's 7.0. By comparison, in 2007, that number was 7.2 in the U.S. and just 6.6 in Mexico. Here's the latest view from Gallup , with the two countries nearly identical in their average life rank:\n\nAnd here it is from 2006/2007, with a stark difference between the U.S. and Mexico:\n\nMexicans are also more hopeful about the future these days. On average, Mexicans said their lives in five years would be a 7.6, using the ladder from the past example, and Americans said they would be a 7.9. In 2007, that difference was much larger -- 7.4 and 8.2, respectively. (At times, Mexicans have had even sunnier outlooks than Americans. In 2008, 80 percent of them said \"yes\" to the existential-sounding question, \"Would you like more days like yesterday?\" compared with 78 percent of people in the U.S.)\n\nOur neighbors south of the border are also more and more interested in staying put. In 2007, 21 percent of Mexicans said they wanted to move permanently to another country. Today, that number is 11 percent , the same as for U.S. residents:\n\nOf course, Mexico still faces a plethora of societal and economic challenges. Almost half its citizens live in poverty -- 11.7 million of them in extreme poverty , meaning they make the equivalent of less than $83 a month. Drug cartels sill run rampant. Banks there don't lend enough , which slows business growth. Prices are still too high because a handful of oligarchs control the country's largest industries.\n\nStill, it seems like many of the people who would have liked to move to the U.S. have already done so. The New York Times recently reported on one nearly empty Mexican town where few would-be immigrants remain:\n\nHomes await returning families, while dozens of schools have closed because of a lack of students. Here in El Cargadero, a once-thriving farm community of 3,000, only a few hundred people remain, at most.\n\nMany in the anti-amnesty crowd have said the U.S. needs stronger border security before any pathways to citizenship can begin. But the border might actually already be secure enough . There are more border agents now than ever before, but border apprehensions in 2011 were at a 40-year low, at roughly 340,000 per year. (They ticked up by 20,000 last year, but that's still dramatically lower than the pre-recession level of one million or more annually.)\n\nMeanwhile, stepped-up enforcement within the United States -- at worksites and elsewhere -- has led to a spike in deportation s. Mexican residents interviewed by the Times said that with the current enforcement levels, the journey north is too arduous and expensive to be worth the potential pitfalls. Attempts to cross the border might pick up as the U.S. economy improves, of course, but so might the trend of Mexicans staying put if opportunities there proliferate.\n\nWhat's more, s urveys of Mexican immigrants have found that the prospect of work, rather than legal status, was the main motivation for crossing illegally in the 1990s and 2000s. A 2011 study in the journal \"Public Purpose\" found that the amnesty programs are associated with a decline in the number of border apprehensions, a proxy for crossing attempts. A 2001 study by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank also showed that border apprehensions went down in the immediate aftermath of the implementation of an earlier amnesty program in 1986, and then simply returned to their previous, pre-amnesty levels:\n\nIf anything, IRCA reduced the number of illegal immigrants in the short run, perhaps because potential migrants thought that it would be more difficult to cross the border or to get a job in the United States after the law was passed. An amnesty program also does not appear to encourage illegal immigration in the long run in the hopes of another amnesty program.\n\nAbout 80 percent of all illegal immigration to the U.S. comes from Mexico and Latin America. At least at the moment, the changing demographics and economic trade-offs between Mexico and the United States means that a path to citizenship won't necessarily cause Mexicans to rush across the border en masse. Many of them have plenty to look forward to at home."

The movement included intellectuals, workers and others who opposed Mexico's dictatorial President Porfirio Díaz, who ruled for decades with support from the U.S. government and U.S. business elites. \"What we have is Latinx protagonists at the center of the American story,\" says Hernández, who teaches history, African American studies and urban planning at UCLA . \"If you want to understand the rise of U.S. empire, you want to understand U.S. immigration history, you want to understand the issues of policing we are confronting today, we have to know that these are Latinx histories.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nHere in the United States, many people marked Cinco de Mayo last week, May 5th, a holiday that commemorates Mexico's unexpected victory over France in the Battle of Puebla, May 5th, 1862, and is now mostly commemorated by Mexican Americans. The hero of that battle was Porfirio Díaz, who went on to rule as the longtime president of Mexico until he was toppled in the Mexican Revolution by people he called \"bad Mexicans.\" They're the focus of an incredible new book that explores the untold story of the Mexican Revolution and the men and women who incited it, and how it relates to the rise of U.S. imperialism and white supremacy.\n\nWe're joined right now by Kelly Lytle Hernández, professor of history, African American studies and urban planning at UCLA , author of the new book, just out today, titled Bad Mexicans: Race, Empire, and Revolution in the Borderlands . She's also the author of the award-winning books Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol and City of Inmates: Conquest, Rebellion, and the Rise of Human Caging in Los Angeles .\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! , Professor Lytle Hernández. Congratulations on the publication of your book today. You open your book with the story of a lynching. Tell us that story.\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: Sure. Well, first of all, thank you for having me on.\n\nSo, this book about a revolution in Mexico actually begins with a lynching in Texas in 1910, when a young man named Antonio Rodríguez was accused of murdering a white woman. And by the end of the day, a posse of white men and farmers and locals had found Antonio and dragged him by a lasso looped around his neck to a tree at the edge of town in Rocksprings, Texas, and they burned him alive. And that story of a lynching was part of a longer history of anti-Mexican violence, especially in Texas but across the borderlands, in which nearly 500 Mexicans were lynched between the 1870s and the 1920s. And all of this racial violence that Mexicans and Mexican Americans were experiencing was part of the uprising that led to the 1910 Mexican Revolution.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor, I'm wondering if you could talk somewhat - your book deals with an important period of history, not only in Mexico but in the United States, as well, which I sometimes refer to as the second conquest of Mexico, the first being the U.S.-Mexican War. But then there was that period in the late 19th century of the invasion of U.S. capital into Mexico during the Porfirio Díaz dictatorship. If you could talk about that and how that actually set up, was the basis for the Mexican Revolution?\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: That's right. And, Juan, you certainly have been one of the scholars and journalists to help us to understand this.\n\nSo, once we have the completion of the transcontinental railroad here in the United States in 1876, major U.S. investors, some of the most famous robber barons, begin looking around and trying to figure out what comes next. And they make a decision. They make a set of agreements with the Porfirio Díaz regime in Mexico to extend U.S. investments into Mexico. And that begins with building a railroad that connects central Mexico to the United States in the 1880s. Following the construction of that railroad, U.S. dollars flood into Mexico and purchase up about 130 million acres of land, nearly a quarter of the Mexican land base, and U.S. investors come to dominate key Mexican industries - railroads, oil, mining and more.\n\nAnd it's that invasion of U.S. dollars, also European dollars, that displaces millions of Mexican peasants. Community folks, rural folks, Indigenous populations become displaced, become wage workers. And then they begin to migrate into the United States in search of work. And this is actually the beginning of mass labor migration between Mexico and the United States. So, for us to understand the major demographic shifts that have happened in the 20th century of the United States, which is, in particular, the browning of America, we have to go back to the Porfirio Díaz regime and understand how it operated within the context of the rise of U.S. imperialism in the late 19th century.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you also focus, in your book, on a revolutionary that gets very little - who has gotten very little attention here in the United States, Ricardo Flores Magón, and his brothers, the Magonistas, this incredible group of anarchists who spent so many years here in the U.S. Talk about their role and why you felt it was important to focus on the U.S. government's collusion with the Mexican government to stamp out revolutionary ideas of Mexicans right here in the U.S.\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: Oh, that's a great question. So, of course, Ricardo Flores Magón, his brothers and the people who worked with them, the Magonistas, are legendary in Mexico. In fact, the Mexican government declared this year, 2022, to be the year of Ricardo Flores Magón. It's the centennial of his death in Leavenworth prison in 1922.\n\nAnd so, who was Ricardo Flores Magón? Ricardo was, in fact, a journalist who had been writing in Mexico City against Porfirio Díaz, called him a dictator, an autocrat, that he had made Mexicans the servants of foreigners. And it was this kind of language, this kind of talk, in a dictatorship, that Porfirio Díaz could not suffer. And so he attempted to suppress the Magonistas, Ricardo Flores Magón and the other journalists in Mexico. He had them arrested numerous times, imprisoned in this horrible prison, Belem Prison in Mexico City, and even issued a gag rule against them and prohibited any newspaper in Mexico from publishing their words. And once that gag rule is issued in 1903, Ricardo Flores Magón and his motley band of journalists cross the border into the United States to continue their writing. They relaunch their newspaper. They actually establish a political party, the Partido Liberal Mexicano, the PLM . And they form an army. And by 1908, this PLM army had raided Mexico four times and really destabilized the Díaz regime.\n\nAnd it's that activity, that foment, that social movement that the Magonistas were building, here in the United States and across the borderlands, that brought the Díaz regime together with the United States government to try to stop them from inciting an all-out revolution in Mexico. Now, the U.S. government gets involved because of all those investments by major U.S. investors in Mexico. They wanted to protect those investments. So the U.S. Department of War, Department of Labor, the Immigration Service, the Postal Service, U.S. Marshals and a bevy of spies all get involved in a cross-border counterinsurgency campaign to try to suppress the Magonistas' uprising. They wanted to extradite, to deport, to imprison or to kidnap as many Magonistas as possible. And Ricardo Flores Magón, in fact, is imprisoned for at least three years in the United States between 1907 and 1910. However, the Magonistas persevered, and they were able to incite the outbreak of the 1910 Mexican Revolution.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what happened a hundred years ago, Professor Kelly Lytle Hernández, in 1915, El Plan de San Diego, one of the largest and deadliest uprisings against white settler supremacy in the U.S., openly recruiting African Americans and Japanese immigrants to their ranks? And then talk about La Matanza.\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: That's right. So, the Magonistas' uprising leads to the outbreak of the 1910 revolution. And then, because Ricardo Flores Magón isn't really a military leader - he is more of an intellectual, a belligerent - the Magonistas' campaign begins to decline as the revolution takes off under the leadership of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata and many other people and names that we're familiar with here in the United States.\n\nHowever, amidst of the revolution, in 1915, a group of Mexican radicals begin to think about, \"Well, we've unseated Díaz here, and we're beginning to pursue a social and economic revolution here in Mexico. Why don't we also turn north and see what's possible in terms of unseating white settler supremacy up north?\" And so they cross into the United States in the summer of 1915. They recruit African Americans and Japanese immigrants and others into an army for all peoples and liberation of all peoples. And they begin to march across South Texas with the goal of assassinating every white male the age 16 and over. And they do this, and they rip up railroad tracks, and they do kill several people. And that's El Plan de San Diego. They wanted to end white settler supremacy. And the first lands that they were going to free, they were going to give to African Americans as a sanctuary from white supremacy. The next sets of lands that they were going to liberate, they were going to give to Indigenous populations as a sanctuary from settler supremacy.\n\nHowever, the blowback against their uprising was extraordinary. And so, after El Plan de San Diego began in the summer of 1915, posses and vigilantes, the U.S. Department of War began to crush the uprising. And people have estimated that anywhere between 300 and even up to 5,000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans were lynched and murdered across South Texas as a repercussion for El Plan de San Diego. Now, scholars call that mass murder of 1915 and 1916 La Matanza, The Massacre.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I'm wondering if you could - your book also deals with the impact of both the migrations during the Porfirio Díaz dictatorship and then, of course, the tens of thousands that left Mexico during the revolution into the United States. The impact of that labor force on the American West, if you could talk about that, as well?\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: Absolutely. So, the revolution itself was - it lasted for seven years, and it was extraordinarily violent, and it pushed about a million Mexicans to become refugees into the United States. And it's that major transition of the Mexican population into the United States that becomes the foundation for the growth of the Mexican American population for decades and decades to come. You know, across the country today, if you talk to folks who are of Mexican descent, many people will track their family story back to the Mexican Revolution. So that is a major moment in U.S. history, that it transforms our demographics. By 2010, Mexico had become the primary sending place for migrants to the United States, which had replaced European nations as being sort of the font of immigration to the United States. We now have estimates, by 2040, 2045, the United States will be a majority nonwhite population, with Mexicans and Mexican Americans and Latinx folks, in general, in the lead of that major demographic revolution. All of this tracks back to the age of Porfirio Díaz and the Mexican Revolution and the ways in which U.S. empire and revolution shifted a major segment of the Mexican population into the United States.\n\nNow, one important thing to remember here, of course, is that the migration of Mexicans into the United States was not just another immigrant story. This is a story of a nonwhite population that runs headfirst into webs of white supremacy across the United States. And there's a particular form of white supremacy that's developed across the southwestern United States that Mexican immigrants confront, and that's called Juan Crow. Obviously, it's aligned with Jim Crow occurring throughout the U.S. South but also across the United States. It's forms of segregation in housing and in schooling. It's lower wages, more dangerous jobs. It's an immigration regime that's beginning to build in the early 20th century that targets people from Mexico, in particular, but nonwhite migrants from south of the border and Asian immigrants, as well. And it's also, as we talked about before, the extraordinary levels of racial violence that Mexicans and Mexican Americans were confronting here in the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You talk about the three Rs of U.S. history - race, rebellion and repression - and how - going back to the Mexican Revolution, going back to the Magonistas, how the Magonistas opened a new chapter of policing in the United States. Stopping the uprising was one of the FBI's first objectives. So, talk about how that uprising led to the surveillance on the border that we see today, in the borderlands, where you, too, grew up.\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: That's right. Thanks for asking that question.\n\nSo, the Magonistas, who had their army, launched several raids into Mexico from Texas. There was a raid in 1906 into Jiménez, Mexico. But there were also three very deadly raids that happened in June of 1908. And those raids resulted in the death of dozens of people and really became news around the world of people beginning to wonder: Can Porfirio Díaz actually suppress this uprising? Are our investments safe in Mexico? And so it destabilized his regime.\n\nAnd just a couple days after those raids into Mexico, between about June 25th and June 28th of 1908, the United States government, led by Theodore Roosevelt and the U.S. Attorney General Charles Bonaparte, established a new federal police force to enforce national or federal law. And that police force was the Bureau of Investigation. Now, Teddy Roosevelt first imagined the Bureau of Investigation really to go out and to prosecute or arrest folks for violating land law in the American West. But very quickly, after those raids of 1908, they pivot, and they turn the FBI into a counterinsurgency superforce targeting the Magonistas. And so, the FBI , one of its very first big cases is tracking down members of the PLM army and having them arrested and imprisoned across the United States. And there are dozens, if not hundreds, of Magonistas who are imprisoned following the 1908 raids.\n\nSo, one of the things that's really important in the story is that when we think about the rise of the FBI and the rise of policing in 20th century U.S. history, we often don't think about Mexican Americans in that story or Mexican immigrants in the story. But, in fact, the FBI took some of its first breaths and cut its teeth on policing Mexicans and trying to suppress radical Latinx voices and a social movement that was growing across the borderlands.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And we only have about 30 seconds, but the main lesson for today for those reading your book?\n\nKELLY LYTLE HERNÁNDEZ: The main lesson for today is, what we have is Latinx protagonists at the center of the American story, that if you want to understand the rise of U.S. empire, you want to understand U.S. immigration history, if you want to understand the issues of policing that we're confronting today, we have to know that these are Latinx histories. There are Latinx protagonists at the center of the story. And here is just one example that's dramatic and cinematic, and I hope that this becomes an entry point for more readers across the United States to open up their lens to understand that Latinx histories are critical, central and pivotal to the U.S. story.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kelly Lytle Hernández, we want to thank you so much for being with us, author of the new book, out today, Bad Mexicans: Race, Empire, and Revolution in the Borderlands .

Constituting one-fifth of the city's population, Chicago's Mexican residents are significant contributors to the area's economy, but the workforce is disproportionately concentrated in some of the most dangerous, difficult, low-paying jobs. \"The character of the Chicago working class has dramatically changed and is heavily Mexican,\" says González. He adds that \"Mexican migration saved Chicago\" from the kind of post-industrial decline plaguing other cities like Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe end today's show with a major new report on Chicago, where one in five people identify as Mexican, but they've been largely overlooked, from politics to pop culture to academia - until now. Our own Juan González co-wrote the report, \"Fuerza Mexicana: The Past, Present, and Power of Mexicans in Chicagoland.\"\n\nJuan, talk about the significance of this report. You've just come off of a week of presenting it, from legislators throughout Illinois to all sorts of politicians and people on the ground in Chicago.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yes, Amy. Well, as part of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois Chicago, we were asked by a group of Mexican leaders of nonprofit organizations in the city to try to put together data specifically on the Mexican community, not the general Latino community, because, unfortunately, most of the data collected by government agencies and research studies are under the umbrella of Hispanics or Latinos, and those are people from more than 20 different countries in Latin America, and they generally don't zero in on the specific condition of each of these ethnic groups. And the reality is that the Mexican community in the United States represents about 60% of all Latinos, but in places like Chicago, it's up to 75% of all the Latinos in the Chicago area are of Mexican descent. Yet there's no data on what the condition of the Mexican community specifically is. So we tried to put together in this report the first attempt specifically to disaggregate data among Latino communities and focus on the Mexican community in particular.\n\nAnd we issued the report actually last week on the anniversary of Mexican independence, September 16th, but it also has another significance in Chicago specifically, because it was 70 years ago last week, on September 16th, 1954, that the federal government launched Operation Wetback in Chicago. It had been launched in the Southwest earlier. But on that day, the INS swept through the city of Chicago, grabbing up Mexicans wherever they could to initiate a mass deportation. And if it sounds familiar, it's because this has happened repeatedly throughout U.S. history, of mass deportations of Mexicans, beginning with the Hoover administration in the 1930s, the Eisenhower administration in 1954, then the Bush administration with their raids in the early 2000s, the Obama administration with their mass deportations. So this has been a regular feature of American history. So, we issued it on that day specifically to say, \"Look, all of these mass deportations have occurred, and yet the Mexican community in the United States has continued to grow and has become pivotal.\"\n\nSo, I think the key things that we - there's lots of data in the report for people who are into, the nerds that are into data. But I think the major issues that we tried to present is, one, that the Mexican community of Chicago, of Chicagoland, and which is more than 1.5 million people, is not a new community - it's actually been in existence for more than a hundred years, especially in the city of Chicago - and that it's been critical to the vibrancy of Chicago, especially in the postindustrial age. When the manufacturing declined, it was really the growth of the Mexican community that allowed Chicago to have experienced an enormous renaissance.\n\nAnd just to give you an example of the level of involvement of the Mexican community in Chicago's renaissance, for example, today, 51% of all the construction laborers in Chicago are of Mexican origin. So all of the skyscrapers and condominiums that have been refurbished and rebuilt have been built on the backs of low-paid construction laborers of Mexican origin. Seventy-one percent of the landscapers in the city are of Mexican origin, 49% of the carpenters, 44% of all the cooks in the hotels and the restaurants. Fifty-six percent of all the auto mechanics in Chicago are of Mexican origin. And 36% of the factory workers, those who are still working in factories, in Chicago are of Mexican origin. So, really, the entire - the character of the Chicago working class has dramatically changed, and it's heavily Mexican. And in fact, there's an entire Brown Belt within Chicago of a dozen neighborhoods on the Southwest Side that are over majority Mexican.\n\nSo, there's been - in effect, Mexican migration saved Chicago. And unlike cities like Detroit or Indianapolis or Cleveland, that also experienced postindustrial decline but never welcomed in large numbers of Latinos, by Chicago welcoming in Latinos, and specifically Mexicans, it has been able to revitalize itself. So, I think that's one of the key things.\n\nThe other thing that's important to understand is the dispersion of the Mexican population. Two-thirds of all of the Mexicans, of those 1.5 million Mexicans, are not in the city of Chicago. They're in the suburbs and in the collar counties of Chicago. And there are now more than a dozen suburban towns around Chicago that have more than 50% Latino population, yet they have no Latino elected officials at the mayoralty levels or proportionally in the city councils. So the future of political representation and power of the Mexican and Latino community is really in the suburbs of Chicago. And that's true in cities across the country. It is in the suburbs that are the growth areas.\n\nThe other important thing is that the - because the community is so young, the college-age population has dramatically changed. Thirty-two percent of all the college and graduate professional school students in Chicago are Latino - 32,000 of them, including 20,000 Mexicans - which means that's the future of higher education for not only Chicago, but for many cities across the country. So, these are just some of the findings that we had in this report.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Juan, we're going to link to your report . Juan González co-wrote the report, \"Fuerza Mexicana: The Past, Present, and Power of Mexicans in Chicagoland,\" for the Great Cities Institute at UIC . That does it for our show. Juan is also the author of Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America .\n\nHappy birthday, Hana Elias! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Using Facebook, he joined the III % United Patriots militia, which operates in more than a dozen states. He then traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to join the militia on a citizen vigilante mission aimed at catching undocumented immigrants. Wearing a hidden camera, he captured collaboration between the paramilitary groups and the U.S. Border Patrol. \"Right now we have 270 militias across the country,\" Bauer notes. \"A lot of states have laws that ban militia training or paramilitary training. There have been no cases of these laws being enforced.\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to a stunning new exposé for Mother Jones magazine looking at America's resurgent paramilitary movement.\n\nSHANE BAUER : We have, throughout the country, groups of armed men, mostly white men, that see themselves as a defense against the federal government.\n\nERIC SHAWN : Armed protesters are vowing to occupy a federal building in Oregon for as long as it takes.\n\nTONY DOKOUPIL : Three members of a right-wing militia were arrested.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW : Armed supporters pointing guns at federal law enforcement officers.\n\nSHANE BAUER : A lot of these militias were born, basically, after Obama got elected. The initial movement in the '90s died down after George Bush was elected, and as soon as we elected the first black president, membership skyrocketed.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Mother Jones senior reporter Shane Bauer went undercover to report on a right-wing militia movement. Using Facebook, he joined the III % United Patriots militia, which operates in more than a dozen states. Bauer traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to join the militia on Operation Spring Break, a citizen vigilante mission aimed at catching undocumented immigrants. In a video accompanying the piece, Bauer explains how he landed the job using his own name and personal information, despite his years as an award-winning journalist.\n\nSHANE BAUER : When I set up my Facebook page and whenever I reached out to these guys, I used my real name. Had they googled me, they would have seen that I was a senior reporter at Mother Jones , and they probably would not have allowed me into their organization. ...\n\nThere's armed guards at the base, guys with AR-15s kind of patrolling it. I just kind of rolled up, had my camo on. They didn't really ask any questions. These guys were really amped up. And a lot of them were military veterans that had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was always worried when I was out on these things that we're going to actually run into somebody. My understanding was that if we did run into somebody, we were to call the base, and the base would call the Border Patrol. We're not supposed to shoot anybody, unless somebody shoots at us. But when we're going out on these operations, guys are talking about hunting Mexicans. I mean, the stuff they're saying is like-it doesn't-it's not hard to imagine a situation in which they're shooting somebody.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, for more, we're going to Berkeley, California. Shane Bauer joins us to discuss this exposé . It's headlined \"Undercover with a Border Militia.\" It was funded in part by the Puffin Foundation.\n\nShane, welcome back to Democracy Now! Explain exactly where you went and who these people were.\n\nSHANE BAUER : Thanks for having me, Amy. I, initially, actually, joined a couple of militias in California and was training with them for several months, but my main interest was on a kind of new phenomenon of nationally organized militias. The III % United Patriots is probably the largest of these groups. And I saw that they were having an operation on the border, so I traveled down to the border.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain that name, the 3 percent.\n\nSHANE BAUER : Yeah, they're part-the III % United Patriots are part of a larger movement that calls itself the Three Percenter movement. This movement was born after Obama's election. And they believe that the American Revolution was won by 3 percent of the population. And the idea is that if they can get 3 percent of the population behind them, then they can restore the Bill of Rights. That's kind of how they look at their work.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And do these paramilitary organizations tend to have a disproportionate number of military veterans? And if so, Shane Bauer, why do you think that is?\n\nSHANE BAUER : You know, it varies from group to group. The Three Percenter groups, in particular, do have a lot of military veterans. When I was on this border operation, I had-you know, one military Marine veteran told me that he considered this therapy. He said it reminded him a lot of Afghanistan. And I had heard from a number of these guys that when they left the military, they missed the kind of sense of camaraderie that they found in the military. I kind of had the sense that they came back home and didn't find what they had hoped, and they had felt somewhat alienated. And in the militia, they kind of, you know, have a-get a sense of what they had in the military. A lot of these guys also seemed to be pretty disillusioned with the military leadership and had a sense of loyalty to their former soldiers, but were generally very skeptical and frustrated with the federal government itself.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, talk about where you went. But first I want to play this video clip that accompanies your report at Mother Jones , together with Fusion, the militia group unexpectedly meeting up with U.S. Border Patrol in the dark, after a few tense moments, recognizing one another. This is a Border Patrol agent, who identifies himself as an intelligence officer, speaking to the militia after the encounter, followed by your commentary.\n\nBORDER PATROL AGENT : [inaudible] give you a heads-up next time you guys are going to come down? If you want to come-if you plan on coming down to the Nogales area, since you're out in Cal-or Colorado, hitch a ride, take a trip out there, maybe give you guys an unauthorized brief.\n\nMILITIA MEMBER : All right.\n\nBORDER PATROL AGENT : So, you didn't hear none of that [bleep] from me.\n\nSHANE BAUER : I was really surprised to see how much the Border Patrol was cooperating with these guys-\n\nBORDER PATROL AGENT : And then, when you all get down here, I'll link up with you again.\n\nSHANE BAUER : -to see-kind of be inside that world and see the ways that these guys are talking about hunting Mexicans and that kind of stuff-\n\nMILITIA MEMBER : That's what you've got to carry. It's [bleep] light.\n\nSHANE BAUER : -and then to see federal law enforcement not only tolerate them, but kind of use them in a certain way.\n\nBORDER PATROL AGENT : I love having y'all out here, man. Like I said before, it impresses me that you guys come out to do my job for me for no pay at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wow, so there you have it, Shane. That was a Border Patrol agent saying, \"It impresses me that you're coming here to do my job for no pay at all.\" Talk about what they were doing together, what the Border Patrol told them to do-for example, if they see water in the desert, bottles of water that perhaps were left for migrants, to dump it?\n\nSHANE BAUER : Yeah. So, we were out in near Nogales, Arizona, about an hour from Nogales, way out in the middle of the desert, I mean, pretty much as remote as you can get. And I saw many interactions between the militia and the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol would come to the militia base, sometimes bring us doughnuts. And in this particular case, when we saw this man who said that he was an intelligence officer, he was directing us where to set up to find people crossing the border. He actually took us to show us the exact locations where they said that we should set up.\n\nAnd I later-before publishing this story, I reached out to the leadership of the III % United Patriots, who I was with on the border, and I spoke to the leader, Mike Morris, and I asked him about his relationship with the Border Patrol. He said that he was still, now that he's back in Colorado, was in contact with the Border Patrol on a weekly basis, and that whenever they set up an operation, they talk to the Border Patrol, and the Border Patrol will tell them when to come down and where to set up. In that particular interaction, the Border Patrol was telling us to destroy food and water that we found in the desert. And I saw that happen out in the desert.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Shane Bauer, could you talk about how militia members receive training, and by whom and what kind of training? One person you spoke to, Showtime, told you that waterboarding and tasing are part of their training. So could you say a little about that?\n\nSHANE BAUER : Yeah, so, right now we have more than 270 militias across the country, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. These militias, you know, most of them are not doing these kind of border operations but are more kind of regionally focused. But, you know, a core part of being in a militia is doing this kind of paramilitary training. So, there-you know, guys get together at least once a month, sometimes every week, depending on the group, and do kind of small group infantry-type training.\n\nThe III % United Patriots, in particular, also have-they have their own kind of special forces within the militia. And they described to me, when I was in Arizona, some of that training, which involves a kind of 36-hour-long stretch where new members, new recruits, are put in a scenario where they're told that they have been captured by a border cartel. They are sleep-deprived for 36 hours. They're waterboarded. They described putting people in what they call stress boxes, and naked except for a T-shirt out in the Colorado winter, and are tased and sometimes cattle-prodded through holes in the box. They even described one instance in which a man, who they were doing this mock interrogation with, wouldn't speak, and they brought in a female member of the militia and said if he wouldn't speak, they would tase her. And the man who told me this story said that he proceeded to tase this woman and then cattle-prod her.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk-\n\nSHANE BAUER : And I also witnessed them-I mean, they told the Border Patrol also about these trainings and kind of were boasting about it. And Border-this intelligence officer of the Border Patrol was just kind of laughing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the legality of these militias and all the states that they're operating in, how heavily armed people are.\n\nSHANE BAUER : So, these militias, they call themselves militias because they're associating themselves with the militia of the Revolutionary War and the kind of period after the Revolutionary War. And there have been laws that have carried over and stay on the books from that time, a time when states and the federal government were requiring every white male to be a part of the militia. They are essentially, you know, pointing to these old laws and saying that we are this militia. The issue is that a lot of states have laws that ban militia training or paramilitary training. These laws have never-there have been no cases of these laws being enforced.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, earlier this month-I want to ask about another militia-three members of a Kansas militia, known as the Crusaders, were arrested for plotting to blow up an apartment complex in Kansas that is home to many Somali refugees and houses a mosque. All three militia members were white men in their late forties. According to the FBI , the militia supported anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-government beliefs. Shane Bauer, could you say whether you think that's representative of most militia groups? Who are they fighting against in addition to the federal government?\n\nSHANE BAUER : Look, these militias and their members are-all have kind of different motives. The kind of common thread is that they see themselves as a defense against what they call the tyranny of the federal government. Many of them would also say their primary focus is to prepare for disasters, whether it be a natural disaster or, you know, kind of civil unrest. A lot of them will talk about Black Lives Matter. They talk a lot about Islamic terrorism. And, you know, they will say that they are not racist. They are not white supremacists in the sense that we think of. However, it is very common to hear and to see in social media anti-Muslim rhetoric and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nYou know, I think most militias would distance themselves from the act that you just described. Many of them actually distance themselves from what happened in Burns, Oregon, recently. But there are a pretty large number of cases in the past five or 10 years of militia factions kind of going off and planning terrorist attacks. Many have been thwarted by the FBI . There have also been-there also was a case not very long ago in Georgia of a militia killing three people. A militia leader killed his wife for life insurance money and put that money into buying arms for his militia. And he ended-two members of the militia ended up killing two people that they believed knew too much. So, you know, the movement is very fractured, and there ends up being kind of small groups that, you know, are very isolated. And, you know, there is a risk of these smaller groups kind of going off on their own.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Shane, we have to leave it there, but it is a fascinating investigation, undercover operation. Shane Bauer, award-winning senior reporter at Mother Jones . We'll link to your piece , \"Undercover with a Border Militia.\"\n\nAnd that does it for the show. I'll be speaking tonight at Arizona, Tempe, Arizona , at Arizona State University, Carson Ballroom, 7:00 p.m. Check our website.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Historian Ana Raquel Minian, who studies the history of immigration, says earlier mass deportation programs in the 1930s and '50s led to widespread abuse, tearing many families apart through violent means that also resulted in the expulsion of many U.S. citizens. \"These deportations that Trump is claiming that he will do will have mass implications to our civil rights, to our communities and to our economy, and of course to the people who are being deported themselves,\" says Minian. She also says that while Trump's extremist rhetoric encourages hate and violence against vulnerable communities, in terms of policy there is great continuity with the Biden administration, which kept many of the same policies in place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We end today's show looking at Donald Trump's threat to deport as many as 20 million immigrants living in the United States. It's a threat he repeated on an almost daily basis on the campaign trail, including at the Republican National Convention.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : That's why, to keep our families safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country, even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate, but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation we've ever had.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by a historian who's closely studied past mass deportation programs in the United States. Ana Raquel Minian is an associate professor of history at Stanford University and the author of In the Shadow of Liberty: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States Their recent piece for Dissent magazine is titled \"Trump's Deportation Model.\"\n\nSo, Professor Minian, if you can start off by talking about Trump's victory, what that model is, and, you know, his famous motto, \"Make America great again\"? Go back in history and talk about the mass deportations of people in the United States.\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : Thank you.\n\nIn many ways, we think that Trump is a new model, a person who completely goes against the grain of American history in terms of deportations, in terms of his treatment of immigrants. But as he noted himself, that is absolutely not true.\n\nWhat he was referring to when he spoke about Eisenhower was an operation that occurred in 1954 titled Operation Wetback. And this was a massive deportation campaign. The tactics were military tactics. They brought tanks. They brought Border Patrol people all throughout the border, airplanes. People were grabbed from their houses and taken to the border, stopped outside of their jobs and taken to the border. Their families didn't know where they had been. It was a very cruel operation. In the year 1954, the year of Operation Wetback, over 1 million people were deported. And this is the model that Trump says that he is going to expand.\n\nAnd it comes at huge costs to America, to its communities and to the people themselves. In the United States, when Operation Wetback happened, communities were destroyed. People were left without central members, without churchgoers, without breadwinners. Families came to [inaudible]. Families who relied on some of the folks who were deported had to either rely on welfare or find jobs immediately. Children were left without parents. Many jobs, many employers needed workers who were deported. It was bad for the U.S. economy. It was also bad for American civil rights. Many Mexican Americans, people who were born in the United States, could be walking through the streets and considered to be Mexican just because they, quote-unquote, \"looked Mexican,\" and their civil rights were not protected. Their constitutional rights were not protected.\n\nThe deportation of American citizens is something that we have seen over and over again. For example, in the 1930s, there was also a massive deportation campaign against Mexicans. It occurred, of course, during the Great Depression. We estimate that from 350,000 to a million people were deported and that over 60% of those were American citizens. These deportations that Trump is claiming that he will do will have mass implications to our civil rights, to our communities and to our economy, and of course to the people who are being deported themselves.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And if you could explain? If you could put that in the context of more recent history? In other words, how does Trump's proposal - or, in fact, what is actual policies that he implemented in the four years he was in power, from 2016 - on immigration, how do they compare with what the Biden administration did and what Kamala Harris said herself, since it was also central to her, immigration border security was also central to her campaign?\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : Absolutely. In many ways, the Biden administration also led an extremely anti-immigrant movement. His administration first continued the \"return to Mexico\" policy, continued Title 42. What did these policies do? These policies meant that either asylum seekers could not even apply for asylum in the United States, even though asylum is something that we abide to because of our own national law and because of international agreements, and it said that - and the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy said that if we were to accept asylum seekers to apply for asylum, they had to wait while their cases were adjudicated in northern Mexico. While people waited in northern Mexico for either Title 42 to go away or for the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy to be allowed in, people lived in terrible encampments where they were regularly raped, tortured, mugged. It was absolutely brutal, the conditions there. In fact, I once interviewed a woman who had fostered a child during Trump's zero-tolerance policy, the policy that Trump implemented that separated children from their parents while in detention. And this woman, who had fostered one of these little kids who was separated from his father while crossing the border because of the Trump administration, said, \"Right now the Biden administration's 'Remain in Mexico' policy is basically a zero-tolerance policy in reverse.\" Why? The conditions in northern Mexico were so brutal that some parents made the heart-wrenching decision of sending their children across the border, because unaccompanied minors were the only ones who could get into the United States while their parents had to wait in northern Mexico. Even recently, the Biden campaign has dramatically reduced the number of asylum seekers who can come into the country. These policies have been devastating to asylum seekers and migrants.\n\nBut there is, I believe, a big difference between what Trump did and what Biden did, even if not so much numerically. The rhetoric that Trump implemented, the anti-immigrant discourse, calling Mexicans \"animals,\" all Central Americans as belonging to MS-13, calling people rapists, that is not something that we heard so much from the Biden administration or from Kamala Harris's campaign. And that rhetoric matters. That rhetoric leads to violence in Latino communities, and eventually it also pushes people, administrations, to move further and further toward anti-immigrant policies. Additionally, Trump's family separation policy was explicitly created for purposes of deterrence. What does this mean? Trump implemented the zero-tolerance policy to cause harm to asylum seekers in order to warn other asylum seekers not to try to come into the United States. The very purpose of this policy was to cause harm. This is different from the policies that Biden has implemented and that Kamala Harris promised to implement, as well, even though they, too, would have created massive harm.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And if you could say, given all of that, especially what you said the distinctions are between Kamala and Biden and Trump - you know, so many exit polls have found, across the board, there was an increase in the number of votes for Trump, and obviously Latinx community is a massive and highly diverse community, but among this community, however defined, there was also an increase in the number of people who voted for Trump. How do you understand that?\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : I do want to emphasize your first point, which is: Why are we even thinking of a Latinx community when we think of votes? We know, for example, that Cubans have regularly voted Republican, that Mexicans have switched back and forth. So, I have been a little disturbed by this concept of a Latinx community and the blame that has been put on this community for the election of Trump nowadays.\n\nBut there is a history that we must understand. For example, if we look at the Mexican American community, right now the biggest Latinx community is of Mexicans. And Mexicans have changed - Mexican Americans have changed their views around migration many times. Up until the 1970s, most Mexican Americans viewed immigrants as a huge problem. Why? When immigrants arrived in the United States, they were cast as bringing disease, bringing crime - just like nowadays. And so, Mexican Americans had an option. One of these options was to say, \"Look, we are not them. We don't want them here. If they don't come, we won't be stereotyped as criminals. We won't be stereotyped as bringing in disease. Stop them from coming.\" So this was a very common speech and rhetoric of the Mexican American community up until the 1970s. This type of rhetoric began to change -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.\n\nANA RAQUEL MINIAN : - because of the civil rights movement - because of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, when Mexican Americans said, \"Actually, these people are our brethren. We are still being discriminated. Instead of stopping their discrimination - instead of fighting for them not to come, let us say they should not be discriminated, either.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ana Raquel Minian, we have to leave it there, and we thank you so much for being with us, associate professor of history at Stanford University, author of In the Shadow of Liberty: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States .

Last week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump wants to, quote, \"take the shackles off\" of the nation's immigration agents.\n\nPRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER : The president wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies and say, \"You have a mission. There are laws that need to be followed. You should do your mission and follow the law.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Last Thursday, President Trump called his deportation plans a military operation during a meeting with manufacturing CEOs.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You see what's happening at the border. All of a sudden, for the first time, we're getting gang members out. We're getting drug lords out. We're getting really bad dudes out of this country and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before. And they're the bad ones. And it's a military operation, because what has been allowed to come into our country, when you see gang violence that you've read about like never before and all of the things, much of that is people that are here illegally. And they're rough, and they're tough, but they're not tough like our people. So we're getting them out.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, this is not the first time people of Mexican descent have been demonized, accused of stealing jobs, and forced to leave the country. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, more than a million people residing in the United States were deported to Mexico. Some estimate as much as 60 percent of them were U.S. citizens of Mexican descent.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 2003, then-California state Senator Joe Dunn held hearings in Sacramento, where survivors gave testimony about what happened to them during the forced expulsions, which the government called repatriations. This is Senator Dunn stressing the importance of the hearing.\n\nSEN . JOE DUNN : The idea from which this nation was born was the promise to all of liberty and justice. Today we examine a tragic part of American history where we betrayed the justice part of that promise, and a betrayal that affected a staggering number of individuals. By some estimates, almost 2 million individuals were deported from the United States in the 1930s. Some estimate that almost 60 percent of those that were deported were United States citizens. And they were deported for but one reason: They just happened to be of Mexican descent.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The state of California went on to issue a formal apology for its role in the expulsions and built a memorial in downtown Los Angeles to commemorate the victims. But many fear that history is now on the verge or repeating itself already.\n\nFor more, we're going to Los Angeles, California, where we're joined by the preeminent scholar on this often overlooked chapter of American history: Francisco Balderrama, professor of American history and Chicano studies at California State University, Los Angeles. He's the co-author of the book Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s .\n\nProfessor Balderrama, thank you so much for joining us. I think, for many, especially young people, but I am sure many more, do not know this chapter of American history. Can you lay it out for us, what actually happened?\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : You're right that it's largely not known-and that's in the larger American society, the Mexican nation, as well as in the Mexican community itself-that this occurred during the Great Depression, a period of vast unemployment and underemployment, that at least over a million-Joe Dunn thinks in terms of maybe almost 2 million-individuals, Mexican nationals and American citizens of Mexican descent, were swept up and expelled out of this country. And it covered the entire United States. From Alabama and Mississippi to Alaska, from Los Angeles to New York, this mass expulsion occurred, and of a population that included Mexican nationals, many of them that had lived in this country 20, 30 years, but increasingly important is the 60 percent or more of American citizens of Mexican descent. In other words, what occurred here was unconstitutional deportation.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Professor Balderrama, I'm wondering if you could talk also about the role of the press at that time in stirring up anti-immigrant fervor, because this began during the Hoover administration and then moved on into the Roosevelt administration. What was the role of the press, as well?\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Well, the role of the press is significant, but it is also reflecting the larger American society at this time, as well. The key notion that the press puts forward is that a Mexican is a Mexican. There is no distinction in terms of residents in this country-as I mentioned earlier, many of them had lived in this country 20, 25 years, most of them were documented, most of them had papers-and that their children that were born in this country were U.S. citizens. No distinctions made. And that is accepted in this society and serves as a way of looking at the population, that even though they had contributed during better times to the economic prosperity of the United States, that now that's not recognized. They are the other, so to speak.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Ignacio Piña, who lived in rural Idaho when sheriffs came to his house and took everybody in custody in the summer of 1931. His parents had lived in the United States for some 25 years. He was about to enter first grade. We're taking this from a film called A Forgotten Injustice . A now-elderly Piña describes what happened that day.\n\nIGNACIO PIÑA: [translated] My mother was cooking and hand-making flour tortillas. I remember we were eating them with melted butter. Then, all of a sudden, they arrived. They pointed their guns at us. One officer was standing outside. The other one was inside. And they said, \"Come on, let's go. Come on.\" And my mother would ask, \"Where?\" \"No questions. Come on. Out!\"\n\nThey took us to the fields where my father was working. They grabbed him, too, and then they filled up the other car with Mexicans that were working there, as well.\n\nIn Pocatello, Idaho, they put us in jail. We were in jail for six or seven days. I was six years old. And as a kid, I could not understand why we were in jail if we were not criminals. My father was in one cell, and my mother was in another one with me, my three sisters and my two brothers. But I could not understand why.\n\nEven when we were in the train on our way to El Paso, Texas, I wondered, \"Where is this train going? What's going to happen with us?\" There were about five cars with lots of Mexicans, lots of families. We were so young, but I remember looking around at the people. They looked so sad, because many were suffering the same things we were facing. They were kicked out, too.\n\nThey did it so we couldn't come back, even the ones that were born here, like us. They didn't let us take anything with us, not even our birth certificates.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Not even our birth certificates.\" That was Ignacio Piña. Professor Balderrama, you knew Ignacio Piña. Can you tell us more about this story and how typical it was?\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Well, Mr. Piña called me after we had the hearings in Sacramento. We conducted extensive interviews. And getting to meet his family, his son shared with me that he no longer has the nightmares, that this man was experiencing well into his eighties, because he was able to share his story with us. Mr. Piña, who's recently deceased, became an activist in regards of the Apology Act and the erection of the memorial here in Los Angeles. And I think it shows that an individual that suffered with this throughout his life, that even had nightmares as a senior citizen about that, became an activist and shared that story multiple times, to the press, to the television, on and on, with a conviction that, as many of the other survivors, that this not happen to anybody else. When he said that, and the other survivors, not to happen to anybody else, he just doesn't mean people of Mexican descent or Latino descent. Rather, what he's saying is anybody else, and especially those that are American citizens. It shouldn't happen. We should not have unconstitutional deportation.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Balderrama, you've specialized in the mass deportations of the 1930s. But that was not the last of these deportations, right? In the 1950s, there was Operation Wetback under the Eisenhower administration. Then, of course, during the Bush years and into the Obama years, there were the mass deportations that occurred. It seems every time there is an economic crisis in the United States, the first reflex is to start mass deportations of \"the other,\" as this society begins to declare them.\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Exactly, Juan. You're right on target with that, that we do have these cycles. What behooves American society to understand is that this early period that I have studied, the early 20th century and the Great Depression, which is the most severe economic crisis of the 20th and the 21st century, is the fact that at that time developed this ideology, this set of beliefs, this way of thinking of the Mexican, Latino population, that somehow they are not part of our society, that they are-that many of them are criminals, many of them are here to be on welfare, that somehow, someway, they cannot become part of our society. And I think what is especially important to keep in mind for your listeners is that as we experience the nightmare of today, the crisis of today, which is different, that same ideology, that same way of thinking, is still in action today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go, Professor Balderrama, to your late co-author, Raymond Rodríguez. This is Rodríguez speaking at the 2003 Select Committee on Citizen Participation at the California state Senate.\n\nRAYMOND RODRÍGUEZ: My dad left in 1936, when I was 10. I never saw my dad again. How is anybody going to compensate me for that loss?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Raymond Rodríguez, your co-author. Can you tell us about him and his family's experience? And also, why just Mexicans? Was it only Mexicans?\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Well-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Because 60 percent of them perhaps were American.\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Raymond Rodríguez was my-was my-not only my colleague. Raymond Rodríguez was a very, very dear friend. We spoke with one voice when we wrote Decade of Betrayal . And in countless venues, we spoke with one voice in terms of this particular issue. I had known Ray for some 20 years at the time that we completed the first edition of Decade of Betrayal . And at that moment, I learned that his father had been a repatriot, at that moment when the book was finished and we were submitting it to the publisher. I knew that he had grown up with a single parent, with a mother only, but I didn't know what had happened to his father. So, in a lot of ways, my co-author, my treasured friend, his work, together, his scholarship, as well as his activism, was trying to uncover that history, his own family history.\n\nAnd we see that thread among others, as well, many other individuals who, in understanding this issue from reading Decade of Betrayal , from hearing your radio program, from looking at this and understanding this, have developed a larger understanding. What we have seen happen is that this private history has now become a public history. And many people, as they deal with this, trying to become a public history, that even though Ray, in-the excerpt that you just played was the very first time that publicly he announced that his father had been a repatriot, that what had happened had divided his family. His mother and his siblings stayed here in the United States, and his father returned to Mexico, and he never saw his father again.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Balderrama, this whole issue of repatriation, the United States government labeled it \"repatriation\" because it claimed that the people were voluntarily agreeing to go back to their home country. But as you know, as you've reported, and as happens right here in the United States now, people are picked up, locked up and then told, \"If you don't want to stay locked up, then you agree to be-to self-deport, to, in essence, leave the country and go back to your home country.\" So it's really a choice of staying in jail or having a chance possibly to come back legally at some other time.\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Juan, you're right about that. But looking at it in the context of the 1930s is that \"repatriation\" was a cover-up word, because at that time, which marks the '30s different than today, is that the big source of this expulsion is on the local level. It's in the cities and counties that took upon themselves to say to their communities, \"There is enough jobs for real Americans, if we can get rid of these other people.\" So, L.A. County and other counties throughout the nation then pressured Mexican families to leave, even though Mexicans, from my research, never were a large percentage of those that were on welfare. But it played to the notion or the idea that Mexicans were on welfare. Here in L.A. County, they began to call their actions \"deportation.\" And the legal counsel says, \"No, you can't do that. Only the federal government can do that.\" And that's where the word \"repatriation\" is born, so to speak, to be used in that context to cover it up, to make it look clean, make it look like it's voluntary. But at the same time, you have public raids. At the same time, you have the press talking about unwanted Mexican Americans. All of these actions are very coercive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Professor Balderrama, your response to what's happening today, and the parallels that you see and the ways you can see avoiding history repeating itself?\n\nFRANCISCO BALDERRAMA : Well, obviously, this is a nightmare. Obviously, the legacy of this is in the Mexican community. Even before this happened, I know many senior citizens who would carry around their papers, their documentation, whatever they had, in fear that they might get caught up in a sweep. Now, obviously, those same feelings are being reported daily in the press about people staying home, people even fearful to go out and buy groceries. So that has returned.\n\nBut what I think marks the difference between the past and today is, the simple fact is that we have in the Mexican community different groups-the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund and Education Fund, MALDEF , other groups-and, more importantly, the different across ethnic, progressive groups together, whether they be Japanese-American, whether they be Jewish American, the various other groups who have come together and are very conscious of what is happening and are dedicated to those actions of activism to stop this, what's occurring.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Francisco Balderrama, we want to thank you so much for being with us, professor of American history and Chicano studies at California State University, Los Angeles, co-author of Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s . We'll link to that book , as well as yours , Juan, Harvest of Empire , the whole story that-in which you include this, as well.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

The Mexican poet and novelist Javier Sicilia called for the demonstrations after his son, Juan Sicilia, was murdered along with six others in the city of Cuernavaca last month. A demonstrator said Javier Sicilia's call had inspired Mexicans to speak out.\n\nProtester : \"This civil expression is for everything that we have been suffering in Mexico, this upheaval that is not ending and needs to stop. Unfortunately, the violence in Mexico is something disproportionate. It is something that shouldn't be happening. It is enough, enough for us, the citizens. We are fed up with this truly not having any end. The incident in Cuernavaca, I believe, has been the wildfire that unfortunately has us saying, 'Enough already.'\"\n\nThe demonstrations came as dozens of bodies were discovered near Mexico's border with the United States. Mexican prosecutors say 59 bodies were found in a series of graves in the state of Tamaulipas. More than 37,000 people have died since President Felipe Calderón declared a war on drug traffickers in 2006."

      "text": "Seven Myths about Mexican-Americans\n\nWriter & Consultant\n\nWe've all heard them, and we're hearing them a lot more these days\n\nOriginally published in MediaLife Magazine on May 26, 2016.\n\nThis article is part of an ongoing Media Life series entitled \"Catching the next big wave: Hispanic media.\" You can read previous stories by clicking here .\n\n\"I don't want those people in my store,\" a Houston furniture retailer told me in the early 1990s after I pitched him ad time on Univision's local station.\n\nAs far as he was concerned, Latinos were all lazy, poor and a drain on the economy. They had nothing to offer his business, or this country.\n\nOf course, he was wrong, as the increase in U.S. Hispanic purchasing power has proven, going from $212 billion in 1990 to $1.5 trillion in 2015.\n\nFor the past 30 years, Americans of Mexican descent have given a big boost to the US economy, never mind their contributions to American culture from popular music to cuisine.\n\nUnfortunately, fears stoked by candidates in the presidential campaign have breathed new life into old stereotypes about Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants.\n\nIt's time they were debunked once and for all.\n\n***\n\n1. Mexicans are surging across the border. (False.)\n\nNet migration of Mexicans is at its lowest since the 1940s . In 2015, the apprehension of migrants from Mexico was the smallest in nearly 50 years, according to Pew Research Center. Since the end of the Great Recession of 2008-9, 140,000 more Mexicans returned home than crossed the border.\n\n***\n\n2. Mexicans are lazy. (False.)\n\nIn a study of 36 of the world's industrialized nations , Mexico took the top spot for the longest work week, with an average of 42.85 hours. The U.S. came in at No. 16 at 34.4 hours.\n\n***\n\n3. Mexican immigrants are mostly rapists and other violent criminals. (False.)\n\nThe jail rates for young, less-educated men living in the U.S. but born in Mexico is 2.8 percent. That's one-third the percentage for U.S.-born young men without a high school diploma, who have a rate of 10.7 percent, according to 2010 Census data.\n\nThe same pattern shows up in the 1980, 1990 and 2000 Census. Not only are immigrants less likely to end up in prison, a 2014 study shows they're less likely to engage in violent or anti-social behavior than U.S.-born Americans.\n\n***\n\n4. Mexico is poor. (False.)\n\nWith a $1.3 trillion economy, Mexico ranks as the 15th largest market in the world. If you adjust for purchasing power parity, the country ranks No. 11 , behind France and ahead of Italy.\n\n***\n\n5. Mexican immigrants bring diseases like Ebola and dengue fever. (False.)\n\nPulitzer-prize winning site Politifact gave its \"Pants on Fire\" rating to a Georgia congressman's claim that immigrants arriving from Mexico were bringing Ebola into the U.S. \"There is no outbreak or bump in disease attributable to immigrants ,\" says Arthur Caplan of New York University's Langone Medical Center in an NBC report.\n\n***\n\n6. Most Mexican-Americans are undocumented. (False.)\n\nSeventy-six percent of all U.S. Hispanics of Mexican origin are U.S. citizens. Two-thirds were born in the U.S. In fact, by some estimates 89 percent of all U.S. Hispanics are either citizens or legal residents.\n\n***\n\n7. Undocumented immigrants are a drain on the U.S. economy. (False.)\n\nWorkers without legal authorization pay far more in taxes than they are eligible to receive in benefits. According to Stephen Gross , chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, people working in the country without papers have paid $100 billion into Social Security over the last decade, even though they are not eligible to receive benefits themselves.\n\nUndocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps or Medicaid. Even legal immigrants cannot receive those benefits until they have been in the U.S. for more than five years.\n\n***\n\nWith the furniture store owner, I started sending him statistics and newspapers articles in order to change his mind. My effort to use sound reasoning to overcome stereotypes paid off when as a test he bought a small advertising schedule.\n\nThe results came back an unqualified success, so he invested more. Eventually, he thanked me for helping his business grow.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Mexicans Searching For Missing Relatives Find Bones, Shoes At Possible Mass Killing Site\n\nTEUCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) - When a group of citizens searching for missing relatives in the western state of Jalisco arrived at a remote ranch outside Mexico's second-largest city last week on an anonymous tip, all they had to do was push open the unlocked gate.\n\nInside they went to work with simple tools - picks, shovels and metal bars - doing the work that state investigators supposedly had done six months earlier.\n\nWhat they found embarrassed state authorities and shook Mexico: dozens of shoes, heaps of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments. Distraught families from across the country have already started reaching out about clothing items they say they recognize.\n\nIt was a shocking reminder of Mexico's more than 120,000 disappeared and enough to push the federal government to take over the troubled investigation.\n\nThe ranch in Teuchitlan, about 37 miles (60 kilometers) west of Guadalajara was allegedly being used as a training base for cartel recruits when National Guard troops found it last September.\n\nAuthorities then said 10 people were arrested, two hostages were freed and a body was found wrapped in plastic. The state prosecutor's office went in with a backhoe, dogs and devices to find inconsistencies in the ground.\n\nBut then the investigation went quiet until members of the Jalisco Search Warriors, one of dozens of search collectives that dot Mexico , visited the site last week on a tip.\n\nThey found the shoes, as well as heaps of other clothing and what appeared to be burned bone fragments.\n\nMembers of the search collective were back at the site Thursday, invited to observe authorities as they worked to register evidence and search the property.\n\n\"A lot of families have stepped forward to identify items of clothing,\" said Maribel, a member of the search collective, who spoke to the press outside the ranch and asked to only be identified by her first name for safety .\n\n\"What we want is to stop all of this, the disappearances,\" she said. \"We hope that this time they'll do the work as they should.\"\n\nThere are more than 120,000 disappeared people in Mexico, according to the government's tally. Search collectives like the Jalisco Search Warriors have had to organize to do the work that authorities often will not do. They search for sites like the one in Teuchitlan, sometimes with government protection, but more often without, then make their discoveries known to pressure authorities into doing their jobs.\n\nThis time it worked.\n\nJalisco State Prosecutor Salvador González de los Santos visited the ranch personally Tuesday. He said that investigators had found six groups of bones, but it was unclear how many victims they could belong to. He did not provide details on why investigators had previously failed to find what the untrained private citizens did, but said the previous efforts \"were insufficient.\"\n\nHis office posted photos of all of the evidence located hoping that relatives might identify an item of clothing.\n\nJalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus announced Wednesday that the federal Attorney General's Office would take over the investigation as requested by Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum . The Jalisco New Generation cartel is the dominant criminal organization in the state.\n\nOn Thursday, white government vehicles ringed the isolated ranch of squat buildings enclosed by a tall wall and fields.\n\n\"This ranch served as a training site and even though it sounds awful, really harsh, for extermination,\" said collective leader Indira Navarro, earlier this week.\n\nShe blamed the state's previous Gov. Enrique Alfaro for \"trying to hide this kind of situation or discovery.\" And she asked aloud how state investigators with technology and training could have failed to find what her group did \"with pick, shovel and metal bar.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Mexican Episcopal Conference said in a statement that it was troubled by the discovery of the site, which points to an \"irresponsible omission\" on the part of authorities at all three levels of government and another sign of the larger problem of Mexico's disappeared.\n\n____\n\nSánchez reported from Mexico City.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP's coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Since then, not only he has he become the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party , he's done so while repeating his false claims and doubling down on coded racism by calling into question a federal judge's ability to do his job simply because of his Mexican heritage.\n\nFor Mexicans and other Hispanics in the United States and abroad, the U.S. might not seem like a particularly hospitable place right now. Trump's rhetoric cannot easily be dismissed anymore.

      "text": "Why Mexico Is So Comfortable With Death\n\nAdjunct Philosophy Professor, Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey\n\nMEXICO CITY -- As I read a recent article about the efforts of numerous families in Guerrero to locate the remains of their missing relatives, I tried to imagine what it would be like to stumble upon a patch of turned soil in the mountains of Iguala, fearing that very spot could hold a bit of a loved one. That image brought me heartache but not surprise. As a Latin American, I am saddened by the fact that this is an all too familiar story in this part of the world -- one only needs to remember the struggles of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo to find the \"desaparecidos\" during Argentina's military dictatorship. As a Mexican, it pains me to realize that people going missing has become so much a part of our social everyday reality that it no longer arouses our public indignation; only indifference and apathy. As a philosopher, I am pressed to place these tragedies and, more importantly, our reactions to them within the larger Mexican perspective on life and death, as I strive to understand the sense of responsibility that compels human beings to bury the dead, and in this particular case, to find them, so they can be buried.\n\nAs I struggle to answer the last question, I am drawn to the work of Robert Pogue Harrison, a professor of literature at Stanford University. Harrison explores our varied relations to the dead in his book titled \"The Dominion of the Dead.\" Reflecting on the meaning of burying the deceased, Harrison observes that burial is much more than a ritual to attain closure and separate the living from the dead. Burying the deceased is about \"humanizing the ground in which [we] build [our] worlds and found [our] histories.\" It is a way of preserving the past, of spatializing memory and claiming a place on Earth where memory can dwell and from which we can retrieve that memory in order to make sense of our present and project our future.\n\nThis explains why Harrison asserts that human societies are essentially necrocratic: \"We inherit [the dead's] obsessions; assume their burdens; carry on their causes; promote their mentalities, ideologies, and very often their superstitions; and often we die trying to vindicate their humiliations.\" As Harrison suggests, an ethical relationship arises in the sense that the dead impose upon us the responsibility to carry on and finish what they couldn't in their lifetime. And if we take that responsibility seriously, a sense of solemnity should then accompany our taking on that enormous charge entrusted from the grave, for solemnity is the only way to respond to the seriousness inherent in burying the departed.\n\nYet solemn is the last word I'd use to characterize Mexicans' relationship to the dead and death in general. Death seems to elicit a rich range of emotional responses in us Mexicans, yet one that does not contain that sense of gravitas required by the act of burying. Philosopher Emilio Uranga once said that to be Mexican is to suffer from a peculiar kind of madness, a state of being characterized by a violent oscillation between optimism and pessimism. To be Mexican is, more specifically, to sway back and forth between \"episodes of intense elation and joy and bouts of melancholy and desperation.\" Our kind of madness is nowhere more evident than in our attitudes towards death, and our relationship to death finds no greater example than in our holiday dedicated to the dead.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the Day of the Dead, with its vibrant display of light and color, is one of countless manifestations of the Mexican spirit of \"fiesta.\" The most recent iteration of this perception is found in the latest Bond film, Spectre , the opening scene of which shows the capital overtaken by a parade of dancing skeletons, wearing top hats, fancy dresses and jewelry, as well as traditional clothing, the sight of which is more reminiscent of February in Rio than of October in the Distrito Federal. On the Day of the Dead, nonetheless, spaces are indeed enveloped in bright pinks, blues, purples, oranges and yellows, suggesting a festive air. Cempasúchil flowers, known as marigolds in the U.S., whose brightness evoke the sun, are placed everywhere to guide the souls of the living and the dead. Graves are sumptuously decorated and special dishes are prepared for the occasion. We drink to honor the deceased and we tell humorous and endearing stories about them. For an outsider, the Day of the Dead might seem like another traditional Mexican festival, one in a multitude of joyful celebrations, but to the more discerning eye, this particular festivity is deeply revealing of who we are as a people.\n\nAnyone who has ever encountered the work of Octavio Paz is likely amazed by his uncanny ability for discernment, especially when it comes to our ever elusive \"Mexicanness.\" Underneath the spectacle of light and color, Paz, an authority in matters of our national character, sees the utter indifference Mexicans hold towards death. In his best known work, \"The Labyrinth of Solitude,\" Paz situates the Day of the Dead within a cultural condition of the West, namely, the overarching loss of meaning regarding death. For the Pre-Hispanic and Catholic societies that preceded us, he observes, death had a place within the grand scheme of things -- it was either a transitory stage from earthly to heavenly life, or a necessary step in a cosmic cycle of renewal. In modernity, nevertheless, death is \"infertile,\" self-contained, inconsequential; our modern conception of death does not point to anything beyond it. There is a certain silence and inconspicuousness about death -- we attempt to suppress its importance by refusing to talk about it, deeming death a taboo topic; we hide it from public view, relegating its occurrence to clinical spaces like hospitals and hospices, almost as if death were nothing but a medical phenomenon, a biological fact, \"a fact among other facts,\" to paraphrase Paz.\n\nMexicans are no different in this respect -- our only distinction lies in our strategies by which we attempt to reduce its significance. We dress and disguise her; we joke about her as we would joke about a dear friend; we write poems and songs in her name, as lovers do for their loved ones; we call her endearing names like \"la pelona,\" \"la flaca,\" \"la parca,\" \"la huesuda\"; we represent her in ways that render her non-threatening and even laughable. In an imaginary act of revenge, we consume her in skulls made of sugar, chocolate and amaranth, for if death will ultimately consume us all, why shouldn't we also consume her, if only for a brief moment? In short, we humanize her, we project our deepest frailties onto her, even when we know that death is hostile to all things human. It's our way of turning the gaping mouth looming over our heads into a figure that induces laughter instead of horror, yet we do so always with the tragic awareness that sooner or later, she will come for us all.\n\nAs much as the Day of the Dead is a celebration of death as such, it is also a time to bring the deceased back from their graves. Commemorating the dead is much more than a mental exercise of recalling the non-living to memory; it is also a summoning, a call back to life so that the dead can, for a brief moment, \"convivir\" with us, to partake in the present with the living. On the first and second day of November, many people march in processions to the cemeteries (unlike cemeteries in the U.S. where order, austerity and uniformity prevails, Mexican cemeteries are cluttered, messy and gaudy). We Mexicans often refer to the cemetery as \"panteón,\" which is quite revealing. Originally the word meant \"where the gods dwell,\" and \"panteón\" retains part of its original meaning in the sense that a panteón is a sacred place, a place where the laws that operate in the world outside are suspended. On the night of the Day of the Dead, the law that is suspended is the one that separates the living from the dead. We set up \"ofrendas\" (roughly translated as \"offerings) and share the table with them, letting the deceased have the first bite. Some even stay the night, sleeping right next to the graves of their loved ones. And for one night, the living and the dead share a sleeping bed.\n\nAll of our heavy maneuvering is ultimately only a way to distance ourselves from death because, like Paz rightly notes , we never surrender ourselves to her. On the contrary, the farther away we keep her from us, the easier it is to keep living with indifference to life and death, for they are two sides to the same coin, two faces of one reality. Death and the dead are unimportant because so are life and the living. And as much as we want to share a moment with the dead, we also want to be indifferent to their pleas and demands for the rest of the year.\n\nThis explains why we have failed not only in reclaiming the remains of the dead but also in burying them. So far it is a responsibility felt only by their families, not by the authorities and not by their fellow citizens. The fact that we have failed to perceive this as a shared responsibility is the product of the strong social division that afflicts Mexican society, like many Mexican intellectuals have already pointed out. It is a fragmentation so deeply entrenched along class, gender and racial lines that it is as if we lived in distinct worlds, even when we share the same physical space. To borrow Ernesto Sabato's metaphor , it is as if we lived in tunnels that never seem to intersect, isolated from each other's reality. Most of us fall into the trap of believing that nothing has happened in Mexico because nothing has happened to \"us.\" Yet nothing could be further from the truth, for our blindness to the realities experienced by other Mexicans is only the product of a failure to see how our stories are intertwined.\n\nThere is no greater proof of that blindness than the very simple fact of how little progress we have made with respect to the tragedies that have taken place in Mexico in recent times. Four months after the multi-homicides in Narvarte that took the lives of photojournalist Rubén Espinosa and activist Nadia Vera, and three other women (who are, sadly, often treated by media as an afterthought), more than one year after the disappearance and subsequent killing of 43 students from Ayotzinapa, and even longer after the femicides in Ciudad Juárez , which have been happening since the early '90s, and countless others affected by the violence, we have yet to find justice for those who, against their will, were brutally delivered to their deaths.\n\nMaybe the reason why we Mexicans find ourselves so comfortable among the dead is precisely because as a nation we hold nothing dear, not even life.\n\nEarlier on WorldPost:"

      "text": "Mexico Gently Reminds Us That 'Black' And 'Hispanic' Are Not Mutually Exclusive\n\nEducator, YA Novelist\n\nYes, an individual can be both black and Latino. I repeat: one can be black and Latino at the same time. Like, the same person. At every opportunity, I try to proselytize others to understand this truth but I often get looks like I'd said you could both boil water and freeze simultaneously. As if blackness and latinidad were on opposite ends of some ethnic spectrum, like how some perceive being either straight or gay. For years, I've struggled to convey the idea that one can be both but recent news renews my hope of a change in the wind.\n\nFirst Mexico legalizes same-sex marriage , and, in the same year, they recognize black Mexicans . Never in my life did I imagine either of those happening. For ages, I've known there were black Mexicans. After all, Spain brought slaves to all the Americas, not just what eventually became the U.S. They didn't just vanish into thin air once slavery was abolished. I'm proud of Mexico for finally acknowledging this. Now if we could just advance further in the World Cup...\n\nAs someone who identifies as Afro-Latino, I constantly experience prejudice based on my skin color. On my first day as a Spanish teacher in Los Angeles, many of my students snickered and assumed I must be the sub.\n\nOnce I volunteered at a soup kitchen with a cook who spoke little English. After watching her struggle to explain instructions to our group, I stepped in and revealed that I actually spoke Spanish. She immediately wagged her finger and asserted that I only knew bad words. I let her struggle on.\n\nAt times, I find myself at parties among other Spanish-speakers. Naturally, everyone will speak Spanish but speak to me in English, even though I respond in Spanish. Sometimes I want to shout, \"would I really stay here for three hours if I didn't understand what everybody was saying?\"\n\nOf course, none of these examples are malicious. They just come from a place of ignorance. There are several large communities of Afro-Peruvians, Afro-Colombians, Afro-Panamanians and other Afro-(insert name of Latin American country here). How are you supposed to know if no one puts it out there? As long as society doesn't acknowledge us, we will continue to be invisible. Here's hoping more and more Latin American countries will acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of its people.\n\nIt upsets me greatly when I see dark-skinned Latinos claim solely indigenous heritage or argue that they are just deeply tanned. Really? And don't get me started on the hair. You can see scores of black Latinas scurry to the beauty salon to \"fix\" their nappy hair, while up north, there's a growing movement of African-Americans who are proud of their natural hair. I firmly believe that internationally recognizing Afro-Latinos, the way Mexico has done, will help instill a sense of pride in those communities. It will remind us all that the Hispanic community encompasses a rainbow of colors, not one archetype. I've seen blonde haired, blue eyed Latinos as well as dark-skinned Latinos with afros bigger than basketballs.

      "text": "Mexicans Love to Hate Americans -- I Only Hate Republicans\n\nFreelance Writer, Creative Consultant\n\nIt is true that we Mexicans have a couple (or more) bad habits that can't seem to wear out, one of them being the weird love/hate relationship with Latin American dictatorial presidents. Mexican leftists 'love to love' Fidel Castro even if more than 50 years have gone by after his \"revolution.\" (They also tried loving Chavez but he made it impossible).\n\nIn my opinion this weird fanaticism goes back to the fact that Mexicans love to say that \"they hate Americans\" ever since Santana lost that huge chunk of our land. So any president that manages to make his US hatred -- part of his flag -- is quite admired down in Mexico.\n\nHowever, such anti-gringo sentiment is very well disguised because you will find many of those Mexicans boarding planes flying to the other side of the border and spending their pesos-turned-into-dollars in various American items like GAP sweatshirts and Abercrombie and Fitch t-shirts. You will also find them standing in long lines at Disneyland and buying outrageously expensive princess costumes on their way out.\n\nBut it is during sobremesa conversations when it's very common to hear phrases like \"pinches gringos, capitalists, oh how much I hate them.\"\n\nAnd me? I'm the Mexican that takes offense when it happens. Not because I believe gringos are the best, but because I have been living in the US for the past 16 years of my life and I have an enormous respect for a country that has given me opportunities and has allowed me to have choices.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean that you won't ever find me criticizing North Americans (especially NYC moms) but I refuse to make generalizations across the board being that I also have many North American friends whom I love and respect.\n\nEvery time I come to Mexico to visit my friends and family I fully embrace my country of origin, But when people ask me, \"How are things in the US? How's the economy? How's life up there?\" -- and before allowing me to answer they follow their questions with, \"That Obama has done a lousy job\" -- I simply just snap.\n\nThe other day someone dared to say, \"Romney is winning this election for sure\" which really infuriated me.\n\nI guess part of it is because I have a deep fear that it could happen. If there's one thing I truly dislike about the United States it is the Republicans and I also consider myself one of the biggest Obama fans (even though I still can't vote). Now, that doesn't mean I find the President to be perfect, I know he has had his share of mistakes -- but Romney? -- You got to be kidding me.\n\nAnd having Mexicans rooting for him is preposterous.\n\nFirst and foremost the Republican candidate has a big problem with women and Latinos, so I take personal offense -- since I fall after all --in both categories.\n\nBut when my Mexican leftist friend stated that Romney was going to win the election and thus help the country's economy, I couldn't help but wonder if he had actually (and secretly) voted for Peña Nieto.\n\nHe went on to say that Romney knows more about economy than Obama since he has proven to be a successful businessman.\n\nI said to him, \"Please tell me you don't believe that is enough reason to vote for him and if you do, I have a couple of questions for you: Is Romney's experience doing business really a factor to consider? Most probably he'll use such \"experience\" to help his rich friends but do we really believe he will actually do something to impact the life of others? The rest of the common people?\"\n\nI seriously doubt it. The Republicans have made it clear that they don't care how lowering taxation may adversely impact the lives of the poor.\n\nSo if the US election is mainly about how either candidate can improve the economy, then people should really ask themselves \"Who's economy are we talking about?\"\n\nPaul Auster, whom I strongly admire, did a pretty good job of describing the Republicans during the interview he just gave to Salon ,\n\nI think of the right-wing Republicans as jihadists; they're as crazy as those people. They want to destroy the country that we want to save. And you know they're not doing it with machine guns and bombs, but they're doing it by electing insane people to enact insane legislation that is going to do as much damage to us as bombs would in the long run. So that's my position. I'm for Obama, I wish he were different, but I know that, under the circumstances, he can't be different. Anybody farther to the left would never have a chance of winning.\n\nThe Republican Party seems to be of a bunch of misogynistic men and delusional women like Sarah Palin, who seem to have no regard for the poor, for women, for Hispanics, for African Americans or for Muslims. They're against gays and lesbians, they're against environmentalists, they're against unions and many of them are absolutely intolerant. So why on earth would any Mexican believe that Romney it's a better choice for the country that's our closest neighbor and that I have decided to call home?\n\nBeats me.\n\nRomney's politics are a frontal war with many of the things I hold important: he is proposing deep cuts to Medicaid, he also wants to roll back the Affordable Care Act by allowing states to opt out, he wants to eliminate Planned Parenthood , he supports secular employers that deny medical treatment to which they may object to for moral reasons, he is opposed to gay marriage, he believes carbon emissions aren't harmful and he opposes regulating carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists have linked to climate change, he is pushing for the self-deportation solution and he opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants a clear example is his posture on the DREAM Act which he has publicly qualified as a \"handout\", so how on earth would we want him to govern?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "¡ASK A MEXICAN!: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Matanzas\n\nStaff writer with OC Weekly\n\nDear Mexican: I live in up-state New York (that's any part of the state north of the city, for you West Coasters), and while we have a relatively small Mexican population, we have a large number of Puerto Ricans, especially in the community I live. Here's my question: a number of times I've overheard my PR friends accuse each other of being \"lazy Mexicans\" as a good-humored insult. I'm wondering if on the West Coast, where I expect that there are more Mexicans than Puerto Ricans, if you ever accuse each other of being \"lazy Puerto Ricans?\" I've asked my PR friends this question, but they think it's crazy. I'm of Irish heritage, and I was surprised one day to find out that all of the Polish jokes I grew up with were Irish jokes in England. I'm curious if maybe it's the same thing here. Basically, I see my friends as being Latino, and they don't have a problem with that until someone calls them a Mexican. Kind of like someone saying I'm Irish, but accusing me of being Protestant when I'm Catholic.\n\nSon of Erin\n\nDear Mick: Ah, another opportunity to trot out my all-time favorite joke: Why aren't there any Puerto Ricans on Star Trek? Because they don't work in the future, either. Silly chiste, but that's the point. As brilliantly put forth by Christie Davies in his examination of ethnic humor, The Mirth of Nations, mere jokes by one ethnic group against another signifies latent hostility toward the joked-upon, but nothing serious. Ethnic insults, on the other hand, suggest a deeper-rooted hatred between the groups. In other words, Mexicans don't really care about Puerto Ricans, because we always kick their ass in boxing and aren't as colonized as boricuas, so any tweaking of them is relegated to jokes--and even then, I can't think of a single Puerto Rican joke with roots in Mexico. But Puerto Ricans throwing around slurs like \"lazy Mexicans\" show they're as American as they come, because while Mexican jokes do exist in the American humor realm, bona fide slurs--wetback, chili belly, taco bender, wab, and many, many more--are as numerous as beans in a burrito. \"The number and nature of nicknames, and particularly derogatory nicknames for particular ethnic groups in America,\" wrote Davies, \"is a reflection of the strengths of the ethnic conflicts in which they have been involved and the kinds of ill-feeling that such conflicts generate.\" Diós bless America!\n\nMy fiancé and I were debating this the other night: where did the idea of Matanzas come from? How did they start? I'm of the belief that they were to provide food for an entire village during long, hard winters and have become a reason to party outside in the middle of winter. He says he doesn't think so. He said they are probably a local thing (we're from New Mexico) and other self-respecting Mexicans would never have fiestas like this.

Your husband is largely right: matanzas, for the rest of us non-New Mexis, usually involve the slaughtering of a pig just before winter to provide the pueblo with hundreds of pounds of lard, meat, blood, and all the other bounty our tasty porcine friends provide us. Some scholars also posit that Matanzas were Hispanic rituals dating back centuries, with the pig the center of the feast: since the Moorish rulers of the Hispanos' ancestors and the Jews they always despised couldn't eat pig, the feast was a great way for Spaniards and their descendents smoke out any marranos or moriscos out of the pueblo's ranks and into the bonfire. Maybe, but the Mexican always felt matanzas (\"killings\" en inglés) were always more like the Pacific Northwest tradition of potlaches, where men would compete with each other to see who could throw the biggest feast and treat others the best. And that, my dear amiga, ain't tied to any other tradition but the eternal quien-es-más-macho ritual of hombres.\n\nAsk the Mexican at themexican@askamexican.net, be his fan on Facebook, follow him on Twitter or ask him a video question at youtube.com/askamexicano!\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Latinos Are More Than \"The Jobs Americans Don't Want To Do\"\n\nWriter, blogger and activist\n\n\"Mexican.\"\n\nThe word takes on different meanings depending on who you ask.\n\nIt is often used as a pejorative: an umbrella term applied to all Latinos or Latino immigrants living in the United States.\n\nFor Mexican-Americans, the word can be complex. Some families prefer to simply call themselves \"American\" while others embrace the word \"Mexican.\" \"Chicano,\" a derivative of the word, is used to describe people of Mexican descent born in the United States.\n\nBut for me, the word feels more like a caste.\n\nLabor has always been inextricable from my understanding of Mexican identity. Even at an early age, as a mixed kid who was just becoming aware of the world, I remember wishing I could have been born as something different or as completely white because I disliked the association of \"Mexican\" with, for example, Home Depot.\n\nI also quickly got tired of \"mow my lawn.\"\n\nAll these sentiments were expressed as jokes, but they spoke to a widely accepted reality: Mexicans are here to do the dirty jobs.\n\nThey are the construction workers and the nannies, the gardeners and the janitors, the fruit pickers. They don't mind doing these jobs, and they will do them on the cheap because they are just grateful to be here in America.\n\nIt's a narrative that must be challenged.\n\nNot because we are ashamed of the Latinos whose realities reflect this, Latinos who find themselves in situations where they are exploited or must take low-paying jobs to survive, but because this narrative is one of dehumanization that affects every Latino living in the United States regardless of citizenship status.\n\nFor immigrants, the popular notion that Latinos are coming to the United States seeking better economic conditions or, more callously, \"to steal American jobs,\" contributes to the erasure of refugee status to Latinos fleeing violence or political unrest.\n\nIt's a notion born of American exceptionalism and ignorant of the fact that, in some Latin American nations, the United States directly contributed to the destabilization of regimes. Honduras , where many must flee violence, is a prominent example. No wonder the United Nations has called on the U.S. to recognize these immigrants and their children as refugees.\n\nAlso consider that private prisons continue to make money from detaining immigrants with immigrant detention quotas. Only when you apply the term \"refugee\" to those detained does this practice come into focus as truly unconscionable. That's the power of the word - it humanizes.\n\nFor Latinos with citizenship in the United States, the concept of \"Mexican\" or \"Latino\" as an identity occupying the bottom rung of an American caste system has real ramifications for how much money we earn and what jobs we are hired to do. Studies show we are paid less in both skilled and unskilled jobs.\n\nThe narrative is so entrenched in American culture that both liberals and conservatives make use of it.\n\nA prominent example would be Kelly Osbourne defending Latinos against Donald Trump on The View by saying if Latinos all left the country, Trump would have no one to clean his toilet.\n\nAnother example would be Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich saying he supports Latinos by tipping the maid at the hotel.\n\nThis all serves to treat an incredibly diverse Latino community as monolithic. At best, it reduces human beings, many of whom are refugees, down to their worth as laborers and at worst makes them out to be parasites.\n\nAnd we are not parasites.\n\nThere are many words we Latinos use to describe ourselves. American culture, however, seems to have decided on the word \"Mexican\" to describe most of us.\n\nIt's a word that takes on different meanings depending on who you ask.\n\nTo me, it describes a reality in America that affects Latinos of all stripes.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Mexico Finally Recognized Its Black Citizens, But That's Just The Beginning\n\nAssociate Editor, What's Working, The Huffington Post\n\nLast month, for the first time ever, the Mexican government recognized its 1.38 million citizens of African descent in a national survey . The survey served as a preliminary count before the 2020 national census, where \"black\" will debut as an official category.\n\nA major force behind the government's recognition was México Negro , an activist group founded in 1997 by Sergio Peñaloza Pérez, a school teacher of African descent. México Negro works for, among other initiatives, the constitutional recognition of Afro-Mexicans and to increase the visibility of Afro-Mexican culture.\n\nThe Huffington Post recently caught up with Peñaloza to discuss his organization, why recognition matters and what's next for black Mexicans.\n\n\"We have been working for twenty years without much government response, so the events of the past year have been huge progress for us,\" Peñaloza told The Huffington Post on the phone from his home in Cuajinicuilapa, Guerrero.\n\nCuajinicuilapa is one of the major pueblos negros , or black towns, of Mexico. It's also at the center of the \"Costa Chica,\" the southwestern states of Guerrero and Oaxaca where the Afro-Mexican population is concentrated (the nation's capital has a smaller black population than you'd think ). So, from a distance, México Negro campaigned for recognition by INEGI, the census agency that did the initial count of Afro-Mexicans, and CONAPRED, the National Council for Preventing Discrimination.\n\nPeñaloza told HuffPost that CONAPRED's actions are overdue, especially given the UN's announcement to focus on the rights people of African descent . \"But committed officials in both agencies have bypassed institutional sensitivity to support that Afro-Mexican national movement,\" he said.\n\nBrisa Solis, CONAPRED's communications director, said its main goal in 2016 is to translate the results of the INEGI census survey into better race-related public policies. In November, INEGI sought representatives from black and indigenous communities to help inform their policy decisions, and acknowledged that \"racial discrimination persists in our country against blacks.\"\n\nUntil last month, Mexico was one of only two Latin-American countries (the other is Chile) to not officially count its black population. As a result, the move to recognize Afro-Mexicans has been met with some pushback from Mexicans who believe that mestizo identity (the mix between indigenous people and Europeans) is more important than specific ethnicities.\n\nMexico's post-revolutionary government made a conscious effort to create a national mixed-race identity that melded Hispanic, indigenous and African ethnicities. Article 2 of Mexico's 1917 Constitution recognized its \"multicultural composition,\" and today, over 60% of Mexicans identify as mestizos. So in modern Mexico, \"blackness\" is still a tenuous identity, and many use labels like \"criollo\" (creole) or \"moreno\" rather than the ones black Mexicans tend to prefer. Peñaloza, for instance, describes himself as \"afrodescendiente (of African descent), negro (black), or afromexicano (Afro-Mexican).\"\n\nPeñaloza said one of México Negro's strategies going forward is to ally the black rights movement with indigenous rights, which are generally more widely recognized. In 2013, leaders from 26 indigenous communities in Oaxaca released a statement pushing for constitutional reform that addressed the rights of both indigenous people and Afro-Mexicans; this month, they jointly criticized the local legislature for failing to act on their recommendations.\n\n\"We couldn't seriously push our socioeconomic agenda when we were not even officially recognized as a group,\" said Peñaloza, but they can set their sights higher in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, México Negro's most important outreach effort will work on having elementary and high schools include material on Africans and people of African descent in school curriculum.\n\nOn the university level, Rosa Maria Castro Salinas, the chairwoman of the Association of Women of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca, told HuffPost that her group is launching a professorship at the Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca to study Afro-Mexican women.\n\nIn addition to increased visibility in textbooks, Jaime Bernardo Ramos, a documentary filmmaker in Mexico City, told HuffPost it will be important to increase representation in film and media. Citing the handful of famous black Mexicans, like singer Johnny Laboriel and the black Cuban actor known as Zamorita , he said afrodescientes are few and far between on the national stage.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nToo often, the militant, radical history of Mexican American workers is omitted or forgotten. But from resisting racist exclusion to building CIO unions in the 1930s, Mexican American workers have been central to left-wing politics in the United States.\n\nWorkers Alliance leader Emma Tenayuca speaks to a crowd outside San Antonio City Hall, March 8, 1937. (UTSA Special Collections)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn January 29, 1911, a coalition of Mexican revolutionaries and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a US-based anti-capitalist labor union, crossed the border between California and the Mexican state of Baja California to launch what would come to be known as the Baja Insurrection. Many of the Mexicans belonged to the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which had announced its intentions of toppling Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz, transferring the ownership of factories to their workers, and returning lands to Indigenous communities. Driven from Mexico to the United States by Díaz, the PLM had found solidarity with the IWW, which similarly advocated for workers' control of production.\n\nGrowing from a small band of less than two dozen revolutionaries to hundreds of PLM members, their supporters (including Indigenous tribespeople), and IWW members, the insurrectionists seized the towns of Mexicali, Algodones, Tecate, and Tijuana, opening an early northwestern front in the Mexican Revolution. The insurrectionaries were supported by arms and funds from US radicals, including the Socialist Party - which, combined with the prospect of thousands of US-based Mexicans joining the revolution, pushed president William Taft to act.\n\nTwenty thousand US troops sealed the border, while the US Navy secured access to ports in Baja California for Díaz's forces. The insurrectionists held out for six months, but, without any means of reinforcing or resupplying themselves, ultimately quit the campaign. Some of them subsequently flocked to the banner of Francisco Madero, a centrist, US-backed opponent of Díaz, but those who had crossed the border were summarily arrested by US authorities for violating neutrality laws.\n\nWhile short-lived, the Baja Insurrection illustrates many of the characteristics that define the historic role of Mexicans in the US left: radical, transnational, and often targeted for steep government repression. Jacobin contributor Arvind Dilawar recently spoke with Justin Akers Chacón about his book on the history of transnational Mexican working-class struggle, Radicals in the Barrio , about how participants in the Mexican Revolution brought their experiences to the early US labor and civil rights movements, and the vital position that women occupied in Mexican radicalism. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nHow would you define the barrio? What role did the United States play in creating the barrio both stateside and in Mexico?\n\nBarrios, within the context of early twentieth-century US history, refer to the formation of Mexican working-class communities that developed along migration corridors and in proximity to capitalist industries, particularly agriculture, mining complexes, railroad hubs, fisheries, and factories.\n\nAlong the California coast, for instance, you have barrios dotting the roadmap of the multibillion dollar harvest corridor that stretches from the Imperial Valley [in southeastern California] to the San Joaquin Valley [part of the Central Valley]. Others took shape or expanded in proximity to fisheries and canneries (San Diego), near garment factories (Los Angeles, Dallas) and railroad hubs (South Texas, Chicago), and near the Cotton Belt in Texas (San Antonio). Historic Mexican barrios have stretched from Arizona mining towns to the Yakima Valley in Washington State, east across Colorado's hard and soft rock mining regions, near the sugar beet farm complexes spanning the Great Plains states, and into the environs of Chicago's transcontinental railyards and beyond.\n\nSome of the oldest barrios in the contemporary Southwest actually predate US conquest and colonization. For instance, San Diego was established as a Spanish Catholic missionary project through the forceful colonization and attempted conversion of the original Indigenous Kumeyaay people beginning in 1769, and Los Angeles was founded as a land-grant concession to Mexican migrants (mostly Indigenous and African-descendent people from Mexico City) by the Spanish Colonial government in 1781.\n\nIt's impossible to understand barrio formation without understanding the long and sordid history of US colonialism and imperialism in what is today the southwestern United States, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century. The US invasion of Indigenous and Mexican lands began with the uprising of slaveholders in Coahuila y Tejas in 1835 and was followed in 1846 by full-scale military invasion. This opened up a period of more than half a century of conquest and settler-colonialism across the West and Southwest.\n\nConquest then continued in the form of economic imperialism, through which US capitalists exported vast stocks of capital and consolidated control over much of the Mexican economy. This induced widespread social and economic displacement within Mexico, as the exploitation and sale of Mexico's vast natural resources were repatriated as profits for US investors. This transformation of Mexico into a resource colony of the United States pushed over a million displaced Mexican people to migrate north over the first three decades of the twentieth century alone. US economic domination and political and military meddling was entrenched by the turn of the century, and the US state played kingmaker in Mexican politics, backed by US Marines. These factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910.\n\nAfter the US invaded Mexico in 1846 and annexed its northern half in 1848 - today's Southwest - the federal and state governments treated the conquered inhabitants the same way as it did other Indigenous peoples in the path of settler-colonialism: through violent dispossession from the land, disenfranchisement from the political system, and racialized proletarianization and segregation.\n\nBarrio, which means \"neighborhood\" in Spanish, now meant something different: poverty and underdevelopment. Indigenous people were forced onto reservations and Mexicans could only live within racially restricted neighborhoods that were systematically impoverished and marginalized, excluded from civil and political participation, and brutally over-policed to keep people subjugated.\n\nHow did Mexican radicals fuse Indigenous traditions with European ideologies to arrive at their own unique politics? How did those politics differentiate Mexican radicals from their Anglo counterparts?\n\nMany radicals operating within Mexican territory in the early twentieth century were Indigenous people or had Indigenous roots, with ties and networks connecting to Indigenous communities. One cannot fully understand Mexican history - especially the deep-rooted resistance of the people and episodes of rebellion and revolution - without identifying the centrality of Indigenous people within that history.\n\nIndigenous communities resisted the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico over its four-decade span (1876-1910), especially when the government began to sell off large swathes of their communal and ancestral lands to foreign investors in the 1880s as part of its drive to build Mexican capitalism following the US model. By the early 1900s, Indigenous radicals from different groups across the country had joined (and formed a large part of the ranks of) the proto-socialist movement founded in 1901 as the Partido Liberal Mexicano, under the leadership of the Flores Magón brothers: Ricardo, Enrique, and Jesús.\n\nIn most cases, Mexican Indigenous people did not see themselves as Mexican or part of the nation, but rather victims of it. In understanding the dynamics of revolutionary movement-building in Mexico, the radical socialist left developing around the Flores Magón brothers understood and embraced this in their internationalist framework.\n\nThe Flores Magón brothers were radicalized while attending college in Mexico City, but also drew from their own cultural knowledge and experiences. Their father was an Indigenous elder in their hometown in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and they came of age learning the important tenets of collectivism, reciprocity, other forms of communal obligation, and mutual well-being. They developed their radical philosophies by reading European texts available at the time (Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, etc.), while also following news stories and instances of Indigenous rebellion happening across the nation, which were becoming more widespread in the 1890s. They refracted their vision of communism through the Indigenous courage to act and power to resist, and the real-to-life models of how it could work within their Mexican Indigenous context.\n\nUnlike their Anglo and European counterparts, most of whom embraced the tenets of American exceptionalism and ignored the plight of Indigenous populations, the magonistas made the Indigenous struggle a central component of the class struggle. They situated the importance and relevance of Indigenous liberation and struggle alongside those of the industrial and rural working classes.\n\nAside from Indigenous people forming their ranks and providing bases of support, the magonistas supported and helped organize and coordinate revolt in defense of Indigenous lands, and returned ancestral lands to the people in the few instances when their insurrections were successful during the revolutionary period. The direct participation of magonistas in support of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata and his Army of the South played an influential role in the development of the Plan de Ayala, in which the Zapatistas pledged to restore all stolen Indigenous lands over the course of the revolution.\n\nMutualistas - mutual aid organizations - served as multipurpose vehicles for the Mexican working class, approximating labor unions during times of workplace strife and civil rights advocacy groups during periods of racial persecution. Why were mutualistas at the center of radical Mexican politics?\n\nThe economy of late nineteenth-century Mexico was characterized by social underdevelopment, underwritten by imperialism. Unions were outlawed by the Mexican state to maintain low wages and a high rate of exploitation for foreign capital. Under these conditions, the working class had to develop its own means and methods of self-sufficiency, mutual support and reliance, and reciprocity to meet the basic needs that were not provided by the state or nongovernmental institutions. These included burial services, medical plans, support for destitute or disabled members, etc.\n\nIn their initial self-help form, mutualistas were tolerated by the state since they posed no threat. They could even be co-opted by the state for political patronage purposes, trading demonstrations of political loyalty in exchange for benefits and rewards. Nevertheless, the class-based infrastructure of mutualistas - collectivist practices, reciprocal obligations, family and kinship relations, and overlapping memberships within the working classes in local industries - meant that they could also become mechanisms for organizing strikes and other actions at the point of production. By the turn of the century, economic and political crisis and growing social inequality led to the formation of explicit \"labor mutualistas,\" which represented the evolution from self-help to class-conscious, working-class defense organizations.\n\nIn the United States, Mexicans brought their mutualista traditions with them and reconstituted them across the Southwest. This practice continued as a response to the racism experienced by Mexicans and the systematic neglect and social underdevelopment of the barrios. Also, with some exceptions, most US-based unions, especially the American Federation of Labor, largely ignored or excluded Mexican workers, leaving them to their own devices.\n\nThe mutualista organizations that formed across western US states in the first three decades of the twentieth century formed the class base and functional networks for the growth and spread of the radical and revolutionary Mexican left in the US in that period, especially the magonistas of the PLM, as well as the IWW. Later, the Mexican working-class rank-and-file members of these organizations were pivotal to the organization and growth of a new labor federation, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), in Mexican communities across the Southwest from the 1930s to early 1950s.\n\nWhat role did repression play in catapulting Mexican women in particular to the forefront of these movements? How did they overcome the machismo of Mexican culture and the early left more generally?\n\nIt's important to recognize that machismo has been a feature and function of labor exploitation embedded in US capitalism from its inception, and has impacted women across all cultures. Not only have women historically been paid less for the same work, but racialized labor exploitation has meant that women of color are paid even less than white women. Mexican women, alongside black women, were paid the lowest wages within the formal economy.\n\nBy the 1930s, Mexican women constituted a substantial part of the working class within the gendered divisions of labor that characterized industry and employment in the Southwest. For instance, women were the majority of workers in canning and packing, garment manufacturing, and nut-shelling, as well as in domestic service, laundry service, cigar-making, and a variety of other sectors. During World War II, Mexican women became a large contingent of the labor force in wartime industries.\n\nMexican women were at the forefront of some of the most important episodes of militant labor organizing and strike efforts. From the barrios, they emerged as mass leaders, radical theorists, and national figures within the Communist Party and the CIO. Their leadership at many junctures of the rising labor movement during the period impacted the thinking of many men, created the basis for wider discourse on gender and sex equality, and challenged the patriarchal structures of the unions and political organizations.\n\nFor example, women cannery workers negotiated the first union contracts to guarantee equal pay for all workers regardless of sex, race, or nationality, paid maternity leave, and Spanish-language rights provisions guaranteeing bilingual publication of contracts, work notifications, and all other company documentation. In fact, you can see how the concept of civil rights first emerges in the hard-fought labor struggles and union contract guarantees won at the point of production at this time.\n\nBecause of their resilience and militancy, Mexican women were brutally repressed alongside the men. There is a long history of police violence against Mexican people in the barrios, including women and children. Labor unions and worker-led civil rights organizations at the time, such as the Workers Alliance in San Antonio and the Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples in Los Angeles, organized their communities to battle strike-breaking police and to resist and oppose the racist brutality that they experienced on a daily basis.\n\nIn numerous strikes, women were at the forefront of blocking and fighting scabs and squaring up against the police. They also protested and organized against la migra (immigration authorities), as people were routinely arrested and deported during the Great Depression, with agents directly targeting strikers, union organizers, and political radicals.\n\nIn some instances, state repression of male workers led to circumstances where women carried a strike or struggle forward. From 1908 to 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, women in the PLM were leading and coordinating a transnational movement from the Southwest to the interior of Mexico, as the male leadership faced constant police harassment and incarceration. In the 1950 Empire Zinc strike in New Mexico (memorialized in the film Salt of the Earth ), the wives of striking miners took over after the corrupt local government declared the strike illegal and threatened the men with arrest if they maintained their picket lines.\n\nIn crucial junctures of US labor and radical history, Mexican working-class people have often been at the forefront - with women in the foreground.\n\nWhat forces pushed Mexican workers to the forefront of both the labor and early civil rights movements? Why has their participation in these movements been under-acknowledged?\n\nIt's important to understand the close proximity to Mexico and the particular conditions of conquest, imperialism, and migration that led to the substantial growth of a Mexican working class within and across the United States by the 1920s. Mexicans became the largest section of the working class across major industries - agriculture, mining, railroad, and, in many cases, urban manufacturing. They were systematically oppressed across the economy to the point where the lowest wage in sectors was colloquially referred to as the \"Mexican wage.\" Under these conditions, Mexican were often the first to down tools or to join others who did so.\n\nTheir tendency toward explosive resistance and instincts toward organization and collective action was also a result of many workers' participation in the Mexican Revolution. Many workers brought their experience in revolutionary armies and radical unions and revolution-era organizations with them into the farm, mining, and railroad camps. This experience, politicization, and accumulated knowledge was activated and deployed during periods of conflict and class struggle.\n\nThe proclivity of Mexican worker militancy and leadership in class struggle was recognized by farsighted socialists, anarchists, and communists. These radicals learned and understood Mexican workers as an essential component of any radical labor movement or revolutionary transformation. There were various efforts by these radicals to recognize, document, and steer their organizations or unions toward understanding, supporting, and acting in solidarity with Mexican workers.\n\nDespite episodes of convergence between radical and revolutionary organizations with upsurges in Mexican labor struggle, these have been followed by massive state repression or ruptures and decline. This includes the growth of the IWW through its merging with the PLM in the Southwest between 1909 and 1916, which was crushed by a nationwide campaign of state terror and deportation; the building of Communist Party organizations in Mexican barrios across the Southwest in the 1930s, followed by federal and state anti-communist campaigns to repress and deport Mexican Communists and labor leaders; and the inclusion of tens of thousands of Mexican workers into the CIO by the late 1940s, followed by a full-scale mobilization by the state to destroy the predominantly black and Mexican CIO unions as part of the McCarthyite campaign to drive radicals out of the CIO and union movement altogether. In each of these episodes, Mexican and Central American labor leaders and Communists were deported en masse. McCarthyism represented a convergence of organized anti-communism and Jim Crow white supremacist reaction.\n\nThe history and knowledge of these episodes of mass Mexican labor upsurges and radicalism have been erased and buried.\n\nRadical and Marxist Chicanas and Chicanos, politicized in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s, began the process of reconstructing and reconnecting to this Mexican working-class history. The mass strikes, walkouts, and marches for immigrant rights and amnesty centered on May Day 2006 awoke a new generation to the power and transformational potential of the Mexican working class in the United States, as well as Central American and Caribbean workers.\n\nJustin Akers Chacón is an activist, labor unionist, and educator living in the San Diego-Tijuana border region.

Over the roar of the rails, unfamiliar voices suddenly boomed across town plazas newly bedecked in red banners. Some of the revolutionists spoke in Welsh and Australian brogues, others in the rugged dialects of the US mountain states, others in the studious Spanish of urban Mexican literatis freshly returned from their American exiles. But more familiar accents rang out, too. Other insurrectionists, their voices somewhat muted in the historical record, spoke their minds in the local idioms of the borderlands, as well as in the maligned indigenous languages of Kiliwa, Cocopah, and Kumeyaay.\n\nWithin the insurrectionary army, firebrands from the lower tiers of Mexico's frustrated elite mingled with English-speaking syndicalists from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and both groups rubbed shoulders with dispossessed indigenous farmers who had earlier allied with the liberal revolutionary program based on its promise to subvert the power of the landed hacendado class. A diverse bunch of radicals, reformers, and libertines, the Baja insurrectionists found fellowship in one another through the strikingly capacious ideology of revolutionary Mexican liberalism. \"The only thing distinguishing them as an army,\" writes the biographer of one international volunteer, was \"the anarchist emblem, tiny red bows, pinned to their sleeves.\" But there were also straightforward adventurists and opportunists in their midst, including some loudmouthed American chauvinists and at least one likely state informant.\n\nLeading the Baja insurrection - or trying to - was the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), a formation that, from its exile in the United States, represented the leftmost pole in the wider Mexican liberal milieu. Despite the PLM's radical democratic aspirations, however, at no point did the rebellion in Baja represent a mass movement. In fact, as the insurrectionists traveled by foot and rail across the sparsely populated peninsula, they often raised their red flags over nearly empty towns, the residents having vacated their homes upon hearing their approach. Meanwhile, within the revolutionists' motley ranks, tensions quickly mounted between local insurgents and international volunteers, who were frequently elevated to leadership positions based on their (often fabricated) credentials as military adventurers.\n\nThis was surely disappointing to the insurrection's intellectual architects - most notably Ricardo Flores Magón, the PLM's most important tribune. For years, Flores Magón and his collaborators had lived in exile as political fugitives, hunted not only by agents of the Mexican dictator but also by the emergent US domestic-security apparatus. By the time of the Baja rebellion, their multinational newspaper, Regeneración , was already well established as the most radical voice in the liberal revolutionary movement. And their party, the PLM, seemed poised to be a leading force in the revolution many Mexicans felt was imminent.\n\nBut the political clarity expressed in Regeneración was not reflected in the Baja California campaign. As the anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz notes in his extraordinary, if underappreciated, 2014 book The Return of Comrade Ricardo Flores Magón , \"The ideological prominence of the Partido Liberal Mexicano was in inverse proportion to its military significance.\" In the hard light of Baja, Lomnitz elaborates, \"the edifice of their ideology appeared as a kind of holographic illusion: its elegant outlines, volumes, and perspectives had no hard substance.\"\n\nThe insurrectionary experiment in Baja did not long endure. The rebellion's final routing came in less than six months - not at the hands of President Porfirio Díaz, but from an adversary grown closer to home. More moderate elements of the national liberal coalition escorted the rebels across the US border, clearing space for the short-lived presidency of bourgeois revolutionary Francisco Madero. Lomnitz records that the Baja revolutionists \"were given ten dollars each, fed at the Chinese restaurant in Calexico, boarded on a train to El Paso, and asked to disperse from that point.\"\n\nThe Mexican Revolution was just beginning, but the PLM would never recover from this marginalization. For Flores Magón and his cohorts, Madero's suppression of the Baja rebellion constituted the first great betrayal of the Mexican revolutionary era.\n\nThe carnivalesque insurrection the PLM orchestrated in Baja tends to be remembered nowadays as a cautionary tale, a warning to voluntarists and idealists. Staged at the cusp of the storied Mexican Revolution, but not exactly of that revolution (at least in memory), the Baja rebellion has gone down in history as a kind of doomed utopian rehearsal, a well-intentioned experiment that unfortunately turned freakish under the glare of the unblinking California sun. Tellingly, Flores Magón is celebrated in Mexico today not as a participant in the country's revolution, but as a \"precursor\" to it - a strange fate to befall a man who in fact lived through the upheavals his ideas are now thought to have prefigured.\n\nTwo recent books bring a refreshingly global historical perspective to the most radical currents in the Mexican Revolution, most notably the one personified by Flores Magón. Neither attempts to rehabilitate the contradictory Baja experiment, but each, in its own way, returns the PLM and its radicalism to the core of the Mexican revolutionary process - not to mention the global epoch of anti-capitalist revolution that followed on its heels.\n\nBad Mexicans: Race, Empire, and Revolution in the Borderlands by Kelly Lytle Hernández and Arise!: Global Radicalism in the Era of the Mexican Revolution by Christina Heatherton each begin in the United States, not in Mexico - and they each begin with lynchings.\n\nHernández, a historian at UCLA, opens Bad Mexicans with a chilling description of the public murder of twenty-year-old Mexican ranch hand Antonio Rodríguez in 1910. Some four hundred Anglo-American residents of Rocksprings, Texas assembled to participate in Rodríguez's murder, helping to gather kindling and later to bind the abducted man to a mesquite tree and set it ablaze. The object of the Texas town's genocidal fury had not been randomly selected. \"He was a 'revolutionist,' whispered the residents of Rocksprings after they lynched him,\" Hernández writes. The mob had chosen to execute someone \"suspected of being one of the many magonistas known to be in the border region.\"\n\nOccurring just over the border on the American side, the lynching of Antonio Rodríguez inspired a wave of militant protests throughout Mexico. The demonstrators directed their fury at the US enterprises operating in the country, as well as at President Díaz, the dictator who had earlier opened the country to voracious US investment. Mexican outrage over the incident was so profound that even five years later, after Díaz's departure and the beginning of a whole new period in the revolutionary conflict, Flores Magón would evoke the murder's memory: \"The blood of Antonio Rodríguez has not yet dried in Rock Springs,\" he wrote in one fiery communiqué. In Hernández's telling, this atrocity was the spark that ignited the decades-long Mexican Revolution.\n\nHeatherton, a professor of American studies at Trinity College, also launches her book with a scene of racist terror in the United States. In 1871, a band of hooded Klansmen abducted three black men - \"Squire Taylor, forty-five, George Johnson, thirty-nine, and Charles Davis, sixty-eight\" - from a jail in Charlestown, Indiana. Their attack was observed by a local reporter, whose account of the atrocity appeared under the headline \"Masks and Manilla,\" a reference to the imported fiber then used to manufacture ropes. And although it took place hundreds of miles away from the border, this lynching in Indiana, like the lynching of Antonio Rodríguez in Texas, was connected by circumstance to the efflorescence of revolutionary politics in Mexico.\n\nManilla fiber had entered the international commodity market courtesy of US imperial adventures in the Philippines, but by the turn of the twentieth century it had been replaced by a resource cultivated closer to home. Beginning in the 1870s, foreign investments in Mexico were protected by Díaz; land consolidation was a dream shared by domestic and foreign investors alike, and Díaz was the political avatar of the increasingly well-networked Mexican hacendado class. By 1900, around a quarter of all arable Mexican land was in the hands of US proprietors, and thousands of Mexican workers labored in the mines and plantations of US interests, often living in company towns.\n\nOne of the defining features of Díaz's corporatism was a forced labor system that conscripted indigenous (especially Yaqui) people, as well as dispossessed peasants, in the borderlands, then forcibly relocated them to work on consolidated landholdings in southern Mexico. These flows of forced labor enriched US and Mexican investors who established plantations in southern states like Oaxaca and Yucatán, many of which cultivated henequen, a rope-making fiber derived from agave plants. By the turn of the twentieth century, henequen had supplanted Filipino manilla as the key component of American ropes.\n\nThe raw material of white supremacist terror in the United States - the actual matter from which so many hundreds of nooses were fashioned - was derived from a labor regime Flores Magón and his allies condemned as analogous to American chattel slavery. And while Heatherton doesn't make the point exactly, other historians have suggested that it was this similarity, more than anything else, that fueled the formation of an ideological current in the United States that condemned Díaz and advocated material support for the revolutionary cause.\n\nAs Lomnitz puts it, \"Mexico's heart of darkness - its slavery, its extermination of Yaqui and Maya Indians - was disturbingly familiar\" to people in the United States, \"for in it, the sins of America were revived and made current in an alien form that was easy to condemn.\" The eclectic group of American supporters that coalesced around the PLM in exile included figures like writer Jack London and the Socialist Party's Eugene Debs and Job Harriman.\n\nFor the most part, Bad Mexicans and Arise! cover different historical ground. Still, they each manage to narrate not only the rise of revolutionary activity in Mexico, but also the fitful emergence of what Heatherton calls, following W. E. B Du Bois , the \"New Imperialism\" - a world order based not only on the white-hot mobility of US capital, but also on the color line, an imaginary yet durable institution that conscripted ordinary white Americans as the shock troops of an exclusive propertied ideal that most of them would never attain.\n\nGiven this framing, it is fitting that Hernández and Heatherton are perhaps best known as scholars of policing. (Hernández's previous books are Migra! , a groundbreaking history of the US border patrol, and the award-winning City of Inmates , about the Los Angeles municipal jail system. Heatherton is the coeditor of the essay collection Policing the Planet: Why the Policing Crisis Led to Black Lives Matter , among other volumes.) Both authors' accounts of the Mexican Revolution are highly attuned to the destructive powers of the US state's repressive apparatus, whose avatars at the time included such fearsome characters as the paramilitary Texas Rangers and the mercenary detectives of the Furlong Secret Service Company.\n\nBad Mexicans draws on the voluminous records left by US and Mexican espionage agencies to narrate the long journey of Flores Magón, his brothers Jesús and Enrique, and the scores of other radicals in their orbit, from muckraking opposition journalists in Mexico City to international revolutionaries. At the center of Hernández's meticulous and exhilarating history is the author's recognition that the PLM's activities were, at every point, profoundly shaped by repression on both sides of the border - and especially at the hands of spies retained by the newfangled forces of US domestic intelligence.\n\nAs Hernández points out, the FBI was founded, at least in part, to suppress the radical momentum of Mexican revolutionaries in the borderlands. The practices through which that brutish agency would come to disrupt liberationist movements during the twentieth century were first innovated to muzzle Flores Magón, Regeneración , and the PLM.\n\nThe most exhilarating passages of Bad Mexicans describe the campaign waged by the Furlong Secret Service Agency to surveil and capture PLM members in the United States. In this effort, the mercenary detective firm collaborated with law enforcement agencies to manipulate the US Postal Service, making letters exchanged between Flores Magón and many other radicals available for their covert inspection.\n\nThis in turn led the militants to establish elaborate systems of letter handoffs to shield senders and recipients and to devise an ingenious set of ciphers for encoding their letters, examples of which are reproduced in Hernández's book. In a tragic irony common in the study of revolution, the history Hernández narrates with such verve and detail is accessible to us today only because these ephemeral communications were preserved and archived by the very state security agencies that sought to annihilate their authors.\n\nAs well as being a feat of archival storytelling, Bad Mexicans is also a story of the Mexican Revolution as viewed from the borderlands - a zone of peril and possibility that, in Hernández's account, comes to include not just the physical terrain of the US-Mexico boundary but also many other places where the exigencies of class struggle could not be contained by lines on a map. Hernández's story winds through safe houses in Los Angeles and St Louis, railway yards populated by bohemian train-hoppers, picket lines encircling US-owned mines, and many other such renegade locales.\n\nThe Baja insurrection comes near the end of Hernández's book, a kind of coda to the much longer history of courageous and patient organizing that preceded it. But the PLM experience, before and including Baja, is in many ways just the starting point of Heatherton's Arise! . Taking its title from the opening syllables of \"The International,\" Heatherton's book presents a globally panoramic view of Mexican radicalism that lasts decades beyond the close of Hernández's book with Flores Magón's death in 1922. In doing so, Arise! shows that it was in Mexico, even more than in Russia, that the forces of international capitalist development, not to mention an emergent New Imperialism shot through with white supremacy, faced their inaugural confrontation with the forces of transnational working-class resistance.\n\nHeatherton's kaleidoscopic history begins in the henequen plantations and port cities of late-nineteenth-century Mexico, hotbeds not only of capitalist agglomeration but also of budding revolutionary consciousness. But Heatherton's account extends far beyond these places, coming to include the ideological war that raged within Mexico's Soviet embassy during the ambassadorial tenure of Alexandra Kollontai; the epochal struggle of Mexican migrant laborers for welfare relief during the Great Depression; and the border-defying artistic practice of Elizabeth Catlett and her Communist collaborators, among other episodes.\n\nTo my mind, the most memorable of Heatherton's stories is her account of the \"university of radicalism\" that emerged in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary during World War I, where Flores Magón was incarcerated under the Espionage Act alongside IWW leader \"Big Bill\" Haywood and countless anonymous revolutionaries. Flores Magón died in that prison, a victim of medical neglect and coarse living conditions. And while the tale of his death has been told before - in fact, it has achieved a kind of legendary status among internationalists - Heatherton brings an entirely new dimension to this history. She recovers the forgotten story of the assassinated José Martínez, a Leavenworth prisoner dismissed by history as an apolitical \"pelado,\" but whose final assault on prison guards, Heatherton shows, may have been motivated by their cruel treatment of an ailing Flores Magón.\n\nHeatherton's narrative consistently returns to places where the churning of capitalist development throws together diverse groups of displaced and marginalized people, who together come to understand themselves as political antagonists to an emergent world system based on acute exploitation. For Heatherton, the Mexican Revolution's great significance is that it exploded from these \"convergence spaces,\" as she calls them. In so doing, it helped to generate an international repertoire of revolutionary social action through which heterogeneous groups of global rebels could identify capitalism and the color line as their common enemies.\n\nBad Mexicans and Arise! are each tremendous accomplishments of historical sensitivity and radical imagination. Taken together, and especially in combination with Lomnitz's slightly older book, they present a fundamentally new story of the Mexican Revolution, one that diverges in important respects not only from the staid nationalist-republican history of Octavio Paz , but also from the history of locally oriented (and ultimately doomed) peasant rebellions provided by Marxist revisionists like Adolfo Gilly or Roger Bartra .\n\nIt is not only their insistently transnational orientation that sets Hernández's and Heatherton's books apart. Nor is it even their unapologetic enthusiasm for the radical current embodied by the oft-misunderstood Flores Magón. It is also their hopefulness, their radical faith in the undying capacity of human beings to come together to defy the color line and overturn relations of exploitation and abuse - even, and especially, in the most disorienting of historical conditions.\n\nMore interested in recovering radical potentials than in decrying failures, Bad Mexicans and Arise! exemplify a new kind of revolutionary history, suited to a new era of struggle in the US-Mexico borderlands and beyond.\n\nJonah Walters is currently the postdoctoral scholar in the BioCritical Studies Lab at UCLA's Institute for Society and Genetics.

And in 1968, with a longtime Communist Chicano family at the center, Mexican-American students in LA launched the largest student walkout in US history.\n\nAn East LA high school student at the microphone of a school board meeting in 1968. (Los Angeles Public Library photo collection)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDuring the first week of March in 1968 , more than fifteen thousand students walked out of their high schools in Los Angeles, kicking off the largest student walkout in US history. The students, mostly Mexican Americans, were fed up with a school system that had given them de facto segregation, English-only instruction, and irrelevant curricula. The walkout, coordinated by student committees at each school, demanded more Latino faculty members, better facilities, and educational material that spoke to Mexican Americans' diverse experience.\n\nAn East LA family named the Cuaróns were at the center of the walkout. Even before the events of March '68, the Cuarón home had served as a meeting place for radicals. Mita Cuarón was a student at Garfield High School, so involved in organizing the walkout that the administration singled her out as a leader and school guards attacked her. Mita's mother, Sylvia Cuarón, was one of the first parents down on the picket line to help support and protect the striking students. And her father, Ralph Cuarón, was elected as the students' representative in subsequent negotiations with school administrators.\n\nNeither the walkout by Mexican-American students nor the Cuarón family's central role in the action were coincidences. Mexican Americans in the Southwestern United States had long organized in their neighborhoods and workplaces, buoyed by a strong tradition of radicalism. Both Sylvia and Ralph were longtime members of the Community Party USA (CPUSA), ideologically committed yet practical in their efforts on behalf of Mexican Americans, whether through labor unions or civil rights organizations. When Ralph was chosen to represent the student strikers, he understood what they were up against, saying: \"The situation did not require soft-spoken individuals to go in front of armed policemen and agitated principals, with all of the laws on their side, who were determined to punish young people one way or another.\"\n\nJacobin contributor Arvind Dilawar recently spoke with Enrique M. Buelna, author of Chicano Communists and the Struggle for Social Justice , about Mexican-American labor and community organizing in the Southwestern United States, the Communist Party's halting support for those efforts, and the iconic struggles - often involving the Cuaróns - that nevertheless unfolded. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nIn Chicano Communists , you mention that the Communist Party had some difficulty connecting with Mexican Americans in the Southwestern United States because the party failed to recognize their radical traditions, such as their organizing with the Industrial Workers of the World. What were Mexican-American workers' relationship to socialist politics prior to the CPUSA's arrival?\n\nMexican Americans and Mexican immigrants already had a long history of radical organizing in defense of their communities and working lives. These communities often formed defensive organizations (self-help organizations), forged local alliances, or joined labor unions, such as the Western Federation of Miners and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). In other examples, Mexican immigrants recreated mutualistas (mutual aid associations) from their home communities, formed extensions of the anarcho-syndicalist Partido Liberal Mexicano (Mexican Liberal Party), or joined local branches of the Socialist Party.\n\nIn other words, many of these immigrants brought with them extensive experience in modern labor militancy, but also agrarian radicalism that fused anarchist and socialist ideas with communal traditions.\n\nPart of the difficulties Mexican Americans faced within the Communist Party was being relegated to a \"national minority,\" rather than an \"oppressed nation,\" like African Americans. How were these categories distinguished, and what did they signify to the party?\n\nSome members of the CPUSA tended to mirror the same misconceptions about Mexican Americans as the broader society. Viewed largely as a transient population with no deep roots in the country, Mexican Americans were identified as new arrivals with similar historical experiences to those of German, Irish, or Italian immigrants. In other words, they had come to this country from the outside in search of a better life and better economic opportunities.\n\nAlthough this assessment was not universal across the entire organization, it clouded the view of many in the CPUSA leadership, who would come to believe that blacks and Mexican Americans were inexorably different and, therefore, necessitated distinct approaches. With African Americans viewed as an \"oppressed nation,\" this meant that their struggle would be prioritized and that they would be key in the dismantling of American imperialism.\n\nCan you elaborate on the difference between European immigrants and Mexican Americans in relation to the Southwestern United States?\n\nMexicans and Mexican Americans have had an extensive presence in the Southwest, longer than many history books and popular culture would have us believe. Since the early 1500s, indigenous peoples, mestizos, blacks, and Europeans commingled - trading, intermarrying, and warring with one another. As fraught as these relationships were, they managed to carve out new social, political, and economic spaces from which to live and coexist.\n\nFrom these roots come the origins of the Mexican-American people. By the time of the US-Mexico War of 1846-48, the region was already home to more than 100,000 people who called themselves Mexicans. With the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war, this population would become citizens of a new nation. So the presence of Mexican Americans in this country is complex and certainly not solely a story of immigration. This story is also one of conquest and colonization.\n\nChicano Communists uses longtime CPUSA member, unionist, and community organizer Ralph Cuarón as a lens through which to examine the breadth of Mexican-American socialism in the Southwest. Why were you attracted to Cuarón as your focus?\n\nEven before gathering all the details of his life's work, there was something about this family that drew you in and held you there. Later, I would come to understand why so many saw the Cuarón household as a place of refuge and, ultimately, a place to organize.\n\nEven in his eighties, Ralph had a memory for details that was just remarkable. Every interview revealed a whole set of new research possibilities that would prove to be a treasure trove, especially when I would confirm these in the archives and in other interviews. Ralph was unafraid of sharing his story, unlike others who were more hesitant, still appearing to fear the repression of the Cold War. He was unapologetic about his activism and, even in his advanced age, was defiant against a society that continued to perpetuate multiple injustices against Chicanos.\n\nWhen I discovered that his daughter, Mita Cuarón, had been instrumental in organizing and leading the school walkouts of 1968, that changed everything. His story would turn out to be key to understanding Mexican Americans' radical activism from the 1930s straight through to the Chicano Movement of the 1960s. Ralph's story helped fill an important gap in Mexican-American/Chicano history.\n\nWhat his story helps reveal is that Mexican Americans were significant participants in several major events in civil rights and working-class history in the United States. Of course, my attention was also raised to a whole new level when the FBI confirmed everything to a T.\n\nA fellow CPUSA member described Cuarón having \"an anarchist streak.\" How was Cuarón able to circumvent party bureaucracy to address the material needs of Mexican-American workers?\n\nI think that two factors played a significant role: one, his assertive and audacious personality, and two, the party's willingness to be pragmatic when it needed to be. According to Dorothy Healey, a longtime activist and leader of the CPUSA, Cuarón was recognized as a leader within the organization and among Mexican-American activists.\n\nBut Cuarón certainly challenged the party, including Healey's leadership, when he would circumvent organizational processes and procedures. From his perspective, however, he felt that the needs of the community came first, even if party stalwarts failed to see the urgency.\n\nCuarón played a role in the production of the 1954 film Salt of the Earth . How was the film connected to Mexican-American workers, and how did Cuarón aid the project?\n\nAfter suffering from the effects of anti-communism in Hollywood, a group of blacklisted directors, producers, and writers decided to make a motion picture that would circumvent the industry and break through some of the static conventions that developed after the war. They chose to focus on a fifteen-month-long miners' strike that broke out in Grant County, New Mexico, in 1951. The largely Mexican-American labor force demanded better, if not equal, pay with the company's Anglo miners, as well as decent working conditions and better housing.\n\nFrom the beginning, the lives of Mexican Americans, especially the lives of women, were placed front and center in the story. Many of the miners were members of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (Mine-Mill), Local 890, which had been very active in radical and progressive politics. Mine-Mill, in particular, had been instrumental in helping to organize the Mexican American National Association (ANMA) in 1949, a national civil rights organization whose orientation was unabashedly left of center.\n\nCuarón was a founding member of ANMA and helped lead the organization. In this capacity, he was familiar with the leadership of the striking miners and the plan to film Salt of the Earth . The blacklist offered Cuarón and many others the opportunity to take part in the production of the film as well as to work as background actors (in the case of the union president, Juan Chacón, a leading role) in the film.\n\nFinally, how did Cuarón influence the walkouts by Mexican-American students in 1968?\n\nThe Cuarón household - the house on Princeton Street in East Los Angeles - became a site for critical consciousness and organizing among a cohort of young Chicanas and Chicanos who would help lead the school walkouts of 1968. For a few years before the student strike, Cuarón became a mentor to a number of students, either friends of his daughter, Mita, or neighborhood youth who gravitated toward the home on their own.\n\nThough the youth came and went as they pleased, they remained captivated by the camaraderie, intellectual stimulation (Cuarón had reading circles that exposed them to radical publications), practical skills they learned (carpentry and construction), recreational trips, and their experience with organizing. That house on Princeton Street became a central hub of community action against the schools, local police, and elected officials who resented the assertiveness of these youth. They had become radicalized - conscious of their identity and confident of their power to effect change.\n\nEnrique M.

Before it was over, the country's agrarian oligarchy had been destroyed.\n\nA photo from the Mexican Revolution, circa 1915, featuring Pancho Villa (third from right). (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution began 110 years ago, in response to a formal invitation. It then slowly unfurled into an uncontrollable mess. Its leader, the gentlemanly Francisco Madero, issued the summons in his Plan de San Luis: \"On November 20, from 6 p.m. on, all citizens of the Republic shall take up arms to overthrow the authorities that currently govern us.\"\n\n\"Mr and Mrs Madero kindly request your distinguished presence for the initiation of the Mexican Revolution; please RSVP at your local Anti-Reelection Committee,\" it may well have read.\n\nExcept that rather than summoning a much-hoped-for, oh-so-civil civil society, Madero's call was answered by a cast of characters that has contributed to making Hollywood a more diverse kind of place: bandit heroes like Pancho Villa; a villanous coup-plotting gringo ambassador; and Francisco Madero himself, who received his marching orders at séances, from the spirit of his long-departed little brother, Raúl. And then there was also the arch-traitor, alcoholic and second Indian president of Mexico, General Victoriano Huerta, who had his boss, the mild-mannered Madero, killed; and the ancient patriarch general Porfirio Díaz, who had the folly of seeking reelection for the eigth time (when is enough enough?). The list still goes on and on . . . peasant leaders like Emiliano Zapata; wily schemers like Venustiano Carranza . . . All locked in a fight to survive, or to kill one another off - for, like Chronos, the Mexican Revolution devoured all of its children.\n\nThe Revolution put Mexico's contradictions on display, for all the world to see. It was a modern war, but unlike the First World War, with which it was contemporaneous, the Mexican Revolution's modernity sometimes let off a cheap, secondhand aroma. Its most prized gun was not the Krupp's astonishing \"Big Bertha,\" but rather the \" carabina .30-30 \" of lore. These guns were purchased from the US Army's stock of leftovers from the Spanish-American War of 1898. Still, knockoffs and all, the Mexican Revolution was a modern war, yet it served to upend the painstakingly cultivated image of modernity that had been nursed during thirty years of dictatorship (the \"Porfiriato\"). The positivist dream of Mexican evolution was shattered by crowds of sombreroed peasants, and soldadera women, wrapped in their rebozos atop the transport trains, slapping tortillas, and sleeping or fighting with the soldiers. From a symbolic point of view, the Mexican Revolution was the world's biggest jacquerie.\n\nAnd yet there were also Jacobins in the mix. The Revolution was indeed a revolution, and not a mere riot. No jacquerie lasts for decades, and no spontaneous uprising is as long in the making as Mexico's Revolution was. Indeed, long before the mild-mannered Francisco Madero issued his invitation to revolt, in 1892, a Mexico City student movement against Porfirio Díaz's fourth reelection was already teeming with young revolutionary wannabes. Reminiscing about those early days in which his politics were born, anarchist revolutionary Ricardo Flores Magón painted a scene that evokes Marx's famous comment on history repeating itself: \"The Marseillaise ,\" he recalled, \"was being sung in student boarding rooms, while on the streets and squares, you could guess from plain sight who styled himself a Marat, who a Robespierre, and who a Saint Just.\" Twenty years later, many of those erstwhile Marats joined the ranks of the revolution. Part jacquerie, part vanguardist, the Mexican Revolution churned ideology and immediacy into an avalanche that was fittingly referred to as \" la bola .\"\n\nWas the Revolution worth it, though?\n\nToo many of the people who died because of the Revolution were involuntary victims, and they cannot rightfully be called \"martyrs\" for that reason. It is impossible to calculate how many died. Demographers calculate population loss during the decade between 1910 and 1920 at over 2 million, but this includes the dead from the wars, famines and diseases, as well as the streams of refugees who fled to the United States, and the resulting decline in fertility rates. An enormous loss in a country of roughly 10 million. Not being all that much of a Jacobin myself, I find it unacceptable to justify such massive involuntary suffering with any such post hoc rationalization.\n\nAnd then there is the question of the not-so-very attractive political party that emerged out of the revolutionary process, whose very name is an example of Orwellian doublespeak: the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI), an authoritarian organization that did not do an especially brilliant job of diminishing economic inequlity.\n\nOn the other hand, thanks to widespread agrarian reform, the Mexican Revolution successfully destroyed Mexico's agrarian oligarchy, and it was the first country to nationalize its oil industry. The Revolution also destroyed the old Federal Army, and so Mexico became one of the rare Latin American countries not to have military coups in the twentieth century. These and other major accomplishments have generated hesitations regarding what history's veredict on the twentieth century's first social revolution should be.\n\nEven so, by the 1960s, many intellectuals were saying that the revolution was dead. It seemed to be dead, in any case, but then the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s brought it back to life. Privatization, democratic reform, and state shrinkage allowed the revolution to migrate from the state to the opposition, a process that culminated in 1988, with the annnointment of Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, son of Lázaro Cárdenas, and former PRI governor as its candidate for the presidency. Along with Cárdenas, Zapata, Villa, and the rest of the revolutionary pantheon migrated to one opposition or another. Thus, in 1994, an indigenous rebellion rocked the southern state of Chiapas, and it took up Zapata's name and cause. The Zapatistas also revived the symbolic topography of the revolution and made it their own.\n\nMore recently, Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Movimiento de Renovación Nacional (\"MORENA,\" which is now a political party) named its newspaper Regeneración , after Flores Magón's famous journal, while AMLO has been at pains to identify neoliberalism with the Porfiriato, and himself with Franciso Madero.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution, then, is not dead. But is it alive? That's harder to say, because it has died and been revived several times, often lingering as a ghost. Maybe this is because, despite its many sinister and farcical elements, the Mexican Revolution was, in the end, tragic - a concatenation of events that was bigger even than its heroes and villains. For this reason, it still occasionally offers models for contestation and self-fashioning, much as the French Revolution once did.\n\nClaudio Lomnitz is the Campbell Family Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It's not just because of his domestic policies: AMLO is also playing a key role in challenging US dominance in Latin America.\n\nMexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador delivers brief remarks while talking to journalists with US president Joe Biden in the Oval Office at the White House on July 12, 2022, in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador traveled to Washington, DC, on July 12, his most exciting encounter for Mexicans in both the United States and Mexico was not his meeting with President Joe Biden but his impromptu encounter with well-wishers outside his hotel room at the Lombardy. Some of them had driven from places like Chicago and New York City just to get a glimpse of their president.\n\nThe video of the encounter, which must have been a nightmare for the Secret Service protecting him, went viral. It showed the president (known by his initials AMLO) sticking his head out the window, blowing kisses, catching a bouquet of flowers thrown to him, and being serenaded by mariachis singing the song \"Amigo\" (\"You are my my soul brother, a friend that in every way and day is always with me\").\n\nAMLO showered them with praise, thanking them for their sacrifice of coming to the United States and working hard in order to send money back to their families in Mexico. \"You are heroes and heroines,\" he said, with a huge grin. \"Our economy is rising because of what you send to your relatives. You are exceptional migrants. I love you very much.\" He shared with them his plans to meet with President Biden and push for immigration reforms so that they could come and go legally. The adoring crowd below shouted back, \"We love you, president, we are with you.\"\n\nAccording to a poll released in early July, the dozens who gathered below the hotel window represent millions of Mexicans. It showed AMLO with a 66 percent approval rating, one of the highest of all world leaders. This despite the myriad problems that continue to plague the nation: inflation, corruption, violence.\n\nAMLO has plenty of detractors. Critics from the Right condemn his populist economic policies, such as the nationalization of lithium. They say he has centralized power and does not tolerate dissent. On the Left, critics say he is complicit with repressive US immigration policies, has reneged on his promises to defend indigenous rights, and hasn't done enough to stop the horrific wave of femicides and attacks on journalists.\n\nBut his fans see him as a man of the people who rode to power on December 1, 2018, with an overwhelming mandate to break with the corrupt parties that had ruled Mexico for almost a century. One of his first acts was to cut his own salary by half and slash the wages of most other top officials. He put the extravagant presidential plane up for sale, preferring to travel in economy class on commercial flights. He opened up the former presidential residence to the public, allowing millions of Mexicans and tourists to enjoy the palatial home and gardens.\n\nAnother reason for the president's popularity is the extraordinary effort he puts into communicating with the public - perhaps more than any other leader in the world. From the day he took office, he has been holding marathon press conferences from Monday to Friday, starting at 7 AM and lasting for two or three hours. Called \"La Mañanera,\" the conferences are broadcast live on public television and streamed on a dedicated YouTube channel , as well as directly on the president's official website . The president's office estimates that an astounding ten million people watch the program.\n\nUnlike scripted press events in the United States, these are free-flowing discussions where the president talks in a folksy style about everything from COVID-19, infrastructure projects, and the migrant crisis to Mexico's best foods and the cheapest places to buy gasoline. He speaks in a slow, conversational tone, breaking down political jargon into digestible concepts and taking unscripted questions from the press.\n\nClaiming that the mainstream media often misinform the public or ignore key issues, AMLO ironically uses these press conferences to bypass the media and take his message directly to the people. His open style represents a fundamental break with the past, where presidents went for years without taking an unvetted question from a reporter.\n\nBut AMLO is more than just a popular Mexican president; he has become a leading progressive figure in the Americas. He has garnered support and gratitude for bold actions he has taken in solidarity with beleaguered leftist leaders and nations. After the Organization of American States (OAS) sparked a coup against Evo Morales in 2019, AMLO sent a plane to whisk Morales out of the country and offer him asylum in Mexico. Morales credits AMLO with saving his life.\n\nHe has also offered asylum to jailed whistleblower Julian Assange and recently suggested that the Statue of Liberty should be dismantled and returned to France if Assange is extradited and imprisoned in the United States.\n\nA close friend of Cuba, AMLO sent much-needed shipments of food, medicine, and fuel to the island during the height of the pandemic and announced in May 2022 that Mexico would hire more than five hundred Cuban doctors to help make up for a shortage of medical professionals in rural Mexico.\n\nHe has railed against the US sanctions on Cuba, calling them \" depraved \" and a key reason that Cubans are migrating. He said that the people of Cuba deserve a \" dignity award \" for resisting US interference for over sixty years and that the entire country should be declared a World Heritage site.\n\nMexico hosted dialogues between the Venezuelan government and that country's opposition and resisted US pressure to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaidó as \"interim president.\"\n\nAMLO's hemispheric supporters also appreciate his recurring call for the Spanish king and the Catholic Church to apologize for the conquest of Latin America.\n\nBut AMLO's position as a regional leader was really boosted by his refusal to attend President Biden's June 2022 Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles because of the exclusion of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This had a snowball effect, prompting other heads of state to skip the gathering and turning Biden's summit into a flop .\n\nThe Summit of the Americas is closely associated with the OAS , another institution AMLO has criticized, especially for its role in the Bolivian coup . AMLO has called for replacing the OAS with a truly autonomous body - \"a lackey to no one.\" That substitute would be the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).\n\nCELAC has only existed for ten years and, unlike the OAS, it includes Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua but not the United States and Canada. Its goal is to stimulate Latin American/Caribbean independence, integration, and autonomy. Mexico's 2021 hosting of a CELAC Summit attended by almost all the leaders of the region gave the body a huge boost.\n\nAMLO and some other Latin American leaders have taken this concept of Latin American integration a step further, calling for a sort of European Union with a single currency and the right to cross borders. It harkens back to the dream of Simón Bolívar to create a unified Latin America.\n\nWhen it comes to relations with the United States, AMLO walks a fine line between railing against US policy toward Latin America and maintaining a positive relationship - even under Donald Trump. Mexico has no alternative, AMLO believes, because it shares a 2,000-mile border and there are, by Mexico's government's calculations, some 40 million Mexicans living in the United States. Even more than that, almost 80 percent of Mexican exports go to the United States.\n\nBut AMLO insists that the two-hundred-year US domination of Latin America has been exhausted and must come to an end.\n\n\"We are not a protectorate, a colony, or anyone's backyard,\" he declared in a groundbreaking July 2021 speech. \"We say 'adios' to the impositions, interference, sanctions, exclusion, and blockades.\" Instead, he called for a relationship based on nonintervention, self-determination, and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\n\nThese ideas resonate across Latin America, especially with the new left tide sweeping the continent - the election of President Gustavo Petro in Colombia being the latest and most spectacular, given the country's close alliance with the United States. If Lula wins in Brazil in the upcoming elections, the continent will be ripe for a new regional architecture and setting its own terms for its relations with the US. The continent will also be grasping for new models of development that don't rely on extractivism and corporate profits but improving the quality of life and the environment. Millions across the hemisphere will look to their new leaders, as well as AMLO and CELAC, to help navigate that process.\n\nMedea Benjamin is cofounder of CODEPINK for Peace and author of several books, including Inside Iran: The Real History and Politics of the Islamic Republic of Iran .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

MORENA's judicial reforms aim to fix this by introducing democratic elections for judges - a move that has the US and global business elites in a panic.\n\nMexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador appears with president-elect Claudia Sheumbaum on August 18, 2024, in Monterrey, Mexico. (Medios y Media / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFollowing its landslide victory in Mexico's presidential elections, the MORENA coalition is wasting no time in getting to work. Even before president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum takes office on October 1, the new Congress is taking up a package of constitutional amendments proposed by outgoing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), flexing the muscle of a two-thirds qualified majority that allows the president's party to pass such measures virtually on its own. And the first one up is already drawing the ire of corporate media and foreign powers alike: a judicial reform requiring direct, democratic elections for the entire federal judiciary.\n\nOn August 22, US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar released a statement opposing the reforms. It was, to say the least, a curious one. After mentioning Iraq and Afghanistan - two countries the United States has recently invaded and occupied - as examples of countries that lack independent judiciaries, he proceeded to aver that \"popular direct election of judges is a major risk to the functioning of Mexico's democracy.\" Following the exposition came the threat: \"I also think that the debate . . . will threaten the historic trade relationship we have built, which relies on investors' confidence in Mexico's legal framework.\" If you know what's good for you, in so many words, lay off.\n\nAMLO, in fact, did not know what was \"good for him.\" \"How are we going to allow the US ambassador, with all due respect . . . to opine that what we are doing is wrong?\" he asked at his press conference the following Tuesday. While denying that the ambassador would be expelled, he explained that the relationship with the embassy was \"on pause.\" The same, he added, for the Canadian embassy, whose attitude in seconding the United States had been \"pitiful . . . like a vassal state.\" Both countries, he concluded, \"would like to interfere in matters that only concern Mexicans. As long as I am here, I will not allow any violation of our sovereignty.\" The battle lines had been drawn.\n\nThe ambassador's letter and accompanying press conference were all the more surprising in light of the fact that, two months prior, he had said the exact opposite. The judicial reform \"is a Mexican decision,\" he stated on June 13 . \"It is not our decision. We, the United States, cannot impose our opinions in those matters.\" On July 24, he reaffirmed that \"the model [of the reform] will be the decision of the Mexican government, of the Mexican legislature. I'm not going to get involved in what should be done.\" Just days before his U-turn, he was still saying that the judicial reform represented \"an opportunity to do good things,\" and that the United States was \"not in a position\" to tell Mexico what to do.\n\nFollowing his blunt club of a statement, Salazar continued to twist rhetorically in the wind. Faced with blowback not only from the president but from a public historically disinclined to look favorably on US interventionism, he first tried backing off, contending that his comments had been made in a \"spirit of collaboration\" as \"partners,\" and that he had \"the greatest willingness\" to dialogue on the issue. The faux détente, however, entirely missed the point that the judicial reform was not an issue for which \"dialogue\" with the United States was either requested or appropriate. Thus Salazar returned to the attack, doubling down on the Iraq and Afghanistan point in an interview for Milenio TV while asserting that the reform violated the \"spirit of the USMCA agreement\" - NAFTA's replacement - knowing full well he could not say that it violated the actual agreement. By September 3, he had been reduced to arguing that well, yes, the United States also elects judges, but only at the state level (where most cases are tried) and only in a few states ( actually forty-one , in whole or part), and that whether or not the press in attendance was \"with him\" or not, they were always welcome at the embassy.\n\nSuch an abrupt volte-face in posture clearly was not hatched in Mexico City but in Washington. The question, of course, is by whom. In the absence of power emanating from the Joe Biden White House, other power centers within the federal government have been rushing to fill in the void, stepping over each other in the process.\n\nAs a consequence, Latin American policy in recent months has been all over the place. When Ecuador invaded the Mexican embassy in April in flagrant violation of international law, the tepid State Department response was subsequently \"corrected\" by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. In the case of the Venezuelan election in August, Antony Blinken rushed to congratulate right-wing candidate Edmundo González only for spokesperson Matthew Miller to walk it back a few days later. And now the Mexican ambassador - already the subject of a front-page New York Times hit piece in 2022 for supposedly getting \"too close\" to AMLO - has been forced to fall on his sword and contradict his own statements made within the course of a week.\n\nOne candidate is the Drug Enforcement Administration, which has been running an operation to smear AMLO through pliant media voices in response to his limiting of its powers on Mexican soil. Another is the Blinken hawks at the State Department or one of the other intelligence agencies. A more obvious source for the change in discourse, however, is the business community, which has long made use of friendly judges and abused legal proceedings such as amparo (a form of preliminary injunction) to further its own interests in strategic areas such as banking , mining, energy, and water and block legislation that would seek to regulate them. For all the lurid warnings of how a democratically elected judiciary would open the door to greater cartel influence, the genuine concern of multinationals is rather that it would close the door on monied interests, their bribes, and the historically cozy relationship they've enjoyed with justices that has virtually guaranteed decisions in their favor.\n\nWhen AMLO fought to increase public control over Mexico's energy sector in the face of a slew of amparos and lawfare, Salazar - a longtime advocate for big energy both in and out of government - was also trundled out to express his \"serious concerns\" and threaten that the United States' differences on the matter \"might not have a solution.\" The law to rein in private energy was eventually thrown out by the Supreme Court in February in a contorted process that required the votes of just two of its eleven justices, on the grounds that it violated \"free competition\" and \"sustainable development.\" The ambassador-lobbyist had won. AMLO was determined that it would not happen again.\n\nThe furor over the energy reform was just the tip of the iceberg. Even before turning into a machine for striking down laws ( seventy-four so far during this administration) on the barest of pretexts, Mexico's judiciary had already become infamous as a cocktail club characterized by excessive salaries, perks, ethics scandals , and nepotism at the service of the oligarchy and other unsavory interests. This has taken multiple forms, such as forgiving tax debts, as in the case of the 640 million peso (US$32 million) \"adjustment\" granted to Totalplay, the telecom company owned by Mexico's third-richest person and notorious tax evader Ricardo Salinas Pliego. It has also taken the form of get-out-of-jail-free cards for wealthy suspects to walk away scot-free or, at worst, be sent home to face trials from comfortable house arrest; a macabre sport in Mexico has been waiting to see which new well-heeled individual will be sent through the revolving door, usually on Saturdays (hence the term sabadazo ), when there is less media coverage and when government offices are closed.\n\nAmong the long list of high-profile beneficiaries are names such as Emilio Lozoya , accused of triangulating money from the Brazilian company Odebrecht to the 2012 campaign of Enrique Peña Nieto; Rosario Robles , accused of funneling millions in social development funds through universities in the Peña administration in what was known as the \"Master Scam\"; Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca , the former governor of Tamaulipas who had been stripped of his immunity to face money laundering and organized crime charges, only for the Supreme Court to step in and quash the procedure, allowing him to flee to Texas; and most recently, Mario Marín , the former governor of Puebla, accused of ordering the torture of journalist Lydia Cacho for revealing the story of his presumed participation in a child pornography and trafficking ring. The treatment of such notables is particularly galling in a context where thousands of Mexicans without adequate connections and bank balances languish for years on end in prison before their cases ever come to trial.\n\nMaking matters worse has been the erratic and underhanded behavior of the gowned class in recent months. In May, it was revealed that Norma Piña, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, had held a private meeting with magistrates from the Federal Electoral Tribunal together with Alejandro Moreno, the president of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party.\n\nThe meeting was doubly troubling: first, for involving a leader of the political opposition, and second, for including several of the very magistrates who would be deciding the validity of the upcoming 2024 presidential election. According to WhatsApp conversations leaked from the gathering, Piña explicitly introduced Moreno to the other guests as her \"ally\" and \"friend.\" Instead of resigning, which the seriousness of the conflict of interest easily warranted, Piña has led the charge against the judicial reform, in recent days even leading the Court to join a judicial-branch work stoppage in protest.\n\nAs if that were not enough, a pair of federal judges attempted to wield the amparo injunction against Congress itself, ordering it to freeze its consideration of the reform and, in the event it were approved, to refrain from sending it to the state legislatures for ratification - a ludicrous and patently illegal judicial overreach, in short, that only reinforced MORENA's argument of the need for root-and-branch reform. In the midst of all this broke a scandal of Lourdes Mendoza, columnist for El Financiero newspaper, sending her column on the reform to Supreme Court justice Margarita Rios-Farjat for her \"green light\" - a timely reminder of the chummy relationship between the courts and the corporate press, all in the pursuit of common interests.\n\nAs a first step toward cleaning up the courts, the judicial reform provides for direct elections for half of the federal judiciary in 2025, including the entire Supreme Court, and the other half in 2027. All current justices will be eligible to run. Elections will be nonpartisan, with a prohibition on the use of private financing; instead, candidates will be given free television and radio airtime to make their case. Technical committees will be set up in both houses of Congress to ensure that potential candidates meet basic requirements of education and experience. The terms of Supreme Court justices will be reduced from fifteen to twelve years. Gender parity will be enforced, together with a limit on excessive trial lengths. Excessive salaries, perks, and pensions will be eliminated. The use of the amparo to block anything and everything will be reined in. And, crucially, an independent oversight board will be established with powers to sanction, suspend, or even remove corrupt judges from the bench.\n\nAnd while the judicial reform has become a lightning rod, it must be understood in the context of the other constitutional amendments the Mexican congress will be considering in the upcoming months, including greater autonomy for indigenous and afro-Mexican peoples; greater wage, housing, and pension protections; and a ban on fracking, open-pit mining, and GMO corn for human consumption. No wonder the multinational business community and their spokespeople in the embassies are worried, not only due to the limits the reforms will place on their ability to act with judicial-backed impunity but also for the fear that such a precedent could spread to places like the United States, which is just beginning to undertake its own, far more modest attempt to reform an unchecked and overweening Supreme Court. \" The fear of a good example ,\" as journalist and activist Eugene Puryear puts it, indeed.\n\nKurt Hackbarth is a writer, playwright, freelance journalist, and the cofounder of the independent media project \"MexElects.\" He is currently coauthoring a book on the 2018 Mexican election.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

What happened?\n\nMexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Queen Letizia of Spain at a state dinner in 2014. Presidencia de la República Mexicana / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn June 7, Mexican voters went to the polls for the country's midterm election, with over 2,100 different positions in local, state, and federal legislatures on the ballot.\n\nThe election arrived in a year of widespread social unrest in the country. Since the massacre of forty-three students in Iguala, Guerrero back in September, Mexico has witnessed one of the largest protest movements in recent history. There have been marches on the capital, riots around the country, and calls for the impeachment of President Enrique Peña Nieto. Pundits wondered if revolution were at hand . With so much anger directed at the ruling right-wing coalition, many hoped that the Left might \"turn outrage into political power.\"\n\nThey did not. Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) secured 203 seats in Congress, losing a mere 4 seats from its 207 in the 2012 election. Its losses were more than compensated for by the gains of Mexico's Green Party - an extraordinary misnomer for a corrupt, pro-fracking party - which nearly doubled their total seats to 47. The ruling coalition had little trouble reasserting its majority control of the legislature.\n\nSo how did the PRI emerge largely unscathed? How can we explain the fight for a new politics and the vote for the old politics? And why was the Left unable to capitalize on discontent?\n\nThe answer is an old one in Mexican politics: clientelism. By and large, Mexicans are not voting based on their opinion of their politicians - a recent survey showed that 91% of Mexicans consider political parties the most corrupt institutions in the country. Instead, they are voting based on local allegiances forged through local promises that have little to do with the actual platform of the party.\n\nWith a number of crucial national reforms on the table - including the right to water, housing, and basic security - the decisive role of these local exchanges is both disheartening and dangerous. Mexicans voters exercise little control over the broader direction of the country, even as its economic policy charges toward liberalization, privatization, and deregulation.\n\nIn order to challenge these trends, Mexico's left-wing parties must develop a new type of politics - one that centers less on short-term gifts and favors and more on the benefits of just policy. This, above all, is the lesson of the election: in the victory of clientelism, it is the Left that loses out.\n\nMuch of the mainstream coverage of the election has depicted a large-scale revolt at the polls. Pedro Kumamoto, a twenty-five-year-old independent candidate who became a symbol of the youth movement for change, secured a seat in a suburb of Guadalajara. Jaime Rodriguez, an independent candidate known as \"El Bronco\" for his foul-mouthed, everyman cowboy image, won the governorship in Nuevo León. According to Rodriguez, the election of independent candidates constitutes a \"second Mexican revolution.\" \"It's a sign that you can have a revolution at the polls,\" he said following his victory.\n\nMeanwhile, as part of the voto nulo movement, 4.9% of Mexican voters \"annulled\" their vote completely. Rather than abstaining, they showed up and invalidated their ballot, writing political messages or crossing out the entire ballot. Some public intellectuals advocated the voto nulo as a way to intensify the state's ongoing legitimacy crisis. Others claimed that the nullified votes - coming largely from the Left - only served to support Mexico's right-wing coalition. In the end, the 5% share could have constituted its own political party .\n\nYet the reference to a revolution at the ballot is both overly optimistic and downright misleading. Despite catching so many headlines, there were only two successful independent campaigns. The PRI's percentage of the vote remained almost exactly at its 2012 level, and it lost only a handful of seats at the federal level. Of the five governorships it held before the election, it retained three and gained another in the state of Guerrero - a perverse outcome for the state where the forty-three students were disappeared.\n\nIn fact, the election had less of an effect on the political landscape than almost any midterm election in two decades. In the 2003 midterm election, the ruling National Action Party (PAN) coalition lost 8% of the vote and 56 seats in Congress. In the following midterm election, in 2009, the PAN lost 6% of the vote and 59 seats in Congress. That year, the \"annulled\" vote - hailed this time around as a symbol of Mexico's ballot-box revolution - was even higher, at 5.39%.\n\nEven \"El Bronco,\" that much ballyhooed avatar of change, has dubious reform credentials. Cowboy hats and crude language aside, Rodriguez spent thirty years inside the PRI. While he claims to have rejected the party - or \" puked it up ,\" as he phrased it - there is no evidence that his independence will inform his administration's daily politics.\n\nIn fact, there is little indication that independence curtails clientelism. The Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), Mexico's largest left-wing party, also sought to break the party hierarchy. They offered significant local autonomy to participating factions. Their independence, however, did not prevent the emergence of clientelism. On the contrary, it only encouraged clientelism, without the accountability afforded by the PRI's centralized party control.\n\nThe prospects for change following this week's election appear slim. The machine of clientelism succeeded in drawing voter support for ruling coalition. And the \"revolution\" of independent candidacy offers little hope for a broader transformation of Mexican politics.\n\nClientelism in Mexico follows a regular pattern. First, political parties send their brokers - most of whom are aspiring politicians themselves - door-to-door to collect neighborhood grievances. Some residents are concerned about security; others are upset about the cost of water. Reporting back to the local representative, brokers and their parties then develop a strategy for each community. They may pledge to install streetlights to enhance neighborhood security, or most commonly, offer small gifts of 200 or 300 pesos - known as dispensas - to attract local support.\n\nThe gift-giving intensifies around election time. This year, for example, the PRI launched a massive campaign to distribute over 10 million free TVs through a network of local brokers - one guaranteed vote, one free television. The Green Party, for its part, offered thousands of free movie tickets in order to attract support. In Mexico City, the party even distributed goodie packs to its mailing lists, with a backpack, a watch, pencils, and notebooks inside.\n\nSuch vote-buying efforts are technically illegal. But the regulation of clientelism in Mexico is almost exclusively ex-post. The National Election Commission has castigated the Green Party time and again for its free giveaways, but the party simply finds new and creative ways to buy support ahead of the regulatory curve. And it paid off. The Green Party extended its congressional reach from 33 to 48 seats in the midterm election.\n\nYet the fiercest form of clientelism - and perhaps the most pervasive - emerges in the exchange between community organizations and the parties. Many local organizations in Mexico have ties to the ruling political parties, often a result of community leaders' entry into the party.\n\nThese links serve as powerful nexuses of welfare provision. Political parties will offer the organization access to new land, for example, in exchange for the support of the new residents that will populate it. In order to receive plots, residents are expected to attend rallies and vote for the local candidate. Clientelism becomes more than a mere handout - it is deeply tied to major welfare outcomes.\n\nIn addition, community leaders often bargain for themselves, not their communities. And participation in the clientelistic exchange becomes coercive. In the irregular settlements along the periphery of Mexico City - where community organizations are extremely powerful, as tenure rights are extremely weak - many organizations have threatened to evict their members if they failed to show vocal support leading up to the elections.\n\nThis coercive quid pro quo is what separates normal democratic politics from Mexico's pernicious clientelism. Rather than advancing collective welfare in the form of new rights, clientelism supports only individual welfare in the form of short-term payouts. Collective identities fragment into local ones. The fight for systemic, long-term change becomes a bargain for cheap, short-term gains.\n\nToday, as the national situation in Mexico continues to worsen - with simultaneous crises of drugs, water, and housing - why hasn't an alternative emerged? Why hasn't a citizen movement demanded change? And why haven't left-wing parties delivered it?\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, the Mexican left appeared to present a viable alternative to clientelism. Following decades of single-party rule, social movements were gathering momentum around the country. Led by mass leftist organizations like the Revolutionary Organization of the Left (OIR) and the Revolutionary Movement of the Pueblo (MRP), local groups fought for new constitutional rights that would challenge the PRI's clientelistic regime.\n\nIn 1988, following a major split in the PRI, a new political party emerged: the National Democratic Front (FDN). Led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas - son of the famous PRI president Lázaro Cárenas, a hero of the Mexican left - the FDN sought to build on the momentum of Mexico's social movements and take down the ruling PRI.\n\nCárdenas extended an olive branch to groups like the OIR and the MRP, promising both power and autonomy in exchange for participation. These leftist organizations and their grassroots members sensed a democratic revolution. Dispensing with their customary anti-state militancy, they entered into the FDN's 1988 election campaign, confident that their participation would not signal cooptation.\n\nWhile the FDN lost the election - possibly due to widespread election fraud - it formalized the participation of the Mexican left in the PRD. Many expressed skepticism about this shift, as the PRD contained so many elements of the old PRI regime.\n\nTheir reservations were warranted. The arrival of the PRD fragmented the social movements that undergirded the Mexican left. A major rift emerged between groups that chose to participate in electoral politics and those that chose to maintain their autonomy. Of the ones that chose to participate, entry into the political system dissolved broad left alliances. According to Kathleen Bruhn , protests among PRD-affiliated organizations fell by 50% when the party took power in Mexico City.\n\nOnce inside the party, community leaders began to compete on the same clientelistic bases as their right-wing opponents. Eager to maintain the energy of the democratization movement, the PRD had decentralized party control and opened its ranks to local leaders. But this pluralist strategy backfired. Many local leaders sought personal gain. Their links with the community became vehicles for garnering electoral support, not improving conditions.\n\nThe PRD lost its guiding left platform. In its broad coalition, each participating member could form its own current, with little regard for the pro-poor program of the PRD's founders. As a result, figures like José Luis Abarca - the mayor of Iguala, Guerrero responsible for the execution of the forty-three students - became PRD politicians.\n\nToday, at least at the local level, the PRD and the PRI are largely indistinguishable. They both have networks of brokers, and they both offer gifts and favors to voters. This was the background of the voto nulo movement: what's the point in voting when the crooks are all the same?\n\nThe story of the Mexican election is certainly grim. But the Left is not as weak as it may appear.\n\nLeft-wing parties secured a total of 28.2% of the vote - a higher percentage than in both the 2003 and 2009 midterm elections. These votes are, of course, more fragmented than ever. The PRD now competes for the left vote against the National Regeneration Movement (Morena) - which crushed the PRD in the Mexico City election - and the rising Citizen's Movement (MC) party. But if these parties can form a unified front, presidential victory in 2018 is in reach.\n\nIn order to form this coalition, the Mexican left must rediscover its guiding platform - not competing with itself for the support of clients, but coordinating in solidarity with the needs of citizens.\n\nClientelism is a cancer on the body politic. Once it is introduced, it infects political culture. It encourages short-term thinking, limits the possibilities for change, and demobilizes citizens that see little point in electoral politics beyond the election season goodies. The PRD's fall from grace is an excellent testament to this insidiousness. When one party begins to play the clientelistic game, it drags the others along with it.\n\nThe cure resides in civil society. Mexico's democracy has been strongest when its infrastructure of local, non-state organizations has been most robust. Left-wing parties today must focus on reigniting the grassroots movements that have been on the decades-long decline.\n\nThe widespread protests following Ayotzinapa sent a clear signal that the grassroots is ready to fight. But that signal was ephemeral. Within only a few months, protests faded, and the political status quo resumed. To turn outrage into political power, left-wing political parties must organize. Local assemblies, town halls, cooperatives - the Left must take an active role in establishing new arenas in which to channel discontent into political mobilization, and support the ones that exist already.\n\nShifting Mexico's \"apathetic\" political culture - in which electoral participation is just 50% - appears intractable. But this apathy is not the result of laziness or false consciousness. It is a resignation to the predetermined politics of clientelism. If the Left can succeed in establishing a grassroots infrastructure for political engagement, it can make the appeal of all those gifts and favors disappear.\n\nDavid Adler is policy coordinator at the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 and campaign coordinator at the Green New Deal for Europe.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Staving off these right-wing media attacks is an essential line of defense for the Left.\n\nMexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaks during a press conference in Hermosillo, Sonora, February 11, 2022.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe report had all the makings of a bombshell. Between 2019 and 2020, the son of the president of Mexico, José Ramón López Beltrán, and his wife, Carolyn Adams, rented a swanky house in Houston owned by the high-ranking executive of a firm that had received contracts from the state oil company, PEMEX. The report, a joint investigation by the organization Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity (MCCI) and the US-based Mexican website Latinus , set off a national feeding frenzy.\n\nDenunciations of collusion and kickbacks filled the airwaves, with fevered speculation that José Ramón had lived in the house for free as payback for favors received by the company Baker Hughes. Aerial views of the property and its pool filled television screens, and a model of the house was even set up on the floor of Congress. The opposition, it seemed, had finally found a scandal that would stick.\n\nThen it all began to fall apart. The owner of the house, Keith Schilling, declared that he had rented the house through an agency and did not know the couple personally. The newspaper La Jornada dug up the rental contract with the agency, proving this to be the case. For its part, Baker Hughes clarified that Schilling had been the head of the Canadian division at the time, and had never handled Mexican affairs. And the director of PEMEX pointed out that Baker Hughes, in addition to its sixty-year history as a contractor, was actually more favored by the two previous administrations than by the current one. The damning exposé had sputtered out into little more than unsubstantiated innuendo.\n\nThe house in Houston was not the only exposé directed against Andrés Manuel López Obrador's children to have misfired in recent months. At the end of November, the news site Aristegui Noticias came out with a highly billed investigation of its own, purporting to show that another of the president's sons, Andrés Manuel López Beltrán, was benefitting improperly from a government farm-aid program, Sembrando Vida, at a ranch the sons had inherited from AMLO's late first wife.\n\nThe assistance, which had to do with the planting of cacao at the ranch, was to have been channeled through an old family friend, Hugo Chávez Ayala, who was previously a member of the program's advisory council. The problem, as the authors of the article themselves admitted in a subsequent interview, is that the allegations were not supported by clear proof but rather constituted an \"inference from the data\" designed to \"open a conversation\" about the issue.\n\nAny wrongdoing on the part of presidents or family members should be investigated fully, of course. But what stands out about these two reports is how, in the voracious media climate of today's Mexico, the overweening desire to catch AMLO out can override standard journalistic due diligence.\n\nDisappointing as this is from Aristegui - which has a more solid record of reporting - it is not at all so from MCCI and Latinus . MCCI is the brainchild of leading opposition figure Claudio X. González that is financed by both USAID and the Reagan-founded National Endowment for Democracy (NED), whose board of directors includes such illustrious figures as pardoned Iran-Contra criminal and promoter of Central American genocide Eliott Abrams (NED also indirectly contributed to funding the Aristegui report through the journalistic platform Conectas ).\n\nLatinus , for its part, is a shadowy organization of mercenaries, which, from the safe distance of the corporate tax haven of Delaware , devotes itself ceaselessly to attacking AMLO with recycled personalities from the Televisa broadcasting network; calling it a \"news\" organization in any meaningful sense is to stretch the word well past its breaking point. The site is financed by a network of opposition politicians and companies led by the Madrazo family, old enemies of López Obrador from Tabasco, and key figures in the state government of Michoacán under disgraced former governor Silvano Aureoles, currently under investigation for the embezzlement and diversion of over $50 billion pesos (US$2.4 billion) in public resources.\n\nIn a political sense, however, pieces like the Houston house or the cacao ranch do exactly what they're supposed to do: create an ongoing impression of misconduct that seeps, with every headline, into public consciousness. At the same time, they provide opponents with handy attack lines on social media and foster an idea that \"they're all the same\" in order to undermine his anti-corruption message and relativize the crimes of his predecessors. While this is extremely unlikely to work with the president's impassioned base of supporters, the target of the strategy lies in the urban middle-class districts (like the ones in Mexico City that abandoned MORENA in last year's midterm elections ), whose voters plumped for AMLO in 2018 but are casting around, consciously or otherwise, for any excuse to return to the fold.\n\nAt his morning press conference on February 11, AMLO raised the stakes in the affair by revealing what he claimed to be the annual salary of the leading face of Latinus , Carlos Loret de Mola: some $35.2 million pesos (US$1.7 million), seventeen times more than the president and nearly four hundred times what the average Mexican worker makes. The response from Loret and his supporters was contradictory: on one hand, insisting that the information was untrue while, on the other, accusing the president of accessing confidential salary data and abusing his office. In short order, the hashtag #TodosSomosLoret had sprouted up on social media, with a raucous virtual rally being held in Twitter Spaces .\n\nIt was, to say the least, a curious choice of martyr. Carlos Loret de Mola has made a career out of staging and falsifying events in ways that violate every tenet of the journalistic canon. As a Televisa correspondent in Afghanistan in 2001, he launched his rise by staging a supposedly harrowing scene in front of an old Soviet tank, according to veteran war correspondent Jaime Hernández.\n\nIn 2005, he went one better - or worse - by narrating on live television the staged arrest of French citizen Florence Cassez and her partner Israel Vallarta, accused of kidnapping. The made-for-TV sting operation (the couple had actually been arrested two days earlier) led to a diplomatic row between Mexico and France, with Cassez eventually being freed for violations of due process; Vallarta, for his part, continues to languish in prison sixteen years later.\n\nAlthough Loret claimed to not have realized the arrest was fake, his denials were contradicted in a court hearing by his former associates on the program. Then, in the wake of the devastating Mexico City earthquake of 2017, Loret helped perpetuate the false story that a twelve-year-old named \"Frida Sofía\" was calling for help from beneath the rubble of a school. In this case, Loret and his cohost, Denise Maerker, blamed the navy for feeding them false information that they were unable to independently confirm, despite the network's privileged access to the scene. Few people anywhere, in short, have done as much to debase the profession of journalism as Carlos Loret de Mola.\n\nBut in a larger sense, Loret is simply a reflection of the media culture that created him. For decades, Mexico has been in the clutches of a powerful television duopoly comprised of Televisa - which has just completed a $4.8 billion merger with the US Spanish-language broadcaster Univision - and TV Azteca, product of the 1993 privatization of the public channel Imevisión , owned since its sell-off by business magnate Ricardo Salinas Pliego.\n\nFor its founders, it was very clear what the role of television in the country would be. \"Mexico is a country with a modest class that is very fucked . . . and will always be fucked,\" former Televisa president Emilio Azcárraga Milmo famously said . \"The obligation of television is to deliver entertainment to these people and take them out of their sad reality and their difficult future.\"\n\nFar from educating or informing, the goal was to incorporate the poor into a culture of consumerism, keeping them in their place and reaping fantastic profits as a result. Azcárraga Milmo accumulated a fortune estimated at over $5 billion; his son Emilio Azcárraga Jean, who ran the station until 2017, is worth approximately $770 million. TV Azteca's Salinas Pliego, the third-richest man in Mexico, is worth $12.9 billion . Despite this fortune, which has exploded during the pandemic, Salinas Pliego went all the way to the Mexican Supreme Court in a failed attempt to get out of paying fifteen years of back taxes worth $2.63 billion pesos (US$127 million) for his company the Elektra Group.\n\nAMLO's declaration of Loret de Mola's salary has given voice to a long-standing public grievance against an unaccountable caste of media moguls and airbrushed stars that has twisted the news industry to its very lucrative advantage. Unlike in the United States, where the salaries of top anchors and hosts is a matter of public knowledge , the amount taken home by their Mexican counterparts is shrouded in mystery - and considering over 14 million people continue to subsist on a minimum wage of around $8 a day , the excessive discretion is hardly surprising. Indeed, the panic running through the higher echelons of Mexican corporate journalism is not just that the public will discover how much these media personalities earn but where the money to pay those salaries comes from.\n\nAn embarrassingly large chunk of it, to start, came from previous governments in the form of publicity spending and the condonation of taxes. Before 2018, the three branches of government would shower print, television, and radio news outlets with generous largesse in the form of official publicity budgets: the government of Enrique Peña Nieto, for example - himself a soap-opera creation of Televisa - spent a staggering $60.2 billion pesos (US$3 billion) in this area. In turn, many of these outlets would shower the government with favorable - or at least not unfavorable - coverage.\n\nAs the process was fully legal, there was no need for any explicit quid pro quos. In addition, individual journalists with sufficient name recognition would form their own companies in order to pull down more official \"communications\" money. During Peña's tenure, some thirty-six journalists and their companies received over $1 billion pesos (US$50.7 million) in publicity cash, including many of the nation's top columnists and commentators. The leader was Televisa's longtime former news anchor Joaquín López-Dóriga, for example - owner of a luxury yacht and a slew of apartments in the high-rent Polanco district in Mexico City - who raked in some $251 million pesos through four different media companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Felipe Calderón and Peña governments together were condoning over $20 billion pesos (US$957 million) in taxes for Televisa, and another $7.7 billion pesos (US$365 million) for Grupo Salinas, owner of TV Azteca. All of this while the mass of journalists in Mexico continue to earn pitiful salaries, working the most dangerous beats where they are prime targets for extortion, disappearances, and murder at the hands of organized crime and corrupt local kingpins.\n\nA similar web of conglomerates, of course, plays out across Latin America under different names: Globo , Clarín , Mercurio . And every government that has genuinely sought to disrupt the status quo has faced an identical dilemma: play the co-option game, get walked all over, or stand up to the media overlords at the cost of being labeled authoritarian, dictatorial, or worse.\n\nThe fourth estate brooks no criticism and offers no apologies. And strangely enough, all of those who insist that a government such as AMLO's requires \"counterweights\" have no apparent problem with the extreme concentration of media power in Mexico and its near-uniform right-wing bias.\n\nCaught in the crosshairs, AMLO's Fourth Transformation has struggled to find a timely and compelling way to respond. While AMLO's morning press conferences have been effective, they have also had the counter-effect of concentrating communications activities in the presidency at the expense of other channels, such as surrogates, press secretaries, or a rapid-response team within MORENA that could pounce on matters immediately instead of waiting for the following morning or - on weekends - until Monday.\n\nThe defenses made by AMLO at the mañaneras , meanwhile, have remained at the level of the rhetorical. And while this has been often entertaining and useful in rallying the troops, it has done little to alter the media landscape in Mexico in any structural sense. To do that would require stiffer measures than the Fourth Transformation has, as yet, been willing to countenance. One immediate measure would be to crack down on informal and contract employment in the industry by preventing any media outlet that does not have its entire staff on direct contracts (with all the benefits prescribed by law) from receiving a peso in governmental publicity money. A second measure would be to radically reform the allocation of publicity itself, as well as restricting its scope, to prevent a return to the media-government money carrousel of the past.\n\nA third step would be to take serious steps toward creating a public media network with national reach, instead of the patchwork of local and state channels that exist at present. And finally, media licensing practices would have to be brought out into the open and reviewed. Although many of us don't stop to think about it, broadcasting outlets, as well as telecommunications companies, are licensees of a public good called spectrum - the waves on which signals are transmitted. And as Mexico's Constitution (Article 6) specifically states, radio and television constitute public services of general interest; in addition, according to Article 4 of the Federal Radio and Television Law , they must fulfill a social function. Telecommunications in particular, according to the Constitution, are to be provided in conditions of \"competition, quality, plurality, universal coverage\" - a provision that would clearly justify a sort of Fairness Doctrine like the one that existed in the United States until 1987. Licenses, moreover, are not an eternal present from the public, and, as in any other industry, licensees that fail to uphold the law must be required to do so or lose their concession. At the same time, spectrum space must be democratized and opened up to new voices. There can be no genuine plurality under oligopoly.\n\nIn the meantime, the one thing AMLO and MORENA can be absolutely sure of is that there will be more Houston house and cacao ranch stories to come. Without a comprehensive media strategy, a low-grade war of attrition will bide its time, launching its salvos, one by one, while waiting for the right moment to escalate significantly. Just ask Dilma Rousseff, Evo Morales, or Fernando Lugo.\n\nKurt Hackbarth is a writer, playwright, freelance journalist, and the cofounder of the independent media project \"MexElects.\" He is currently coauthoring a book on the 2018 Mexican election.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Here, he explains how privatization has pillaged the public - and calls for a break with the neoliberal order.\n\nAndrés Manuel López Obrador delivers a speech during the final event of the 2018 presidential campaign at Azteca Stadium on June 27, 2018 in Mexico City. Manuel Velasquez / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn terms of our collective wellbeing, the politics of pillage has been an unmitigated disaster. In economic and social affairs, we've been regressing instead of moving forward. But this is hardly surprising: the model itself is designed to favor a small minority of corrupt politicians and white-collar criminals. The model does not seek to meet the needs of the people, or to avoid violence and conflict; it seeks neither to govern openly nor honestly. It seeks to monopolize the bureaucratic apparatus and transfer public goods to private hands, making claims that this will somehow bring about prosperity.\n\nThe result: monstrous economic and social inequality. Mexico is one of the countries with the greatest disparities between wealth and poverty in the world. According to a 2015 article written by Gerardo Esquivel, a professor at the College of Mexico and a Harvard graduate, 10 percent of Mexicans control 64.4 percent of the national income, and 1 percent own 21 percent of the country's wealth. But most significantly, inequality in Mexico deepened precisely during the neoliberal period . Privatization allowed it to thrive.\n\nIt's also important to make note of the following statistic: in July 1988, when Carlos Salinas was imposed as president on the Mexican people through electoral fraud, only one Mexican family sat on the Forbes list of the world's richest people - the Garza Sada family, with $2 billion to their name. By the end of Salinas's term in office, twenty-four Mexicans had joined the list, owning a combined total of $44.1 billion. Nearly all had made off with companies, mines, and banks belonging to the people of Mexico. In 1988, Mexico sat at twenty-sixth place on a list of countries with the most billionaires; by 1994, Mexico was in fourth place, just beneath the United States, Japan, and Germany.\n\nAs is readily observed, economic inequality today is greater than it was in the 1980s, and perhaps greater than the periods before, though a lack of accurate records makes such comparisons difficult. Although Esquivel doesn't highlight it, inequality skyrocketed during Salinas's term, when the transfer of public goods to private hands was at its most intense. Under Salinas, the divide between rich and poor deepened like never before. Salinas is the godfather of modern inequality in Mexico.\n\nIt's clear, then, that privatization is not the panacea that its proponents would have us believe. If it were, beneficial effects would by now be visible. At this juncture it's fair to ask neoliberalism's supporters: how have Mexicans benefited from the privatization of the telecommunications system? Is it a mere coincidence that, in terms of price and quality, both phone and internet service in Mexico rank seventieth worldwide, far below other members of the OECD?\n\nWhat social benefits has the media monopoly conferred - other than to its direct beneficiaries, who have amassed tremendous wealth in exchange for protecting the corrupt regime, through brazenly slanted coverage of opposition candidates? What have we gained through the privatization of [Mexican state railroad company] Ferrocarriles Nacionales in 1995, if twenty-plus years later these outside investors haven't built new train lines, and can charge whatever they want for transport?\n\nHow have we benefited from the leasing out of 240 million acres, 40 percent of the country (Mexico has 482 million acres total) for the extraction of gold, silver, and copper? Mexican miners earn, on average, sixteen times less than those in the United States and Canada. Companies in this field have extracted in five short years as much gold and silver as the Spanish Empire took in three centuries. Most outrageously, up until recently they were extracting these minerals untaxed. In short, we are living through the greatest pillage of natural resources in Mexico's history.\n\nThis destructive policy has done nothing for the country. Statistics show that in the past thirty years we've failed to advance. To the contrary, in terms of economic growth we've fallen behind even an impoverished country like Haiti. The only constant has been economic stagnation and unemployment, which has forced millions of Mexicans to migrate or to make a living through the informal economy, if not resorting to crime. Half of the population is precariously employed with no safety net.\n\nThe widespread abandonment of agriculture, lack of job or educational prospects for our youth, and spiraling unemployment has resulted in insecurity and violence that have taken millions of lives. In the magazine Mundo Ejecutivo , Alejandro Desfassiaux reports that \"the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and the National Registry of Disappeared or Lost Persons (RNPED) reported over 175,000 homicides and 26,798 instances of missing people between 2006-2015.\" As Desfassiaux puts it, \"this violence affected countless others when family members are included.\"\n\nFor these reasons, it's illogical to think we can end corruption through the same neoliberal political and economic approach that has so patently failed in the past. To the contrary, until there's a deep and sustained change, Mexico will continue its decline. Our present course is unsustainable, and we are nearing the point of complete collapse.\n\nOur political economy today echoes the failures of the Porfiriato period at the end of the nineteenth century, when the prosperity of a few was placed above the needs of the many. That failed experiment culminated in armed revolution. The need to topple the PRIAN oligarchy and their ilk has never been greater, just as happened with Porfirio Díaz . But this time around we will not descend into violence, acting rather through a revolution of conscience, through an awakening and an organization of the pueblo to rid Mexico of the corruption that consumes it.\n\nIn short: instead of the neoliberal agenda, which consists of the appropriation for the few, we must create a new consensus that prioritizes honesty as a way of living and governing, and regains the great material, social, and moral wealth that was once Mexico's. We should never forget the words of José María Morelos two hundred years ago: \"Alleviate both indigency and extravagance.\"\n\nWe must ensure that the democratic state, through legal means, distributes Mexico's wealth equitably, subject to the premise that equal treatment cannot exist without equal access, and that justice consists of giving more to he or she who has less.\n\nAn excerpt from A New Hope for Mexico (2018), translated by Natascha Uhlmann and published in the UK and Commonwealth (minus North America, India, and Pakistan) by Pluto Press and in North America by OR Books .\n\nAndrés Manuel López Obrador is the president-elect of Mexico.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Obrador is the country's outgoing leader, and President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will take office on Oct. 1.\n\nMexicans were offended in 2015 when then-candidate Trump claimed that, in many cases, immigrants arriving in the U.S. illegally included \"criminals, drug dealers, rapists.\"\n\nAnd Mexico was shocked in 2019 when Trump as president threatened to close the border \"for a long time\" unless Mexican authorities stopped migrants from crossing. López Obrador said the two countries' economies were so intertwined that they couldn't bear a closure for even a month .\n\nLópez Obrador said that in a letter he planned to send next week, \"I am going to prove to him that migrants don't carry drugs to the United States,\" adding that \"closing the border won't solve anything, and anyway, it can't be done.\"\n\n\"They wouldn't last a month with the border closed,\" he said, referring to U.S. automakers and manufacturers who depend on a steady, uninterrupted supply of parts and finished products for their plants on both sides of the border.\n\nLópez Obrador also addressed a growing discomfort in the United States with the massive transfer of U.S. auto companies to lower-wage plants in Mexico.\n\nLópez Obrador claimed that moving auto production back to the United States \"would mean that on average, each automobile sold would cost U.S. citizens between $15,000 and $20,000 more.\"\n\nDespite the frequent frictions and Trump's belligerent statements, the two leaders had an outwardly amicable relationship between 2018 and 2020, with López Obrador agreeing to use Mexico's National Guard to make it harder for third-country migrants to cross Mexico to the U.S. border.

Suddenly, Mexico's poorest citizens were receiving a smaller portion of the spending and less money than under previous administrations.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Mexico's wealthiest started getting money they didn't really need.\n\nThe shift owed largely to a massive \"universal\" pension benefit for seniors that López Obrador launched on a chilly January day outside Mexico City in 2019, just weeks after taking office. He announced he was more than doubling the existing federal pension - it has since doubled again - and expanding it regardless of income to people who previously didn't qualify, like those who received another pension from their former employer.\n\nIf much more money isn't poured into the system, \"universal programs spread benefits more thinly over the whole population with the result that the people who were most in need get worse,\" said Robert Greenstein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"Poverty can go up. Inequality can be greater than it would be under a more targeted scheme.\"\n\nBut López Obrador's social programs have proven so popular that even the opposition candidates running to replace him in the June 2 election have promised to expand them. Some 28 million Mexicans will benefit from one of the programs this year. In Sunday night's final presidential debate, candidate Xóchitl Gálvez said she would lower the minimum pension age to 60 from 65.\n\nThe pension is the largest social program by budget in López Obrador's slate of handouts, far surpassing the also well known Youth Building the Future, which pays young adults who neither study nor work to apprentice, and Sowing Life, which pays farmers to plant fruit or lumber-producing trees on their land.\n\nCombined with the elimination of predecessors' more targeted programs that had focused on Mexico's most in need, experts say the pension dramatically shifted the distribution of government funds.\n\nFour months from the end of López Obrador's six-year term, several million people have escaped poverty. But factors beyond the social programs are involved, including López Obrador's nearly tripling of the minimum wage and Mexicans abroad continuing to send home record amounts of money to relatives.\n\nCuriously, there are about 400,000 more Mexicans in extreme poverty than at the beginning of his term, according to government data.\n\nA government report published every two years that divides Mexico's population into 10 segments by income says the very poorest segment in 2018 received about 19% of social spending. Just two years later, that poorest group was receiving only about 6%, said Manuel Martínez Espinoza, a researcher at Mexico's National Council of the Humanities, Sciences and Technologies. For reasons unknown the government has not published the 2022 report.\n\nAt a counter in a central Mexico City market, Arturo García leaned over a steaming bowl of tripe stew on a recent morning. The 73-year-old retired cab driver said he stopped taking fares during the pandemic.\n\nNow the $362 (6,000 pesos) he receives from his universal pension every two months and some money he gets renting out a storage space in his home to street vendors are his only sources of income.\n\n\"You have money or you don't have money, they give it to you,\" García said of the pension. \"The government is trying to make us all equal.\"\n\nOne of the programs López Obrador ended when he took office was called Prospera. It had targeted Mexico's poorest families for some two decades under various names with what were known as conditional cash transfers. Poor families received money, but it was restricted by income level and recipients had to meet some requirements to get it, like taking their children for medical checkups.\n\nThe president said the program was clientelist and suffered from systematic corruption, though instances of corruption have also been found in López Obrador's programs.\n\nTargeted social programs like Prospera attempt to be more precise in steering public funds to specific segments of the population. For that reason they tend to be less expensive than universal programs.\n\nCritics, however, say they stigmatize the poor; have less political support, which makes them vulnerable to being cut; require more administration to determine eligibility and fewer people enroll, said Greenstein, the fellow at the Brookings Institution, adding that those risks are not inherent in targeted programs.\n\nMexico's Welfare Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nProspera's funding was redirected to López Obrador's programs, principally the universal pension, signaling an important shift from a means-tested program that largely benefitted poor children to one that provided cash to all senior citizens.\n\nOne of the more cynical criticisms of the shift is that children don't vote, but seniors do.\n\nThe other side of Mexico's poorest receiving a smaller proportion of social spending under this administration is that people who don't really need it are getting more.\n\nOne morning in late April, César Herrera brought his elderly mother to a branch of the Banco Bienestar, or Welfare Bank, in Mexico City to withdraw her pension payment. The bank was created by López Obrador as a vehicle to get payments from his administration's programs directly into the hands of Mexicans.\n\nHerrera said he and his mother had driven by in February when the last pension deposit was made and saw the line stretching down the street. But unlike many seniors who live payment to payment, Herrera said his mother didn't need the money, so they left.\n\n\"However, it's there,\" he said when they returned a month and a half later. \"Of course you have to take it.\"\n\nThe ninth out of 10 income strata, or the second highest, analyzed by the government went from receiving about $4.40 of every $100 in social spending in 2018 to getting about $10 in 2020, said Martínez, the researcher at the humanities, sciences and technologies council.\n\nMartínez said his field work in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state, found many people who were not receiving as much money as they had previously under Prospera, but who nevertheless fervently supported López Obrador.\n\n\"I've talked with a lot of people in my field work, they feel valued, they feel the president values them, which they didn't feel before,\" Martínez said.\n\nMartínez hypothesizes that the growth in extreme poverty during this administration was due in part to the elimination of Prospera but also the fact that people in extreme poverty tend to work in the informal sector - which would not have benefited equally from the increased minimum wage. Another factor was the COVID-19 pandemic forced a lot of families to exhaust their limited savings on health care.\n\nMuch of the back-and-forth between López Obrador's anointed successor Claudia Sheinbaum and the opposition candidate Gálvez has been the president and Sheinbaum insisting that Gálvez will end the social programs if she wins - and Gálvez promising that she won't. Much of that debate is unnecessary since the pension is now enshrined in the constitution.\n\nMartínez said that even at the current 65 minimum age the program is burning through public funds too rapidly.\n\n\"In the short term, it's a time bomb because it's going to generate problems because it isn't fiscally sustainable,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

He collected his children and grandchildren and fled on foot across the border to Guatemala.\n\nThey left behind their animals, documents, money and took off running, among nearly 600 people who fled various communities of Amatenango la Frontera this week to escape warring drug cartels that have terrorized the rural borderlands of southern Mexico.\n\n\"I left my home because of the shooting, and out of fear,\" said the farmer, who requested anonymity for his family's safety. \"The cartels kill even the innocent.\"\n\nThey walked more than 2 miles (4 kilometers) over the mountains and through thick brush until they found a path that brought them to Ampliacion Nueva Reforma, an impoverished Guatemalan hamlet in the Cuilco municipality.\n\nIn this single community, more than 200 Mexican refugees have arrived in recent days. Locals have scrambled to shelter them in their modest school and collect donations of food and water.\n\n\"Thank God they gave us a hand, gave us a tea to calm our fear,\" the man said. \"We're afraid to return. There's no authority to fight them. What we ask of the government is to intervene and help us out and send the Mexican army.\"\n\nGuatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo said Wednesday his administration would coordinate the humanitarian response though there was little sign of it yet. Still, that was more than came from the Mexican side where authorities did not respond to requests for comment about the situation and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not even mention it during his daily briefing Thursday of more than three hours.\n\nA 42-year-old woman who identified herself only as Karla to protect her family, said she fled Sunday with her four children.\n\n\"With the shootouts you couldn't leave your home to look for food, imagine what I could give my children to eat,\" she said. \"We don't know how much longer this is going to last. We don't know if we'll be able to return.\"\n\nNoel Pérez, mayor of Ampliacion Nueva Reforma, was preparing for what might be an extended stay. He said the refugees needed basic supplies, hygiene products and a large tent. \"So far, not the mayor (of Cuilco), nor the government has given us help and it's urgent that they they attend to these people.\"\n\nCatholic Church leaders in southern Mexico made their own plea for the Mexican government to protect the communities from cartels, which extract protection payments and use locals as human shields.\n\nA letter dated Wednesday and signed by Bishop Emeritus Jaime Calderón of the Tapachula Diocese, which includes parishes near the border with Guatemala, begged for government help.\n\nTwo of Mexico's most powerful cartels from the northern states of Sinaloa and Jalisco have been battling for control of smuggling routes in the area for more than a year causing multiple displacements.\n\nOn Wednesday, Arévalo said his administration was coordinating with the local governments near the border to attend to the Mexicans \"who are escaping conflict between groups that is taking place on the Mexican side.\"\n\nA Guatemalan government report obtained by The Associated Press described accounts from the refugees of having to abandon their homes because of a lack of food and fighting between organized crime groups. They arrived in communities of the Cuilco municipality. Among the 580 people were men, women, children and elderly.\n\nThe diocese's letter says communities long mired in poverty and ignored by the government must now also suffer being \"hostages in their communities, paying extortion to the corresponding cartel based on where they live, being forced to take shifts at roadblocks that impede free transit.\"\n\nResidents have to use what little money they have to pay for scarce items at elevated prices because the shopkeepers also are being extorted. And between July 20-22, the situation worsened as residents were \"intimidated, threatened and forced to be human shields in the clashes between drug cartels.\"\n\nThe letter does not refer specifically to those who fled to Guatemala, but it said that while Mexico's military and National Guard are present, they do nothing to intervene to protect the communities.\n\n\"What do we have to do or say so that the government carries out its duty, at least, to protect and watch out for the security of the communities?\" the letter asks.\n\nIn June, some 5,000 people were displaced by violence in another part of Chiapas after armed men set houses on fire in the town of Tila.\n\nIn September of last year, Mexico's president conceded the cartels had cut off electrical power in some Chiapas towns near the border with Guatemala , and forbidden government workers from coming in to the largely rural area to fix power lines.\n\nOn Thursday, the Mexican government's silence continued.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Though she's not religiously observant, Sheinbaum identifies as culturally Jewish and has spoken about her heritage in the past.\n\n\"I grew up without religion. That's how my parents raised me,\" Sheinbaum, 61, said in 2018 at gathering hosted by a Jewish organization in Mexico City. \"But obviously the culture, that's in your blood.\"\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Jews who immigrated to Mexico from Bulgaria before the Holocaust, while her paternal grandparents had fled from Lithuania in the 1920s. Sheinbaum's parents were born in Mexico.\n\nWhile campaigning, Sheinbaum said she considers herself a woman of faith but is not religiously affiliated ; perhaps that's why there has been relatively little discussion about her becoming Mexico's first Jewish president.\n\nTessy Schlosser, a historian and director of the Mexican Jewish Documentation and Research Center in Mexico City, said that for Mexicans of Jewish heritage, approval and expectations of Sheinbaum's government seem to align more with \"her personal political preferences than with her Jewish ancestry.\"\n\nEven Jewish newspapers in Mexico mostly focused on her historic win as the first woman to lead the country, barely mentioning her Jewish background.\n\n\"Sheinbaum, whose [ancestors] immigrated to Mexico escaping poverty and antisemitism, including the Holocaust, grew up in a secular, science-driven household. She doesn't perform her Jewish identity in public,\" said author and Amherst University humanities professor Ilan Stavans , who is also Mexican and Jewish and has written extensively about the Jewish diaspora in Latin America.\n\nSheinbaum was a physicist and climate scientist before she went into politics; her father was a chemical engineer, and her mother was a cell biologist.\n\nStill, Sheinbaum's ascent to the presidency is significant, Stavans said.\n\n\"The election of Claudia Sheinbaum as Mexico's first female Jewish president is a benchmark for the Jews of Latin America, whose presence in the region goes back to the arrival of Columbus and his crew at the end of the 15th century,\" Stavans said.\n\nHer election has opened a door toward a greater understanding of the history of Jews in Mexico, especially after local political figures used her heritage to launch attacks against Sheinbaum, questioning whether she was born in Mexico or was even Mexican.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Jewish people live in Mexico. The majority are settled in Mexico City and its surroundings, with small communities in the cities of Monterrey, Guadalajara, Tijuana, Cancún, San Miguel de Allende and Los Cabos.\n\nThe first Jews arrived in Mexico in 1519, along with the Spanish colonization. The community began to grow substantially by the early 20th century, as thousands of Jews fled from the Ottoman Empire to escape instability and antisemitism.\n\nThe Mexican Jewish community is formed by Ashkenazi Jews, from Central and Eastern Europe, and Sephardic Jews, mainly from Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain and Syria.\n\n\"Jewish identity encompasses many areas, including cultural, not just religious. Under these parameters, although Sheinbaum is not part of the organized Jewish community, her family's history is part of Mexican Jewish tradition and history, as she herself assumes,\" Schlosser said in Spanish.\n\nMexico remains overwhelmingly Christian, with nearly 100 million Catholics and 14 million Protestants, according to a 2020 census.\n\nSheinbaum's win also comes at a critical time as the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has displaced more than 1 million Palestinians and left more than 35,000 people dead, according to officials in Gaza.\n\nSince the beginning of the war last year, Sheinbaum has condemned attacks on civilians. She even called for a cease-fire and said she supports a two-state solution.\n\nHer stance echoed views she wrote in a 2009 letter to the editor of La Jornada , a Mexican newspaper, condemning what Sheinbaum described as \"the murder of Palestinian civilians\" during an Israeli bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Her loyalties are with the oppressed and downtrodden. In the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, she sides with the former without rejecting the latter, favoring a two-state solution, which these days appears more untenable that in recent memory,\" Stavans said.\n\nSheinbaum begins her six-year presidential term on Oct. 1.\n\n\"Her sheer arrival\" to the presidency, Stavans said, will generate interest in Jewish Latin Americans' rich history and culture.\n\nNicole Acevedo and Arturo Conde reported from New York and Albinson Linares from Mexico City.\n\nI am a bilingual national reporter specializing in issues affecting Latino communities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nArturo Conde is an editor and a bilingual freelance journalist.

There is no water. The scarcity is too much,\" said Otlica Reyes, a 46-year-old waiter who since 2016 has been part of the Río Frío Conservation Group, an association focused on environmental protection.\n\nFor Otlica Reyes, the most worrying thing is not only the serious effects of the scarce rains on the area's crops, but also the threat that looms over the volcano axolotl ( Ambystoma leorae ), an amphibian in critical danger of extinction. It receives its name from its habitat near the Telapón and Tláloc volcanoes, in the mountainous enclave known as the Sierra Nevada, east of Mexico City. In that area are the Tula and Río Frío streams, which are the only places where this species of axolotl develops.\n\n\"We had never felt this heat, nor had we seen this drought,\" Otlica Reyes said dejectedly in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \"There is no river precipitation. We don't have any of that and right now that is the greatest danger we have for the axolotls.\"\n\nAxolotls belong to the genus Ambystoma and are a species of neotenic salamander, which means these animals maintain some juvenile characteristics throughout their reproductive life.\n\nFelipe Osuna López, an academic at the Colegio de la Frontera Sur and member of the Río Frío Conservation Group, said that axolotls are of great importance in the ecosystem because they are the main predator in the streams and help maintain the biological balance in the area.\n\n\"They are a bioindicator par excellence; they keep the invertebrate population at bay and with that they contribute to maintaining the quality of the water,\" Osuna López explained. \"If the axolotls are well, it means that the water bodies are in good condition and that guarantees the water supply for thousands of people in neighboring communities.\"\n\nAxolotls live in rivers and streams, so the characteristics of these habitats have determined their evolution. This has made them very vulnerable to changes in these bodies of water, Osuna López said. This has caused a notable decline in their population from factors related to the modification of their habitat, such as river pollution, according to a 2018 study by Mexico's Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nOsuna López along with Otlica Reyes and others launched a fundraising campaign to save the axolotls that are languishing and dying in the area's bodies of water. According to their estimates, there are fewer than 200 specimens of this species left in the area's streams.\n\n\"For the first time, in this dry season, water stopped flowing in the Tula stream and became stagnant, so the axolotls clung to survival,\" Osuna López said. \"Fortunately, we were able to detect it in time and we took on the task of relocating the axolotls to areas that have better conditions.\"\n\nThe axolotl population had increased in numbers, according to Osuna López. \"The bad thing is that in Tula, where we had the largest population, the lack of monitoring and presence meant that these climatic attacks were not detected in time and the population was reduced,\" he said.\n\nThe most recent figures from the National Water Commission (Conagua) show that the absence of rain is a national problem: 67.97% of the Mexican territory shows moderate to exceptional drought, which affects ecosystems and has generated an increase of 60% in forest fires.\n\nIn the case of the volcano axolotls, the campaign launched by the Río Frío Conservation Group seeks to raise 65,000 Mexican pesos (about $3,900) for monitoring work, maintenance of bodies of water and educational campaigns with the community, among other activities.\n\n\"This is a reactive strategy to overcome this dry season and help the axolotls. We are relocating them, we are monitoring them and maintaining the levels of the pools so that they have the conditions to survive,\" Osuna López said. \"In the medium term we need to restore, to the extent possible, these streams so that they can retain a greater amount of water.\"\n\nThe Mexican axolotl has great importance in the country's culture that dates back to pre-Hispanic times. The Aztecs viewed the axolotl as a manifestation of Xolotl, the twin god associated with death and transformation.\n\n\"The axolotl appears for the first time in pre-Hispanic codices and is associated with Aztec deities. The axolotl was the twin brother of Quetzalcoatl and this is how it is represented in mythology. Culturally, this amphibian is part of our identity,\" said Diana Vázquez Mendoza, a researcher at the Ecological Restoration Laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Institute of Biology.\n\nThe genus Ambystoma is made up of 33 species distributed throughout North America, from southwest Alaska and southern Canada to the Mexican Highlands. According to data from the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources , in Mexico's case, there are 17 species distributed in the northeast and center of the country.\n\nOf that total, 16 are endemic, as is the case of the specimens of Ambystoma leorae, better known as the volcano axolotl, and the Ambystoma mexicanum, which are the best known axolotls and are found in Xochimilco, an area south of Mexico City that is well known for its network of canals that surround agricultural plots called chinampas.\n\nThe volcano axolotl species is much smaller than, for example, the Xochimilco axolotl, according to Osuna López. \"Our species is on average about 15 centimeters from the snout to the tail. And it presents a great morphological variation. We have gray, black, browns, yellows. We had greens, even with reddish tones, but unfortunately they have already been lost,\" he said.\n\nVázquez Mendoza said that axolotls, as they are amphibians, \"are very delicate animals that are very sensitive to environmental changes due to the type of skin they have and their morphology. And it is evident that there is a problem of climate change that is affecting ecosystems at a local level.\"\n\nThe researcher explained that the Xochimilco axolotls are also in danger due to the urbanization of areas near their habitats, changes in environmental conditions, and the pollution of canals and other wet areas where the species develops.\n\nFor Otlica Reyes, what happens with the axolotls is not an isolated event, he said with concern. Communities need to be continuously aware so they can mobilize and protect their local flora and fauna.\n\n\"It is not a problem for the axolotls, but for the entire community, both people and other living beings,\" he said. \"We all need water, but right now the axolotls are really missing it.\"\n\nAn earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Because they are born to parents of Mexican nationals, Mexico considers Mexican-American children also Mexican nationals, so they were included in the overall total.\n\nDuring the same time frame, an estimated 870,000 Mexican immigrants left Mexico to come to the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the same data sources from Mexico and the U.S. showed that the overall flow of Mexicans between the two countries is the smallest it has been since the 1990s.\n\nA majority of the Mexican immigrants who left the U.S. for Mexico between 2009 and 2014 did so on their own, according to a Mexican survey cited in the Pew report. That same survey found that 61 percent cited family reunification as the top reason for why they chose to go back to Mexico. Another 14 percent said they returned because they were deported from the U.S. and 6 percent cited to find a job or because they got a job in Mexico.\n\nAna Gonzalez-Barrera, Pew researcher and author of the report, said these findings are not surprising given that the Mexican-born population in the U.S. has been declining since it peaked at 12.6 million in 2007. What is significant, she said, is that there hadn't been any evidence to show that the net flow from Mexico to the U.S. was negative until now.\n\n\"We finally have the evidence to show that the net flow is negative,\" Gonzalez-Barrera said.\n\nThe Pew report points to several reasons that could explain the reduction of Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. in recent years, including the slow recovery of the U.S. economy following the latest Great Recession, which lasted from late 2007 through mid 2009.\n\nAnother reason could be stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border. The report also noted that increased enforcement in the U.S. has led to a rise in the number of Mexicans who've been deported since 2005.\n\nRELATED: Cruz, Rubio, and the immigration fight the GOP hoped to avoid\n\nObama had been the target of protests last year and earlier for his administration's record deportation numbers, which were totaling more than 300,000 a year. Immigration activists and Latino groups had dubbed him \"deporter-in-chief\" for the high deportation rate.\n\nAdditionally, his administration focused enforcement on people who had been removed previously from the country and were caught trying to re-enter illegally.\n\nBut the administration also enacted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to shield from deportation some 700,000 young immigrants here illegally and has tried to shield millions more. The latest effort has been blocked in the courts by Republican governors.\n\nToday, an estimated 11.7 million Mexicans live in the U.S., down from 12.8 million in 2007. This decline, according to the report, has been mostly due to the smaller number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants currently living in the U.S. There were 6.9 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico living in the U.S. in 2007. That number has dropped to 5.6 million.\n\nThe Pew report comes at a time when immigration has become a hotly contested issue in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates largely agree on immigration policy. They support immigration reform with a path to citizenship and agree with Obama's recent executive actions to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates, on the other hand, support an increase in border enforcement and some want those here illegally deported. Most believe Obama overstepped his authority when he announced his executive actions on immigration last year.\n\nInterestingly, in the 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney supported \"self-deportation\" as immigration policy. The concept was to make life so difficult for immigrants here that they would leave on their own. He lost to Obama in part because he captured only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.\n\nMark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center, said he doesn't know how much of an impact the Pew findings will have in this presidential race.\n\nRELATED: This is where the country's most infamous fence ends\n\n\"But certainly this is a topic area that the candidates have been talking about,\" he said, adding that several of the Democratic candidates in recent debates have referred to a 2012 Pew report that found the net migration from Mexico to the U.S. had reached zero.\n\nLopez also noted that the rise in the number of Asian immigrants coming to the U.S. could impact the immigration debate. He said China and India send the most immigrants to the U.S. each year, and that most Asian immigrants come to the U.S. through the legal immigration system to pursue an education or to work.\n\n\"It's interesting that migration from Mexico appears to now be turning towards Mexico at the same time that migration from Asia seems to be on the rise,\" Lopez said. \"So perhaps the debate about immigration might turn towards legal immigration.\"\n\nSome candidates have called for fixing legal immigration policies and billed themselves as legal immigration supporters.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com .\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Their parents fear, though there has been no official confirmation, that their sons were among the 53 migrants found dead Monday afternoon inside the back of a tractor-trailer in San Antonio, asphyxiated in the scorching heat of the Texan desert.\n\nAt least 27 of those dead in the truck were from Mexico, while the rest were from Central America, underscoring a disquieting trend. After declining for more than a decade, the number of Mexicans seeking to migrate to the United States is surging. Since 2020, a combination of growing violence across Mexico and a worsening economy has led to the first jump in Mexican migration in a decade.\n\nAs a result, Mexico is becoming an increasing challenge in Washington's effort to deter migrants from entering the United States across its southern border.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Some experts question if the government is really ready to reabsorb them.\n\nBy Emiliano Rodríguez Mega and Annie Correal\n\nReporting from Mexico City\n\nMexico's plan to receive thousands of its deported citizens from the United States is nothing short of ambitious. Plans are underway to build nine reception centers along the border - massive tents set up in parking lots, stadiums and warehouses - with mobile kitchens operated by the armed forces.\n\nDetails of the initiative - called \"Mexico Embraces You\" - were revealed only this week, although Mexican officials said they had been devising it for the past few months, ever since Donald J. Trump pledged to conduct the largest expulsion of undocumented immigrants in U.S. history.\n\nNearly every branch of government - 34 federal agencies and 16 state governments - is expected to participate in one way or another: busing people to their hometowns, organizing logistics, providing medical attention, enrolling the recently returned in social welfare programs like pensions and paid apprenticeships, along with handing out cash cards worth about $100 each.\n\nOfficials say they are also negotiating agreements with Mexican companies to link people to jobs.\n\n\"We are ready to receive you on this side of the border,\" Mexico's interior minister, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, said at a news conference this week. \"Repatriation is an opportunity to return home and be reunited with family.\"\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has called the expected large-scale deportations a \"unilateral move\" and has said she does not agree with them. But as the country with the single largest number of unauthorized citizens living in the United States - an estimated four million people as of 2022 - Mexico has found itself obligated to prepare.\n\nThe government's plan is focused on Mexicans deported from the United States, though the president has indicated the country could temporarily receive foreign deportees, too.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Jesus Miranda is from Michoacán and owns a taco restaurant here. He'll advise the council on housing development and other issues.\n\nMr. Miranda's appointment is hardly national news. But small moments like these are signs of a historic change of heart toward America and civic engagement among Mexican immigrants, many of whom, like Mr. Miranda, have been here for decades. No place offers a clearer view of this change than the suburbs southeast of Los Angeles.\n\nSouth Gate (pop. 96,000) and its neighbors were mostly farmland until the 1930s, when migrants from the Midwest and later World War II veterans moved to work in the factories of Chrysler, G.M., Firestone and Bethlehem Steel. Subdivisions sprouted. Towns emerged with bucolic names: Maywood, Huntington Park, Bell Gardens. Union jobs sustained a civic ecosystem of local newspapers, Rotary Clubs and Fourth of July parades.\n\nThen, in the late 1970s, the factories started leaving, and so did the white people. Their civic institutions atrophied. By 1990, towns like South Gate that had been 90 percent white were more than 90 percent Latino.\n\nThe new residents, crucially, were not from East Los Angeles, where Mexican-Americans had developed an activist political tradition since the 1960s. Instead, they were Mexican, straight from the ranchos - small villages on Mexico's frontiers, far from the center and from government. Most came here to work in jobs they believed, even after decades, would be temporary. They focused their lives on returning home someday. They packed into cheap housing and spent their savings on building homes back in Mexico.\n\nMexican rancho culture valued self-reliance and hard work. But rancheros also shunned politics, and, in particular, the paternalistic embrace of the PRI, the party that ran Mexico like Tammany Hall for 71 years. Immigrants brought that history with them, and in the dense southeast enclaves, their attitudes didn't change.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The reason is simple: The study considered not just where people finished, but from where they started.\n\nThe report serves as counter-point to arguments raised by Amy Chua, a Yale Law School professor better known as the Tiger Mom. In a new book, The Triple Package, Chua and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, argue that some groups-namely Chinese, Jews, Cubans, and Nigerians-are more successful than others because they possess certain cultural traits that enable them to be.\n\nIn a nutshell, Chua's \"Triple Package\" includes: a cultural superiority complex, impulse control, and insecurity. Combined, the authors assert, these traits drive the groups to succeed within a broader American culture that is comparatively lackadaisical. They base their argument on an analysis of test scores, educational achievement, median household income, and other factors.\n\nThe UC study, however, argues that it's not any specific cultural trait that makes groups like Chinese-Americans more successful than others. Lee and Zhou say both Chinese-American and Mexican-American parents highly value education. Most parents do. But the reason Chinese-Americans get ahead is because they start ahead. Way ahead, in many cases.\n\nThe study, called \"The Success Frame and Achievement Paradox: The Cost and Consequences for Asian-Americans,\" looked at Chinese-, Vietnamese-, and Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles whose parents immigrated to the U.S. At first glance, the study's findings seem to reinforce claims made by Chua and her supporters: Children of Chinese immigrants far exceeded other groups when it came to educational outcomes. Sixty-four percent of Chinese immigrants' children graduated from college, compared to 46 percent of native-born whites in L.A. Of the Chinese-American college graduates, 22 percent went on to attain graduate degrees.\n\nAsian-American kids, the study found, have good role models and extra help from family and community when it comes to schooling. They also benefit from well-educated parents who put them in good schools and push them into high-income, high-status professions, including medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and law.\n\nMexican-Americans had the lowest level of educational attainment in the study. Eighty-six percent had graduated from high school, compared to 100 percent of the Chinese-Americans, and just 17 percent had graduated from college.\n\nFundamental to Chinese-Americans' overall level of success is that their parents are already highly educated. Chinese immigrant parents were by far the most highly educated in the study-in L.A., 60 percent of Chinese immigrant fathers and 40 percent of Chinese immigrant mothers had a bachelor's degree or higher. According to a separate study by Pew Research Center, 61 percent of recent Asian immigrants between the ages of 25 and 64 had a bachelor's degree, which is more than double the U.S. average.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexican-Americans' high school graduation rate was more than double that of their parents, and their college graduation rate more than doubled that of their fathers and tripled that of their mothers. According to Lee, the results are clear: When success is measured as progress from generation to generation, Mexican-Americans come out on top.\n\nThe study found that Mexican parents strongly value education, but that their frame of academic achievement is less exacting than Chinese-American parents. They emphasize finishing high school, possibly going to college-though not necessarily an elite one-and having some kind of career. Mexicans aspiring to higher education, the study found, look toward good colleges in the L.A. area, and often settle on community colleges in their neighborhoods. Because many Mexican parents have a relatively low level of education, they were not as well-equipped to help their children succeed as Chinese-American parents.\n\n\"My mom never said to me to, 'Get an A.' She said, 'Do your best,'\" Nadia, a 28-year-old second-generation Mexican-American who is working toward her master's in education, told the researchers. Nadia was the first in her family to go to college and pursued a graduate degree even though her parents didn't understand the point of staying in school beyond a bachelor's degree.\n\nLee found that second-generation Mexican-Americans who attained the highest education outcomes had access to public resources at their schools such as zero periods, College Bound programs, and AP classes, in which students learned how to apply for colleges. Many also had a teacher, guidance counselor, or coach who encouraged them along the way and guided them through the college application process.\n\nConsider Camille, one of the study's subjects. A 27-year-old second-generation Mexican woman who earned a bachelor's and master's degree from the University of Southern California, Camille's parents arrived in the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants and worked in garment factories. Her parents wanted her and her twin sister to attend college but had no way to help them.\n\nAfter high school, the twins attended a local community college, where Camille met a guidance counselor who guided her through the admissions process to a four-year college. After Camille was accepted by USC, the counselor visited her parents to persuade them of the merits of allowing their daughter to leave home for school. \"She really went above and beyond,\" Camille said.\n\nThe point of the study, Lee says, was to reframe the debate about what success means.\n\n\"We wanted to understand how parents' position and parents' immigration status, how their level of education, how all of these factors then shape how the second generation frames success,\" she says. \"We really wanted to reframe the debate about success.\"\n\nPhoto by ZÃ3calo Public Square\n\nLee says that in the U.S., Asian-Americans benefit from a broad cultural belief in \"Asian-American exceptionalism\"-that Asians are inherently brighter and more hard-working than others-while other groups, such as Mexican-Americans and African-Americans, are subjected to negative stereotypes.\n\nIn elite U.S. universities, Asian-Americans make up a disproportionate percentage of the student population. Although they comprise just 5.5 percent of the American population, Asian-Americans account for just under one-fifth of the entering class at schools such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. At University of California, Berkeley, they make up 43 percent of the student body, but they are just 13 percent of the state's population. Chinese parents also define success narrowly and invest their resources in their sons and daughters achieving it. (This is also, Lee says, why you don't see many Chinese-Americans in careers such as writing, acting, fashion, and art.)\n\nLee argues that Asian-American students gain from this \"stereotype promise\"-the idea that being viewed through the lens of positive stereotypes can serve as a performance booster. In her research, she has found that positive stereotypes about Asian-Americans are reinforced in schools by teachers, guidance counselors, and administrators. In some cases, Asian students with mediocre grades in junior high were placed in advanced classes in high school regardless. (Stereotype promise can have a negative effect as well; Asian-Americans who are not high achieving reported feeling like outliers.)\n\nComparing different ethnic groups and their places in society, Lee often uses a baseball analogy. Asian-Americans, she says, tend to end up on the third base of life. But \"their parents are so highly-educated, they almost start the race to get ahead on third base,\" Lee says. \"But all we see is that they've made it to third base. That's not to say they don't work hard to get there. They do. But they have certain advantages that other groups don't have.\"\n\nMexican-Americans, Lee says, are starting from behind home plate. \"In the sense that they come [to the U.S.] much more poorly educated than the average American, they have a lot more catching up to do just to get to where the average American is. For Mexican-Americans, the fact that their children make it to first or second base is enormous progress.\"\n\nMitch Moxley has written for publications including GQ , the Atlantic , and Grantland , and he is the features editor at Roads & Kingdoms .

      "text": "The Mexican Elites Who Are Traveling to the U.S. to Get Vaccinated\n\nBeginning in February, Jose Andres Marroquin, a 56-year-old pilot from Monterrey, in northern Mexico, began receiving up to 50 anxious calls a day from people asking if he could fly them to Texas on a private jet. These were not his usual clients visiting properties or businesses in the U.S.-they were people desperately seeking a ride to Texas for a precious COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThere is an old Mexican joke: God tells a Mexican he has only a week left to live but can ask for one final wish, no matter how outrageous. So the Mexican asks for a ticket to Houston-for a second opinion.\n\nHouston's impressive medical facilities have long been a global hub for medical tourism, especially from neighboring Mexico, drawing patients in need of cancer treatment, heart surgery, and other necessary treatments. Mexicans with means (from the expanding middle class to billionaire families) also often head northward for shopping, entertainment, and investment.\n\nSo it is not surprising that with their own federal government failing to contain the virus or provide vaccines in a timely manner, even as the country has one of the highest COVID-19 fatality rates in the world and ranks third in total number of deaths, Mexican elites are once again looking north for their safety net. But it's one thing to fly into Houston to pay top dollar for cancer treatment at MD Anderson (and be welcomed for all your other spending that will benefit the Texan economy). It's quite another to fly in to vie for a free vaccine that is currently in limited supply.\n\nThere is little that is fair about the global race for the COVID-19 vaccine, despite international attempts to avoid the current disparities. In Israel, a country of 9 million people, half of the population has received at least one dose, while plenty of countries have yet to receive any. While the U.S. could vaccinate 70 percent of its population by September 2021 at the current rollout rate , it could take Mexico until approximately the year 2024 to achieve the same results. These inequities in vaccine access have made the United States a prime destination for vaccine tourism. The phenomenon takes place within the country as well: Disparate vaccine strategies in different states have led many to travel across state lines for a shot. Inequities in vaccine access occur on a local and global scale: Considerably fewer Black Americans have been vaccinated than whites even though people of color die of COVID-19 at almost three times the rate. The same goes for Mexico, where research shows low-income neighborhoods in Mexico City have been harder hit by the pandemic.\n\nThe federal government struck deals with international pharmaceutical companies early on, but doses haven't materialized according to plan. Mexico was the first country in Latin America to launch vaccinations starting with health care workers. The rollout slowed down after Pfizer announced delays and stopped sending the shots in mid-January. The setback in vaccine supply means Mexico has only vaccinated less than 2 percent of its population of roughly 126 million.\n\nBut Mexico scrambled to secure other deals and recently approved the emergency use of Russia's vaccine, Sputnik V, and China's CanSino and Sinovac vaccines to continue inoculation of people over 60. Once the government announced the website's URL for vaccine registration, the site immediately crashed under the weight of nearly 70,000 visits per second. The rollout to inoculate the elderly in Mexico kicked off on Feb. 15 in marginalized, impoverished areas according to the government's national vaccination plan. While the rollout has picked up speed recently, doses are still an uncertain possibility for those who qualify for the shot. Some critics are even calling the rollout arbitrary .\n\nWith the line moving slowly, frustrated Mexican elites are looking north. It's not surprising in one of the world's most unequal countries. The top 1 percent holds 43 percent of the nation's wealth, and 61.1 million people live below the nation's poverty line .\n\nSan Pedro Garza García, a municipality within the sprawling metropolis of Monterrey, is one of Mexico's wealthiest enclaves. As soon as the U.S. rolled out the COVID vaccines, many residents of San Pedro saw a window of opportunity. WhatsApp groups, social media, and news outlets have been inundated with gossip mixed in with news of people flying to Texas to get the shot. Many were people with businesses in Houston or San Antonio, beach houses in South Padre Island, or properties along the border; some had blue passports or residence permits. All of them had the resources to take the plunge.\n\n\"Claudia\" is a 58-year-old resident of San Pedro who'd rather not share her real name with me to discuss the vaccine issue. She tells me that for a while it has been the topic of conversation among her circles. People share stories, rumors, tips, and encouragement about the quest for vaccines. She recognizes that vaccine tourism holds a degree of stigma, as seen when celebrities and politicians have posted about getting the vaccine. Mexican TV host Juan José Origel , who posted on social media about receiving the shot in Miami, was criticized on both sides of the border and became the subject of heated public debate. A candidate for mayor of San Pedro also generated controversy after announcing he got the shot in Fresno, California, and calling on his local officials to step up. (He claimed he was only curious to see how the rollout worked, and once there seized the opportunity.) The state's health minister called vaccine tourism among the elites a matter of survival and encouraged it, while advising people to be aware of U.S. regulations.\n\nClaudia flew with her mother and sister, both over 65 years old, to San Antonio recently to try their luck at getting the shot. They succeeded after waiting in a line of cars for about 12 hours near the coastal town of Corpus Christi, where her mother has an apartment. They did not have to prove residency, but because they have property there, they could have if asked.\n\n\"We didn't do anything against the rules. We didn't lie about where we worked, our ages, or our health,\" Claudia told me over the phone from her mother's apartment. But she admits that she is uncomfortable about the fact that she got the vaccine before someone of her age and health was officially eligible. She is aware the shot could have gone to someone else who needed it more.\n\nVaccine tourism has already resulted in public policy shifts that could affect the most vulnerable. After Florida received thousands of out-of-state residents and foreign travelers because of its open registration system allowing anyone older than 65, the state changed course and implemented new rules that require people to show proof of residence.\n\nIf such a backlash to vaccine tourism went national, with states requiring-or just talking about the possibility of requiring-an official state ID or proof of residence, many of the 10.5 million undocumented immigrants across the U.S. could be discouraged from seeking the vaccine. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts went as far as saying undocumented workers would be excluded from the vaccine plan, though he eventually walked back that statement. The Department of Homeland Security said it \"encourages all individuals, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible under local distribution guidelines.\" The Mexican government also said it would make sure Mexican undocumented workers are included in the rollout by calling upon labor laws under the free trade agreement between the two countries.\n\nCarolina Viera, 34, always knew she would get the COVID-19 shot in the U.S. once it became available, no matter the price. She didn't trust the Mexican government's capacity to carry out a national vaccination plan, and as a dual citizen who has spent her entire life on the Mexican side of the border, she had options. At the end of January, Viera spent a week refreshing a score of vaccine registration sites in San Antonio, Laredo, and McAllen, Texas, to try to register her parents, both Mexican citizens only. She wasn't holding her breath after days slipped by and slots filled up in a matter of seconds. But then she got lucky. Viera and her elderly parents all got vaccinated on Feb. 1. \"If you have an open appointment system, I don't think it's fair to turn people away,\" she said over the phone from Monterrey.\n\nOne Texas state senator, Borris Miles, said in an interview with a Houston TV station that there is no excuse for vaccine tourism: \"It's wrong. It shouldn't happen. ... We can't let our tax dollars go to their parts of the globe.\" However, vaccine tourism also brings money into the U.S. Mexicans traveling to Texas for the vaccine contribute to the local economy, same as they do when they come for other medical treatment. They shop, go out to eat, rent cars, pay for hotel nights-and plenty of taxes on all of the above. The practice of medical tourism precedes the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's only natural that it will continue in a global crisis. But it's not that simple; ethics, nationalism, and diplomacy throw this phenomenon into murky territory.\n\nThere have been global efforts to counteract inequalities in vaccine access like COVAX, an initiative led in part by the World Health Organization. It is one of the biggest international efforts to ensure that middle- and low-income countries have equal and fair access to the vaccine, asking wealthy countries to invest in vaccine development for all in exchange for doses for them as well. The U.S. under the Trump administration decided not to participate, and the move by wealthy countries to buy enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over is so far undermining the initiative's goal. A study by the Economist Intelligence Unit revealed that middle-income and low-income countries could take until 2024 to achieve mass immunization. Meanwhile, high-income countries continue to look after their own by making pre-purchase deals with pharma companies before the vaccines hit the market. The European Union is also looking to create an \"export transparency mechanism\" to ensure its right of first refusal on any vaccine manufactured within its boundaries to guarantee supply to the bloc.\n\nMarroquin, the pilot, believes vaccine tourism is not about ethical or moral conundrums, but political shortcomings. He holds his government accountable for its deadly mishandling of the pandemic and argues that Mexicans will cross borders as a means of self-preservation even if vaccine tourism is not the solution for Mexico.\n\n\"Americans are doing the right thing by vaccinating as many people as possible,\" he said, and if that includes Mexicans, so much the better.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

That's according to a federal complaint , filed in February and unsealed last week, brought by two workers employed by a contractor to provide security at wall construction sites along the border. The workers also accused the company they were employed by, Sullivan Land Services Co., and a subcontractor, Ultimate Concrete of El Paso, of myriad misdeeds, including hiring unauthorized workers and overcharging the U.S. government.\n\nThe most jaw-dropping charge in the whistleblower complaint, however, is that Ultimate Concrete not only smuggled armed Mexican security personnel over the border to provide protection, but the company \"went so far as to build a dirt road to expedite illegal border crossings to sites in San Diego, using construction vehicles to block security cameras,\" the New York Times reported . \"An unnamed supervisor at the Army Corps of Engineers approved the operation.\"\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nOne of the whistleblowers is a former deputy sheriff in San Diego County, and the other a former FBI special agent who had been deployed on the border for wall construction security. \"One of the guards, who served as an on-site security manager for the contractors, told special agents with the F.B.I. that he had discovered through monthly audits of workers at the site in San Diego that many of the personnel working on construction and security were not vetted or approved by Customs and Border Protection,\" according to the Times. \"[Sullivan Land Services Co.], a primary builder of Mr. Trump's wall, has been awarded contracts worth more than $1.4 billion for work on multiple parts of the border. With those funds, the company is said to have allowed its subcontractor, Ultimate Concrete, to hire armed Mexicans and facilitate illegal border crossings that the president has worked to shut down.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

The number, in fact, was less than half of that. But around 4,000 people still gathered to hear the real estate mogul, reality star, and presidential contender spout xenophobic words. \"I love the Mexican people ... I respect Mexico ... but the problem we have is that their leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders, and they're killing us at the border,\" said Trump, according to Politico . \"They're taking our jobs. They're taking our manufacturing jobs. They're taking our money. They're killing us.\"\n\nNo one should interpret his words as anti-immigrant, Trump insisted, noting he's a fan of those who enter the country legally. \"They flow in like water, and I love legal immigration. I love it,\" he said. \"We should make it easier, and faster.\"\n\nEver the showman, Trump made fun of his rivals for the White House and mocked the companies that have cut ties with him over his recent comments. \"Thousands and thousands of people are cutting up their Macy's credit card. I love it,\" he said. Trump also called Hillary Clinton \"the worst secretary of State in the history of our country.\" He also expressed surprise at a poll that showed him tied with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush for the Republican vote. \"How could I be tied with this guy? He's terrible!\" Trump said.\n\nWhat qualifies Trump to be president? \"I'm really smart,\" he said. In fact, he's so smart that as soon as he were to move in to the White House he could solve problems in no time at all. Reuters summarizes:\n\nHe told the crowd he would be able to get hostages returned \"in an hour\" and would tax Mexico each time someone crossed the border illegally. He said he could convince the head of Ford Motor Co to move a plant back to the United States from Mexico overnight, with a couple of phone calls.\n\n\"It's so simple,\" he said.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the speech a group of protesters interrupted the real estate mogul but were immediately drowned out by supporters shouting \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\" reports the Arizona Republic . \"I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here. I think so,\" Trump said. \"Don't worry, we'll take out country back.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Law That Villainized Mexican Immigrants\n\nTrying to stem the tide: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump talks to the media after exiting his plane during his trip to the border on July 23, 2015, in Laredo, Texas.\n\nPhoto by Matthew Busch/Getty Images\n\nAs Fox News debate moderators reminded America last week, Donald Trump believes that \" the Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people \"-including drug dealers and rapists, who are \" doing the raping \"-into the United States as illegal immigrants. Trump nonetheless wants to make clear that he has no problem with legal immigration. \"Many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it,\" Trump wrote in a July statement. \"But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally.\" Almost all conservative politicians who believe illegal immigration is a problem make the same distinction: Ted Cruz's website, for example, says the senator \" celebrates legal immigration ,\" while Marco Rubio used a debate answer to praise the patience of immigrants who wait their turn for a visa . Trump said during the debate that he wants to build a wall on the border but would include \"a big beautiful door in that wall\" for legal entry.\n\nIt wasn't always this way. Fifty years ago a substantial number of conservative United States senators openly supported severe restrictions on legal immigration, influencing a bill that helped create the modern Mexican \"illegal\" immigration \"crisis\" as we know it.\n\nIn 1965, President Johnson backed a reform proposal called the Hart-Celler Act (aka the Immigration and Nationality Act), which proposed to eradicate the \"national origins\" immigration quotas that had been in place since the 1920s. Those quotas prohibited vast non-white portions of the world population (e.g. almost all Africans and Asians) from immigrating to the U.S. while restricting the number of visas allotted to European countries, like Italy and Poland, whose natives were considered ethnically inferior to those from England, Scandinavia, and the like. Under the new system proposed by Hart-Celler, every country outside the Western Hemisphere would have the same basic quota of 20,000 visas. Legal immigration from the Western Hemisphere (i.e., North, Central, and South America) was to remain uncapped-as it had always been, even during the height of the 1920s anti-immigration movement, out of diplomatic respect for our nearby neighbors and because a treaty related to the military takeover of the Southwest had already declared that ex-Mexicans were eligible for citizenship.\n\nBut some conservative senators were skeptical about altering the \"national origins\" system. They argued, as South Carolina Republican Strom Thurmond did, that the imperative \"to preserve one's identity and the identity of one's nation\" justified restrictionist policies that favored Western Europeans because they could more easily assimilate into the existing (white) culture. These opponents furthermore added that uncapped Western Hemisphere immigration was itself a looming threat to the United States' identity and stability. \"The day is not far off when the population explosion in Latin American countries will exert great pressures upon those people to emigrate to the United States,\" said West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd.\n\nOne of the hesitant Southerners was the influential Sam Ervin of North Carolina, a Democrat who led subcommittee hearings on the bill. (The debate over Hart-Celler was taking place before most of the South's racially conservative Democrats defected to the Republican Party -Thurmond himself had just switched a year before.) To win the support of Ervin and Illinois' Everett Dirksen, another key conservative vote, the Johnson administration agreed to a basic annual cap of 120,000 on total Western Hemisphere immigrants . The bill soon passed the Senate 76-18 . In 1976 a further restriction was enacted that limited each Western Hemisphere country to basic caps of 20,000. The country most affected by the new Western Hemisphere rules: Mexico.\n\nUntil it became a bargaining chip between LBJ and the Senate, the U.S.'s southern neighbor had played almost no part in the discussion of Hart-Celler or in the decade-plus immigration-reform movement that had preceded it. In her book Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America , Columbia University historian Mae Ngai notes that John F. Kennedy's pro-reform history A Nation of Immigrants , first published in 1958, \"devoted all of two paragraphs to Asian and Latino immigration.\" And a 900-page 1950 Senate report about pressing immigration issues didn't mention illegal Mexican immigration at all.\n\nThe lack of national interest in Mexico did not necessarily reflect a lack of activity at the border, as Ngai documents in her book. In the decades before Hart-Celler was passed, as many as 450,000 Mexicans had been legally entering the United States each year using temporary work permits issued by the \"bracero\" program, which supplied a migrant workforce for farms in California, Texas, and elsewhere. On top of that huge influx, some 50,000 Mexicans annually entered the U.S. as permanent residents. Conditions were still far from ideal for Mexicans from a civil rights perspective: Farm employers often didn't live up to the terms of their contracts, underpaying bracero workers and housing them in grim conditions, while even legal Mexican-American citizens were subject to discrimination, segregation, and hostility. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of so-called \"wetbacks\" did enter the country illegally (often because of promised jobs) and were subject to raids and deportations. But the significant majority of Mexicans who came into the country did so under legal auspices.\n\nAll that changed when, within a matter of a year, the bracero program was terminated and Hart-Celler's Western Hemisphere immigration cap passed. The end of the bracero program was actually supposed to be a liberal reform that put an end to the systemic exploitation of Mexican workers. But once Hart-Celler went through, there were less than half as many visa slots allotted to the entire hemisphere as had been received in some previous years by Mexican migrants alone. (Liberal reformers do deserve some blame here, it should be said, for helping eliminate the temporary bracero visas and then immediately acceding to a compromise that drastically reduced the number of other legal options for entry.)\n\nYou likely already know what has happened in the half-century since Hart-Celler. Jobs for immigrants didn't disappear and in fact opened up in a number of industries besides agriculture. The Mexican workers who wanted those jobs didn't stop coming. (Princeton sociologist Doug Massey and his collaborators have found that \"initiation of undocumented migration from Mexico is driven primarily by the pull of U.S. labor demand.\") They simply arrived without immigration papers and instead of moving back and forth between Mexico and the U.S. as they often had in the days before strenuous border control, they began to settle here. (Roughly 50 percent of Mexicans making their first undocumented trip to the U.S. in 1970 returned to Mexico within a year. By 2005 that number was approximately 10 percent.) The \"illegal\" immigrant population, of which Mexicans make up more than half, rose steadily and peaked at an estimated 12.2 million in 2007. (One of the multiple ironies of Donald Trump's hysterical position on immigration is that because of deportation and emigration, the number of undocumented individuals residing in the U.S. has actually been falling for several years.)\n\nPolitically, meanwhile, the same kinds of Mexican immigrants who'd been participating in legal migration for years became targets of criticism, villainized for supposedly disrespecting American laws and mooching off the American social safety net. Conservative rhetoric on immigration now treats our legal quotas on Mexican immigration-which were created more or less arbitrarily, without regard to the labor demand being created by our economy-as sacrosanct limits that deserve Mexicans' respect. But those legal limits were put forth in the first place to accommodate conservative senators who wanted to make it more difficult for Mexicans to move to the United States legally. If only all these Latino immigrants were legal, modern conservatives say, we'd be fine with them. Had it not been for Trump and Cruz and Rubio's predecessors, they might be.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Inspiring Mexicans to \"Imagine Amazing Things.\" In Space.\n\nThis story was originally published in Spanish by Letras Libres .\n\nAfter a depressing and divisive presidential campaign, Mexico is gripped with World Cup fever, and it's exhilarating. A stronger-than-expected first-round performance has Mexicans embracing our leading all-time scorer Javier Hernández's exhortation for us Mexicans to imagine \"amazing things\" (a sanitized translation of what he actually said).\n\n\"Chicharito\" Hernández is onto something well beyond the playing fields of Russia. It would be great if Mexico won the World Cup, of course, but his call to imagine amazing things for our country is equally salient in other contexts. Too often, countries like Mexico talk themselves out of great ambitions, instead ceding them to the usual suspects among countries, those that we've been conditioned to assume are the ones that accomplish great things.\n\nTake outer space, for instance. Why shouldn't countries like Mexico explore space alongside the superpowers? Indeed, why shouldn't Mexican citizens participate in this adventure, instead of just ceding it entirely to our government, which then cedes it to the superpowers?\n\nThese were some of my thoughts back in October of 2010, as I was fast approaching my 50 th birthday. Thinking about the milestone, I thought about how the future wasn't what I thought it would be. As a child, I had dreamed we would be living on the moon by now. We would all have a spaceship, and I, on a whim, would be able to buy myself a robot girlfriend. Stanley Kubrick and Blade Runner told me so.\n\nInstead, I pondered the cliché of every man's midlife crisis: Should I honor my half-century on Earth by buying a convertible or by building my own satellite to launch into space?\n\nIt turns out, you can't just wake up one Wednesday morning in Mexico City and rocket an object into low-Earth orbit. It requires some research, some exploration. I began my quest for knowledge at a place I knew would not fail me: Sanborns.\n\nMy father was a fan of Sanborns, the Mexican department store chain/restaurant/pharmacy/bakery/bookstore/optician's shop, and each Sunday of his life he would bring my brother and I there to eat the famous \"enchiladas suizas.\" In my adulthood, I found Sanborns was a good place for drinking coffee and buying magazines. There, in a copy of Scientific American, I found an article titled \"Citizen Satellites: Sending Experiments Into Orbit Affordably,\" a six-page description of how to make small satellites. What was once an idea became a possibility. We would call the satellite Ulises (the Spanish for \"Ulysses\"), the most fitting name for an infinite traveler forever seeking to get to its Penelope. Such a name also paid tribute to Ulises Carrión, a Mexican contemporary artist, and offered a wink to James Joyce's modernist masterpiece.\n\nI decided the satellite should be a work of art. It also seemed wise that, if Mexico would be producing a satellite, that it would be produced by a collaboration of people, which I would name the Colectivo Espacial Mexicano (Mexican Space Collective). The plan seemed sensible. So I started making phone calls. \"Hello, my name is Juan and I want to launch a satellite to space .\"\n\nIt became like the overture of a special opera in my mind, with Wagner himself at my side whispering, \"Keep composing .\" Just as opera is a hybrid of music and theater, the creation of Ulises would be a 21 st -century hybrid of art and science. It progressed with my attempts to buy, from China, the distinct elements needed to build a satellite. Unfortunately, the aria abruptly halted: I didn't get far before my credit card was frozen.\n\nI called Visa, and a representative told me they had suspended my card for \"suspicious activity.\" \"Suspicious activity,\" I found, meant that you shouldn't be buying satellite components if you're from an art collective in a third-world country.\n\nEffectively, if you're in Mexico City and start to order pieces for a satellite, an algorithm detects that that shouldn't happen. Even after I sorted out my card, I soon learned that I would have to apply for special permission from the U.S. Department of Defense in order to see the project out. Unbelievable: I had to submit a mission manifest to them. Unbelievable: I had to take an official oath, swearing that \"I won't export my payload to an enemy of the United States.\" (The payload I had planned on launching? Poetry.) Because of the bureaucracy, it took three months to import the same kind of $1 solar cell you can find in many imported toys.\n\nAs I continued the project, I decided to visit Gerard Auvray, a French slalom champion and telephone engineer known for making low-Earth orbit satellites from the attic of his Paris home. It was one of the most magical moments of my life, entering a house to find cats and satellites everywhere I looked.\n\nWe went up to his attic laboratory, where my eyes wandered around to see a desk, some bookcases, a microscope, a big magnifying glass, some welding guns, and an oscilloscope. Stacked in a corner was a baby-blue box with \"SPUTNIK\" written on the lid. The Russian government had commissioned Auvray to make replicas of that first artificial satellite. Soon, I found myself standing beside him, my hands on a copy of the aluminum \"basketball\" that had changed the world-the symbol that ignited the Cold War-era Space Race. To paraphrase Marshall McLuhan, when Sputnik went around the planet in 1957, the world changed, and the planet itself became an art form.\n\nI wanted Ulises to be a kind of Mexican Sputnik, a vehicle for the imagination (sans Cold War politics, of course). Though Mexico may not have the reputation of a technological superpower in the way that Russia, the U.S., India, or China may have, our citizen collective, too, can claim a place on the extraplanetary stage.\n\nBy 2011, our group of artists, researchers, scientists, lawyers, and others gathered at an exhibition to officially launch the Colectivo Espacial Mexicano. Since then, our project has only become more real. We launched our first satellite, Ulises I, on Dec. 4, 2015 , and followed with Ulises II one week later. (Disclosure: The Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University served as a publication partner for a book about the Colectivo Espacial Mexicano and the launch of Ulises I. Future Tense is a partnership between Slate, Arizona State University, and New America.) We established a \"School of Satellites\" in Mexico City to teach people how to build them. And we've taken on other projects: making even more satellites, producing a zero gravity poem, and sending transmissions to space. This includes a project we've dubbed the \"Quixote Moon Bounce,\" in which, as you can likely guess, we beam the story of Cervantes' hero out of this world (we think it makes for a fitting extraterrestrial message from mankind). Another development: We've also changed our name. We're now the Agencia Espacial Civil Mexicana (Mexican Civil Space Agency) and are looking ahead to doing more to promote international collaboration in the training of astronauts.\n\nChicharito Hernandez is right to say that Mexicans should imagine amazing things. Beyond the World Cup pitches, we may have to overcome the fact that the Mexico isn't he nation we were promised by our politicians. But, as I learned, the future is a DIY project. It starts with people deciding to imagine amazing things.\n\nPerhaps if Hernandez and the Mexican team win the World Cup, we'll launch another satellite: One that contains a video of the team's feat, for all the worlds to see.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Are Hispanics Joining the White Mainstream?\n\nPhoto by David McNew/Getty Images\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010 , Hispanics grew from 12.5 percent of the American population to 16.3 percent, a change of more than 30 percent. The Great Recession slowed migration from Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, but researchers still project a steady increase in the number of Hispanic residents. By 2050, predicts the Census Bureau , Hispanics will grow to 28 percent of the population, the largest portion of a \"majority-minority\" America that includes blacks, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and mixed-race people.\n\nThe projection is sound, but- as I wrote last month -we should temper this prediction of a majority-minority future with an awareness of race and shifting identity. As a category, \"Hispanic\" includes a range of ethnic and racial backgrounds, from Afro-Brazilians and brown-skinned Puerto Ricans to indigenous Mexicans and Argentinians of largely European descent.\n\nAssimilation, intermarriage, and upward mobility might lead some Hispanics to identify as \"white,\" even as they hold to their cultural heritage. And in the same way, society may reciprocate, treating light-skinned, European Hispanics as ethnic whites, akin to Italians and Eastern Europeans. Which would fit the American pattern.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Italians were considered a separate race of people, distinct from Anglo-Americans in the nation's racial taxonomy. And fear of their presence sparked violence, discrimination, and strict anti-immigration laws. With time, mobility, and the shared experience of depression and war, however, those Italians began to see themselves as white and mainstream, and in turn, white Americans agreed.\n\nIn fact, new research says that's happening right now . According to data presented at an annual meeting of the Population Association of America, an estimated 1.2 million Americans changed their racial and ethnic identification from \"Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin\" on the 2000 census to \"white\" on the one in 2010. Here's the Pew Research Center with more:\n\nThe largest number of those who changed their race/ethnicity category were 2.5 million Americans who said they were Hispanic and \"some other race\" in 2000, but a decade later, told the census they were Hispanic and white, preliminary data showed. Another 1.3 million people made the switch in the other direction. Other large groups of category-changers were more than a million Americans who switched from non-Hispanic white to Hispanic white, or the other way around.\n\nWhat's interesting is that this happened during a decade of rising anti-immigrant sentiment, draconian anti-immigrant laws, and a rising pan-Latino identity, which seem to stand as countervailing forces.\n\nTo be clear, as Nate Cohn notes for the New York Times , \"White identification is not necessarily a sign that Hispanics consider themselves white. Many or even most might identify their race as \"Hispanic\" if it were an explicit option.\" At the same time, this change reflects growing assimilation among a group of Hispanics, who-as Cohn writes-\"are likelier to be second- and third-generation Hispanics than foreign-born and noncitizen Hispanics\" and have higher incomes and more education.\n\nIntermarriage will of course play a role in shaping identity. Already, intermarriage is most common among whites and Hispanics. The children of those unions could see themselves as white and Hispanic, simply Hispanic, or simply white.\n\nIn any case, it's more than clear that some Hispanics are following the path of previous European immigrant groups, where success breeds assimilation, and assimilation brings whiteness.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How Trump Made a Fool out of Mexico\n\nDaniel Cardenas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThis article is part of a series published in cooperation with the Mexican magazine Letras Libres .\n\nIt was a theatrical work with two simultaneous performances. One was staged against the scenery of the American campaign for president; the other unfolded within the Mexican political arena. There were two actors: candidate Donald Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto. Trump was trying to soften his image with undecided American voters and perhaps persuade some Latino Americans to support him, to see him as presidential and friendly toward Mexicans, all without alienating his committed followers and all while not yielding an inch on his wall and deportation agenda. Peña Nieto, more unpopular in his country than Trump is in his, was trying to \" protect \" Mexicans in Mexico itself and in the United States. There was only one winner, Donald Trump, and one loser, Peña Nieto. Or, more precisely, Peña Nieto and the people of Mexico.\n\nTrump calls himself a great negotiator. On this particular occasion, he was. He chose the moment, the script, the terminology, even the questions. And, as usual, falsehood and fakery were his weapons. He spent 10 hours with Mexico (including his flight time) and secured the appearance of support from the country's president (not explicit but, for Trump, usefully symbolic). Having fitted himself for a halo as a friend of Mexico, Trump could then return to euphorically address his faithful supporters in Arizona, reiterating word for word his racist and anti-immigrant proposals, beginning with the construction of \" a big, fat, beautiful wall \" that Mexico will pay for . After all, hadn't he just shaken hands, that very afternoon, with his \" friend ,\" the president of Mexico?\n\nPeña Nieto, onstage with Trump, delivered a sober speech about commerce and emigration, a factual discourse that neither convinced nor made a minimal emotional impression on Trump, who is a post-factual politician. For him, objective truth does not exist. Truth for him is whatever he happens to be saying at that particular moment.\n\nPeña Nieto should have demanded a public apology for Trump's insults against Mexico and Mexicans, for his repeatedly characterizing us as rapists and criminals. Not only did the elected president of Mexico fail to do so, but he referred to Trump's ignorant allegations as \" misunderstandings \" due to differences of \"perception.\"\n\nPeña Nieto should have publicly expressed his absolute refusal to pay for Trump's absurd wall. In a tweet after the fact-fortunately picked up by the American press -Peña Nieto stated that he had, at the beginning of Trump's visit, told him in private that Mexico would never pay for a wall. (A revelation of yet another one of Trump's endless lies, since he claimed in their joint appearance afterward that there had been no discussion at all of how his pet wall would be financed.) But why did the Mexican president not bravely affirm his position in public?\n\nAnd why did he agree to this meeting at all, on the day before the presidential informe (a state-of-the country address), delivered on Sept. 1 , a key date in Mexico going back to 1917. Why did he have to schedule this meeting in the afternoon preceding Trump's anti-immigrant tirade in Arizona? We Mexicans are raised to value a kind of public courtesy, often pro forma and sometimes florid, surely the genesis of a statement like Peña Nieto's calling Trump a friend. Did he really think that traditional (in this case banal) Mexican courtesy would soften Trump's message directed at the most bigoted of his supporters?\n\nTrump came to Mexico to offer some supposedly laudatory words about we Mexicans whom he has spent his whole campaign insulting. Now we were \" tremendous people .\" And in exchange for these miserable crumbs of vacuous content, he was given a presidential treatment, incidentally alienating Hillary Clinton, a candidate who does understand and respect Mexico, who in her phrase wants to build bridges not walls (and whose husband literally saved Mexico from bankruptcy in 1995).\n\nDonald Trump is a sociopath drunk on himself. His religion is hatred. His god is Donald Trump. He is also addicted to empty adjectives. He is not a man of his word or of words as markers of truth. If he wins the presidency (which seems improbable), the Mexican government will have to weigh the dimensions of this historic error, widely denounced in Mexico all across the political spectrum. From Trump, Mexico received only words, words worth no more than the paper they were scribbled on. In exchange, Mexico, filling the sad role of the useful idiot, gave a bigot the pat on the back that he required.\n\nTranslated by Hank Heifetz\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Warning Signs in Mexico\n\nWhen more than 56 million Mexicans went to the polls to elect a new president and a new Congress on July 1, 2018, it was clear they were ready for a change. The outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto, was deeply unpopular, with an approval rating below 20 percent. His administration and his party, the PRI, were mired in corruption scandals and blamed for the disappearance of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero. Cartel violence was astronomically high, which many blamed on the failed war on drugs started by the previous president, Felipe Calderón of the PAN party, in 2006. Mexicans were fed up with the cronyism and excesses of the country's political and business elites and worn out by the shocking number of violent deaths in the country-more than 250,000 since 2006, according to government statistics.\n\nThe PAN and the PRI were perceived as part of the same rotten political establishment that ruled the country since the end of the Mexican revolution, and voters were tired of both of them. Fifty-three percent of the electorate voted for the left-wing candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City and founder of the National Regeneration Movement party, or MORENA, who promised a historic transformation of Mexican institutions and society. López Obrador, often referred to by his initials, AMLO, won the presidency and MORENA's coalition secured a majority in both houses of government.\n\nAMLO ran on a populist platform that blamed most of Mexico's problems on the upper class and the neoliberal economic policies that were implemented in Mexico from the 1980s onward. He presented himself as a man of the people and traveled to the most remote districts of the country to make his case. His messianic rhetoric and demagogic policy ideas drew comparisons to Hugo Chávez and the worst of the Latin American left, but for most Mexicans he fostered hope, not fear.\n\nIn his first three months in office, AMLO has made a series of decisions that outline a policy agenda and a vision for the future that should worry all Mexicans. Though the president diagnosed many of the country's problems correctly-inequality, corruption, and violent crime, to name a few-the way he is tackling these issues suggests he sees the world through a lens of anachronistic nationalism, built on a flawed understanding of history and economics.\n\nThe first major decision AMLO made after winning the election, before even taking office, was to cancel the construction of a much-needed new airport in Mexico City, in an area called Texcoco. After a sham referendum organized by his own party, in which only 1 percent of the population voted, he pulled the plug on the $13 billion project and announced that an air force base called Santa Lucía, 28 miles from the existing airport, will be conditioned to function as a supplementary airport instead.\n\n\"What the government is saying is that this was a very expensive project and that with the other project they will save around 100 billion pesos [roughly $5 billion],\" said Mario Ruiz, the former chief of staff of the Texcoco airport project. \"Their argument was that we were building a very ostentatious airport for a poor country. What I would tell you is that that is a false premise; what they're doing right now is going to have a much higher cost for the country.\"\n\nOne-third of the Texcoco airport was already built, so the cancellation of the project resulted in an immediate loss of roughly $5 billion that had already been spent plus another $4 billion in debts to investors. Additionally, there is a consensus among aviation experts that the Santa Lucía project is unfeasible because the landing routes cross paths with the current airport's. \"The Santa Lucía project is a very short-term solution to the problem [of saturation at the current airport],\" said Ruiz. \"In 10 years, we're going to be talking about where to build a new airport again.\"\n\nIn January, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its forecast for Mexican economic growth in 2019 from 2 percent to 1 percent, citing a possible downturn in the U.S. economy and uncertainty around Mexico's new economic policies and the cancellation of the airport in Texcoco, which scared investors.\n\nThere was undoubtedly a political component to the cancellation of the airport-it sent a strong message that AMLO is in charge, and it pandered to his base, which saw the Texcoco project as a symbol of corruption and upper-class extravagance. But it was clearly also motivated by AMLO's inward-looking, anti-neoliberal ideology.\n\n\"If you read López Obrador's book from before the campaign, La Salida ( The Exit ), the narrative is that this country was doing well until 1982, when president [Miguel] de La Madrid came to power, the neoliberal era began, and Mexico went downhill,\" said Leo Zuckerman, the host of Es la Hora de Opinar , a Mexican political debate show. \"It is, of course, a Manichean and simplistic vision that does not correspond with reality.\"\n\nThe Mexican economy prior to the 1980s was characterized by the government's protectionist policies and the nationalization of several major industries, like oil, electricity, and telecommunications. \"If you look at Mexico in the '70s and at Mexico last year, there is not a single measure by which Mexico was doing better before,\" said Jorge Suárez-Vélez, a prominent columnist for the Mexican daily Reforma. \"As a result of opening up the economy, Mexico has created a large middle class over the last 30 years.\"\n\nNeoliberal policies made Mexico richer, but it's true that, like everywhere else in the world, they also increased inequality. AMLO vowed not to raise taxes and to end the year with a fiscal surplus while delivering on his campaign promise to redistribute wealth through social programs-he doubled pensions for everyone over 68, is offering yearlong job-training scholarships to everyone between 18 and 29 that does not work or go to school, and started a pension program for people with disabilities.\n\n\"To finance all of that, it is necessary for the economy to keep growing and for the state to be able to collect more taxes,\" said Zuckerman. \"If the economy isn't doing well, they're not going to have the resources to distribute to their constituents, and that's going to create a problem, unless they start getting into a lot of debt, but that would make the economic problem even worse.\"\n\nAMLO's economic policies are often reminiscent of another era. They include price controls on basic goods and rescuing Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company (whose $106 billion debt was recently downgraded by Fitch), with tax cuts and bailouts. \"The airport, the price controls, all the measures around Pemex and public expenditure-the criteria for making these economic decisions is clearly of an ideological nature,\" said Jorge Castañeda, Mexico's foreign minister from 2000 to 2003 and a professor of Latin American studies at New York University.\n\nAMLO campaigned on rescuing Pemex, the most indebted oil company in the world, in order to increase gasoline production in Mexico and end Mexico's dependence on gasoline imports from the U.S. In January, AMLO announced the shutdown of key oil pipelines to combat rampant oil theft, a practice known as huachicoleo , which is controlled by organized crime and generates losses for Pemex of more than $3 billion a year. The shutdown of the pipeline led to widespread fuel shortages across central Mexico, one of the most productive regions of the country. To this day, no arrests in the fight against huachicoleo have been announced, and it is not clear how shutting down the pipelines will provide a long-term solution to the problem.\n\nPemex is a behemoth whose production has been plummeting for years. Its proven reserves are drying up, and it can't produce enough light oil for its own refineries. Pemex doesn't have the capital nor the technology to explore and drill new reserves, and with alternative energy sources becoming increasingly inexpensive, it is hard to understand how pinning the future of Mexico's energy sector on self-sufficient oil production is a good idea. \"What we're seeing is total incompetence,\" said Suárez-Vélez. \"They're managing the biggest company in the country with ideological criteria.\"\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , AMLO reduced gasoline imports from the U.S. in December and has completely stopped importing U.S. light crude oil, which Mexican refineries use to make gasoline. This likely aggravated the gasoline shortages and has led some to believe that the clumsy battle against huachicoleo was an excuse to cover up shortages caused in part by the decision to reduce U.S. imports. \"If what you had wanted to do was fight huachicoleo , then you would have made sure your gasoline reserves were full, that you had enough trucks [to transport the gasoline to gas stations], and that you had a strategy,\" said Suárez-Vélez. \"You don't just shut down the pipeline and then realize you don't have gasoline and you don't have trucks.\"\n\nAnother cause for concern is that AMLO is leaning heavily on the military to advance his agenda. He has deployed the military in the fight against huachicoleo -soldiers are guarding pipelines and driving the recently purchased trucks for gasoline transport-and the military will be in charge of the construction of the Santa Lucía airport. The military will also develop luxury real estate for private purchase in order to finance a new national police force, called the Guardia Nacional . The Guardia Nacional will be under civilian command, but it will initially be comprised mostly of military and naval police officers. Under the constitutional amendment that allows for the creation of the Guardia Nacional , AMLO will have the authority to use the military for matters of public safety for the next five years.\n\n\"I look at militarization in this country with great concern,\" said Zuckerman. \"Historically, when you increase the role of the armed forces in society, it gets harder and harder to take them out-they don't like to lose power. ... In the specific case of Mexico, especially after the revolution, it took a lot of work to take the military out of political life, and now López Obrador is bringing it back.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, AMLO's popularity remains amazingly high, at around 80 percent. \"He connects very well with the most basic emotions in people,\" said Castañeda. \"Until we start to see the grave consequences [of his actions], he won't experience much rejection.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Distant Neighbors\n\nRead more about America's dysfunctional relationship with Mexico .\n\nThe other day, my 4-year-old son asked me what a border is. It was a simple question, and yet I found myself stammering until his eyes narrowed intently. He does that, as if to say, \"Aha, it seems I have stumbled upon something juicy here.\" He might as well have been asking where babies come from. In fact, I was merely struggling to figure out whether to emphasize that borders are shared, thus bonding either side, or whether to emphasize that borders separate and divide, creating sides in the first place.\n\nI have crossed it so many times. My life's been defined by the choice of which side of it I would end up on, and yet I still don't know quite what to make of la frontera . I showed Sebastian the U.S.-Mexico border on the map. We traced the straight eastward line from California-now diagonal, now horizontal-until it hits El Paso-Juárez, where all pretense of tidiness is surrendered to the vagaries of the Rio Grande and the integrity of the Texan republic.\n\nIt's befuddling on the ground, too, perhaps no place more so than in Nogales, a town-or towns, thanks to the fence crawling across the jagged, barren hills, one in Arizona, one in Sonora state-begging to be forever preceded by the adjective Godforsaken . No offense, but if you have been there, you know what I mean. The border there, unlike in Juárez or Tijuana, seems to slice through one compact community, almost violently. It's reminiscent of Berlin and its wall that way, and as in Berlin in its day, the severity of the line drawn in the sand (literally, in the case of Nogales) serves to reinforce that each side of the same community belongs to entirely different worlds. To walk across to the Mexican side, you go through an old-fashioned turnstile of the kind you might find at a stadium or on the New York City subway, and then you're out, gone, in a separate reality. As if to underscore the arbitrariness of life, Mexico welcomes you with a small, pedestrian-size traffic light. Press the button: green, you're good to go; red, open your bags.\n\n\"Poor Mexico,\" an old saying in that country goes, \"so close to the United States, so far from God.\" If Americans cared enough about Mexico to coin pithy sayings about the place, they might have an equally regretful formulation. The title of Alan Riding's book Distant Neighbors remains operative a quarter-century after it first appeared.\n\nThis week, Barack Obama is going to a Mexico that few Americans understand or appreciate. It is both remarkable and typical that neither the president nor anyone in his top tier of advisers, including his secretary of state, have shown much interest in our southern neighbor and its more than 100 million people or have much knowledge of them. A presidential trip to Burkina Faso would be only slightly more exotic to this crew.\n\nOn the Mexican side, of course, there is plenty of misunderstanding as well, but one borne not from neglect but from excessive rumination about the northern colossus. Mexican elites think they know the United States inside and out, but they invariably hold onto irreconcilable, overreaching stereotypes: As individuals, Americans are innocent, humorless, and bumbling, but in the aggregate, Americans somehow manage to form a ruthless, omnipotent hegemon.\n\nPartly because half of what used to be Mexico now lies north of the border, Mexicans underestimate the ability of the United States to bumble. Seeing the United States as a nearly infallible superpower suits Mexico's cultural fatalism and provides Mexicans with an all-convenient scapegoat for their daily travails. But Mexico's exaggerated sense of awe about its northern neighbor is as corrosive and distortive to the bilateral relationship as is the utter contempt with which Americans regard Mexico.\n\nOn immigration, for instance, Mexicans can't entertain the possibility that perhaps the United States is incapable of policing its border with microscopic precision. Hence, in the Mexican narrative, millions of Mexicans have crossed \"illegally\" because Washington wanted them to do so since they needed their labor, a view reinforced by the ease with which they get hired. The fact that prospective employees are made to cross a desert as part of the application process, and forced to live in the shadows subject to arbitrary deportation, is just a sign of anti-Mexican prejudice, which preceding waves of immigrants from places like Ireland and Germany would never have been subjected to.\n\nThe headline-grabbing violence surrounding the drug trade, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives in the last three years, also exacerbates a sense among Mexicans that their fate is determined north of the border. American demand for illicit drugs is the root cause of the problem, and the trafficking cartels are becoming an ever larger cancer thanks to the billions in profits and the thousands of weapons that flow back into Mexico.\n\nIf you're a Mexican invested in the narrative of an all-powerful American empire, it's hard not to take the current situation as a personal affront. The Obama administration and members of Congress might pat themselves on the back for offering Mexico a helicopter or two to help out, but south of the border there is a perception that if it wanted to, the United States could easily put an end to the northward flow of drugs and the southward flow of cash and guns. Beyond effective policing, how about repealing the Second Amendment and legalizing drugs to solve the problem? The fact that Mexicans can raise such questions in earnest shows what distant neighbors they really are.\n\nThe current financial crisis also feeds all sorts of misunderstandings and even conspiracy theories south of the border. How to square this financial crisis, a global contagion that for once was triggered by the United States and is wafting across the border from north to south, with the image of an all-powerful America? In Mexico, the thesis of American decline is not obvious. Surely there must be something else going on, and indeed the fact that it is the Mexican peso, not the American dollar, that has been devaluing-eating away at recent gains in Mexican living standards-seems an indication that when it comes to the coin toss of sharing a border with the United States, it's always going to be \"heads they win, tails we lose.\"\n\nDespite all the failures to communicate, the misunderstandings, the disparity of interest, and the mutual mistrust built into the U.S.-Mexico relationship, the fact is that both countries are fortunate to border each other. Ours is like a stale, neglected marriage whose inherent virtues and strengths are now best appreciated by others. Certainly in Europe, Africa, and Asia, the U.S.-Mexico partnership is perceived as a harmonious, mutually beneficial one. Nowhere else in the world do you find a 2,000-mile boundary between what used to be called the First and Third Worlds, and for all our petty dramas, it is remarkable that there is not more friction.\n\nFor all its fatalist paranoia, the proximity to the United States is a huge economic advantage for Mexico, and the country has only itself to blame if it hasn't fully exploited that fact. Moreover, the need to retain its own identity while in the shadows of the United States has enriched and deepened Mexico's own culture in ways that make it deeply admired around the world. The two economies, so integrated now, complement each other, and the United States has reaped tremendous benefits from sharing a border with a growing market for its goods, as well as by serving as a source of needed labor that can seamlessly integrate into the American work force. Other developed economies like Germany and Japan haven't enjoyed such an advantage, and their choices have been to airlift in workers who encounter and trigger far greater cultural tensions or to atrophy in the absence of such inflows.\n\nAmericans know so little about Mexico-at least about the parts between Tijuana and Cancún-because they have had the luxury of not paying attention. And we haven't been sufficiently appreciative of that luxury. Generations of Americans have had to learn about the geography and culture of Germany, Korea, Russia, Cuba, Vietnam, and Iraq-and not out of any intellectual curiosity. But Mexico, for all its flaws and contradictions, has been a largely sensible, peaceful partner that shares many of our nation's values and has thus earned itself our neglect. The loud nativist anti-immigration voices in this country like to portray Mexico as a hell on earth, but really, how many other developing nations with a population in excess of 100 million would we prefer to have as a southern neighbor?\n\nAsk Russians, Chinese, or Europeans whether we are fortunate in this respect. Americans quibble over how many Border Patrol guards should police its southern flank, and in the anxiety of the moment there is much talk of mobilizing the National Guard. But this in itself reflects the tremendous luxury geography has afforded the United States, which has never had to deploy vast standing armies to secure its land borders. Of how many other great powers in history can the same be said? I am guessing the answer is in the neighborhood of zero.\n\nSo, I still don't know quite what to make of la frontera -both the physical one and the notional one. We are fortunate to share it, if annoyingly unaware of that reality. I don't find the current bull market in concern over Mexico all that reassuring, because it is driven by an overwrought failed-state thesis peddled by the same anti-Mexican voices that scuttled comprehensive immigration reform. If portraying Mexico as another Pakistan is the only way we'll pay attention to our neighbor, then maybe I'll cast my ballot for continued neglect.\n\nWhat we have here is not a failed state so much as a failed relationship, one that both governments need to address in a sustained, responsible manner in the coming years.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Zoe Saldaña responds to criticism that 'Emilia Pérez' is 'hurtful' to Mexicans after Oscar win\n\nSaldaña won the best supporting actress Oscar for her performance in the film.\n\nZoe Saldaña responded to a reporter who had critiques of \"Emilia Pérez\" in the press room following her best supporting actress win at the 2025 Oscars .\n\nThe Mexican reporter set up their question by saying a lot has been said about trans people and empowering women, \"but less has been said about Mexico, which is the heart of it.\" The reporter asked Saldaña her thoughts on that, a topic they said was \"really hurtful for us Mexicans.\"\n\nSaldaña began by saying, \"First of all, I'm very, very sorry that you and so many Mexicans felt offended. That was never our intention. We spoke and came from a place of love, and I will stand by that.\"\n\n\"I don't share your opinion,\" Saldaña continued. \"For me, the heart of this movie was not Mexico. We weren't making a film about a country. We were making a film about four women. And these women could have been Russian. They could have been Dominican. They could have been Black from Detroit. Could have been from Israel. Could have been from Gaza. And these women are still very universal women that are struggling every day at trying to survive systemic oppression and trying to find their most authentic voices.\"\n\nSaldaña ended her response by saying, \"So I will stand by that, but I'm also always open to sit down with all of my Mexican brothers and sisters and with love and respect having a great conversation on how 'Emilia' could have been done better. I have no problem. I welcome it.\"\n\nSaldaña's response has received mixed reaction on social media, with some calling her response dismissive and disrespectful.\n\nHeading into awards season, \"Emilia Pérez\" was a juggernaut film.\n\nIt was nominated for 13 Academy Awards at the 2025 Oscars, ultimately winning just two: best supporting actress for Saldaña and best original song for \"El Mal,\" which Saldaña actually sang in the film.\n\nThe film has faced criticism for how it tackled its central themes -- including from LGBTQ critics over its trans representation, those who took offense to previous comments by the film's director Jacques Audiard about the Spanish language and how the film depicted Mexican cartels and their victims.\n\nIn recent weeks, star Karla Sofía Gascón also came under fire for past offensive social media posts.\n\nRead up about all the controversy surrounding \"Emilia Pérez\" here and check out a recap of the 2025 Oscars here .\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Mexican Americans seek atonement for ancestral lands that were taken over generations\n\n\"America owes us the opportunity to take care of our own communities.\"\n\nThis report is part of \"Turning Point,\" a groundbreaking series by ABC News examining the racial reckoning sweeping the United States and exploring whether it can lead to lasting reconciliation.\n\nIn some ways, what happened to Mexican Americans in the Southwest happened time and again throughout American history. Promises were made to the community, but many were never kept.\n\n\"I just don't think people get the passion that's attached to this,\" said Rita Padilla-Gutierrez, whose community has lost tens of thousands of acres of ancestral land over generations. \"It's the history, for God's sake. Plain and simple. Your language, your customs, your food, your traditions. But for us, it's being a land-based people.\"\n\nWhat we now consider the Southwest wasn't part of the United States at all 172 years ago -- it was the northernmost part of Mexico. In 1845, the U.S. annexed Texas, which Mexico considered part of its territory. This spurred a long and bloody war with Mexico and, ultimately, Mexico ceded half its country to the U.S.\n\nWatch the full story on \"Nightline\" TONIGHT at 12:05 a.m. ET on ABC\n\nThe agreement between the two countries was immortalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which gave around 100,000 Mexican nationals living in those territories citizenship if they decided to stay. More importantly, the agreement protected the rights of any Mexican whose land was now a part of the U.S.\n\n\"When Mexico negotiates the treaty in good faith, assuming that all of its citizens' rights will be respected, what it doesn't understand is that for the United States, only whites have the rights to full citizenship,\" said María Josefina Saldaña-Portillo, author of \"Indian Given: Racial Geographies Across Mexico and the United States.\" \"[Shortly after the treaty,] territorial governments systematically go about disenfranchising all Mexican citizens who they deem to not be white.\"\n\nIndeed, when the treaty was sent to Congress, the Senate removed the article that laid out the process by which the land would be protected.\n\nIn 1848, there were 154 communities in New Mexico to whom the U.S. government guaranteed land. But most of those agreements, or land grants, were never honored. Today, only 35 communities remain.\n\nWhile the country prospered, the treaty would forever change the fate of generations of Mexican Americans to come.\n\n\"There's a huge disparity here in terms of poverty and [in] terms of education,\" Arturo Archuleta, a land grant heir in New Mexico, told \"Nightline.\" \"These communities have been left behind.\"\n\nHeirs like Archuleta are working to get reparations for the land that was taken from their communities, which existed long before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was even created, according to Jacobo Baca, a historian with the University of New Mexico's Land Grant Studies Program.\n\n\"It's beyond [a] sense of place,\" Baca said. \"Our identity is tied to place, but we don't see that place having an identity without us, either. So it defines us just as much as we define it.\"\n\nAt the University of New Mexico, a collection of documents shows how a variety of land grants were vastly diminished over the years. One of the documents showed how an agreement for over 40,000 acres was reduced to less than 1,400 acres.\n\n\"I think for land grant heirs, there's this recognition that this treaty was a promise that was made that wasn't kept, and that the federal government owes the recognition of these communities,\" Baca said.\n\nArchuleta is an heir to the Manzano and the Tierra Amarilla land grants.\n\n\"We come from Spanish communities that came over, [and from] Native American communities as well,\" Archuleta said. \"So we really are sort of mestizo. We're mixed... We're a land-based people. Half of our soul was here before Columbus ever hit the sand.\"\n\nArchuleta says that these communities should be able to thrive where they are.\n\n\"It's not just surviving, but thriving. Our cultural connections are still in place,\" he said. \"The land grant and the treaty issues is probably what you consider the first Latino issue in this country, and it's still unresolved.\"\n\nPadilla-Gutierrez's family in New Mexico has also seen its land vanish over time. For centuries, she said the family has been living in the area near Tomé Hill in Valencia County. Now a hiking trail and site for religious pilgrims, its hillsides are filled with petroglyphs and its summit contains several large crosses.\n\n\"We have very deep, deep native roots here,\" Andrea Padilla, Padilla-Gutierrez's sister, told \"Nightline.\"\n\nPadilla-Gutierrez said their land used to encompass 123,000 acres but that it has since been reduced to only 400 acres.\n\n\"America owes us the opportunity to take care of our own communities,\" Padilla-Gutierrez said.\n\n\"I think regaining some of our land back would be justice,\" her sister added.\n\nThe family still has the patent it was given to honor the land grant.\n\n\"It's signed by Ulysses Grant, who was president at the time -- seal and everything -- granting us that our land grant will continue to be ours again,\" Padilla said. \"But then later, they stole our mountains.\"\n\nThe Tomé land grant lost 50,000 acres to the federal government in 1906. Like many others who held land grants, the family later had to sell their land.\n\n\"It hurt my father deeply, because he fought to the very end, telling people, 'You can't do this. ... Once you sell your land, that's it, you're nothing. You lose your culture. You lose everything,'\" Padilla said.\n\nHer sister says their family's land should've never been sold. The community lost more than acreage, she said. They \"lost their way of life.\"\n\nMexican American culture has been maligned for generations, and the racism born out of that continues to be espoused at the highest levels of government today.\n\nThe president himself famously kicked off his bid for office by saying Mexican immigrants are \"bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" And as recently as June, The White House suggested that travel from Mexico was contributing to COVID-19 infections rather than states' efforts to reopen their economies.\n\n\"It does hit me in the heart,\" Padilla said. \"We always worked hard... And we did the right thing. So when they talk about lazy Mexicans or, 'These Mexicans are all drug dealers and murderers,' I'm, like, 'Where? I haven't seen that. I'm not [one].' You know?\"\n\nSaldaña-Portillo says this bigotry results from Mexican natives' land being given to white settlers.\n\n\"[It helped create] the representation of Mexicans as these barbarous Indians,\" she said. \"That's annunciated every day when we hear Mexicans described as rapists, murderers and thieves.\"\n\nArchuleta said he's not surprised that there's racism in the U.S. because in communities like his, racism had \"never gone away.\"\n\n\"We've always felt it,\" he said. \"We've always known it. We've seen it. We've been on the receiving end of it, either through the institutions, through the bureaucracies or at the individual level.\"\n\nJuan Sanchez, a sixth-generation native of the Chililí Land Grant in New Mexico, remembers activist Reies Lopez Tijerina of the 1960s.\n\n\"We are called the forgotten people,\" Sanchez said. \"He came to New Mexico preaching the treaty and preaching and telling the people that they were gonna lose their land.\"Tijerina was a major figure in the Chicano Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which sought to reclaim Mexican Americans' indigenous heritage and original territories.\n\n\"They were articulating it concretely, saying, 'We have these land grants and we want these land grants honored as per the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,'\" Saldaña-Portillo said.\n\nTijerina's story culminates in June 1967, when he led an armed raid on a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, to free imprisoned activists and place a citizen's arrest on the district attorney who ordered a police crackdown on them.\n\n\"They were gonna go make a citizen's arrest and so it just got outta hand from there. The frustration of not being heard just exploded,\" Sanchez said. \"They [had] put all the heirs of different land grants that were the followers of Tijerina in a corral like sheep.\"\n\nIn the ensuing shootout, two police officers were wounded and two hostages were taken as the activists fled Tierra Amarilla. After a week-long manhunt, Tijerina surrendered. He was found guilty of assault on a federal officer and sentenced to two years in prison.\n\n\"He opened our eyes. He taught us,\" Sanchez said. \"He always said, 'Change the law,' and we've always tried that.\"\n\nFor fellow land grant heir and activist Steve Polanco, this fight is personal. His family has lived on Tierra Amarilla since the late 1800s, and now in his 60s, he is the president of the Tierra Amarilla Land Grant.\n\n\"We took a stand that ... the only way we were gonna be taken from here ... was dead,\" Polaco said.\n\nPolaco said the original stewards of the land shared 550,000 acres and that they would help each other.\n\n\"These mountains were full of herds of sheep, herds of pigs that were being taken care of,\" Polaco said. \"They'd head off for the day and they'd take care of their flocks, pigs, herds of horses all over these mountains.\"\n\nHis land has been under siege for decades, he said, with outside investors hoping to develop the lands into everything from a ski resort to a landing strip, the latter of which is visible from his property.\n\n\"The building of the airstrip makes me feel really bad because, number one, they destroyed the property. It looks very ugly. It's gonna cause erosion. It's so dry that the dust kicks up, and there's elderlies that live in the area; that dust affects them,\" said Polaco.\n\n\"It's very emotional, especially when you see these outsiders coming in and doing destruction and taking advantage of us,\" he said.\n\nToday, he continues to harvest hay and attempts to keep the land as undisturbed as possible. He says he wants the Treaty of Hidalgo to be honored and the lands respected, particularly in the face of a changing climate. To that end, he said it's important to elect public officials who \"know the culture and our struggle\" so that their Constitutional right to the land can be upheld.\n\nArchuleta says it took generations for these communities to fall into poverty and other socioeconomic issues, and that it'll take a long time to solve their problems as well.\n\n\"We're in a marathon. We're not in a race,\" he said.\n\nArchuleta's grandfather is buried in Manzano, New Mexico. His dad grew up there, too.\n\n\"He left in the '70s. He didn't have opportunities. That's the stuff that's hard to swallow when you're like, 'Man, this is something that was in our family and it belonged to us,'\" he said. \"And because of circumstances beyond our control, the loss of the commons, the poverty that that created... This drives the work that I do. Working with land grant communities and trying to get justice for our communities.\"\n\nIn June, Archuleta spoke before Congress as it considered a bill to give land grant heirs access to their former lands.\n\n\"What the current legislation does is it would create a federal definition of traditional uses on federal lands for land grant communities,\" he said. \"Access to fuelwood, for example, to heat your home. Access to pasture to graze livestock. And it would also require that the federal agencies work with land grant communities and consult with them.\"\n\nFor Sanchez, \"the dream of reparation would be that we'd get our land back. But we know that's impossible; times have changed.\"\n\n\"Short of that, I also think our communities are due some type of reparations in terms of monetary compensation for all the hardships that they've endured,\" Archuleta said. \"What that figure looks like to us, if we did a calculation, probably about $2.7 billion. Not to pay out individuals but to pay our communities for community development and to buy back land.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Padilla-Gutierrez hopes to transform a historic jail in her village into a museum.\n\n\"The idea is to keep the legacy alive. Do not destroy and forget the history,\" she said. \"We wish that our parents could be here to see this that we've done. We're slowly inching back to being a legitimate and prideful land grant.\"\n\nHer sister emphasized that the family doesn't \"want handouts.\"\n\n\"We wanna provide for ourselves. So justice would be giving us that opportunity to do that,\" Padilla said. \"We've always been here and we're not going anywhere... This is where we come from. This is our land and we're gonna protect it and we're gonna continue to be here as long as we possibly can.\"\n\n\"The hard work of my dad and my grandfather and my great grandfather -- their blood, sweat, and tears... I have to make sure that none of that was [in] vain,\" Archuleta added. . \"That their hopes and dreams survive on, and [that] they survive on in my kids and their kids.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

She had been using a false social security number to remain in the U.S.\n\nHer lawyers told ABC's Phoenix affiliate, KNXV, that the raid was subsequently ruled unconstitutional. Court documents obtained by KNVX also show that Garcia had previously been ordered to self-deport.\n\nRights organizations have pointed to language within Trump's executive order called \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" as having led to Garcia's deportation and other like her.\n\n\"We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States,\" the order reads.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House deferred comment on the case calling it \"an ICE matter.\"\n\nICE said that, \"Ms. Garcia, who has a prior felony conviction in Arizona for criminal impersonation, was the subject of a court-issued removal order that became final in July 2013,\" in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"Ms. Garcia's immigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the U.S.,\" the agency added. \"ICE will continue to focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal issued by the nation's immigration courts.\"\n\nPuente Arizona, an activist group that describes itself as a migrant justice organization, led a protest in front of the ICE office in Phoenix on Wednesday night, and a group spokesman confirmed to ABC News that they also had people demonstrating Thursday.\n\nPhoenix Police Sgt. John Howard confirmed to ABC News on Thursday that seven people were arrested and charged with obstructing governmental operations and obstructing a public thoroughfare.\n\nABC News' Paul Blake, Meghan Keneally and Gabriel Milian contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

And while many of the immigrants come to the states seeking jobs and security, a large number of them already were employed in their native country.\n\nTheir goal is to make money in America and to send it back home and into the Mexican economy. The transaction is a huge boost to Mexico's economy, providing $20 billion a year in additional funds.\n\nCalderon said having the youngest, strongest and bravest leaving the home country and their families take a huge toll on Mexico.\n\nCalderon told Sawyer that some of his own relatives live and work in the United States - \"some of them in the vegetable fields, others in restaurants and others in construction,\" he said.\n\nImmigration to America is a \"natural phenomenon,\" Calderon said, because Mexico has a large, young labor force that is needed by U.S. businesses, a sentiment that some politicians and business leaders across the country agree with.\n\nNew York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has said his city would \"collapse if they were deported,\" referring to Mexican immigrants.\n\nThe agriculture and the food service industries across the country are especially reliant on Mexican workers.

      "text": "Opinion: No Dogs or Mexicans Allowed\n\n\"No dogs or Mexicans allowed.\" It's hard to believe that this used to be accepta\n\nJuly 30, 2013&#151; -- Decades ago, some restaurants and stores in the Southwest posted signs ontheir doors warning \"No dogs or Mexicans allowed.\" It's hard to believe thatthis used to be acceptable.\n\nWhile those signs were taken down long ago, anti-immigrant attitudes havepersisted, particularly against Mexican immigrants. In fact, as the debate aboutimmigration reform rages in the United States, the anti-immigrant rhetoric seemsto be getting fiercer.\n\nTake the comments recently made by Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, one ofthe most determined opponents of immigration reform. On July 18, during an interview with Newsmax, a news website, King deeply insulted the so-called \"Dreamers,\" young undocumented residents (many of whom are students) who were brought to the U.S. as children and whose cause has deep support within theHispanic community. \"They aren't all valedictorians,\" King said, explaining hisopposition to the Dream Act, which would grant Dreamers a path to citizenship.\n\n\"They weren't all brought in by their parents. For every one who's avaledictorian, there's another 100 out there that, they weigh 130 pounds andthey've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds ofmarijuana across the desert. Those people would be legalized with the same act.\"\n\nKing's comments were ridiculous and tactless at best. This is the samecongressman who was denounced by many in the Hispanic community last year afterhe compared the immigration process to selecting dogs. In a speech delivered ata town hall meeting in Iowa in May 2012, King said: \"If you get the pick of thelitter, you've got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well, we've got the pick ofevery donor civilization on the planet.\"\n\nI asked him about those remarks during a recent interview. King insisted thathe had not, in fact, compared immigrants to dogs. Rather, King said, he wascelebrating the importance of legal immigration. He said that his statementswere being mischaracterized - that a liberal campaign aimed at discrediting himand dividing the country is at work. ( The interview can be seen here. )\n\nHowever, given the fact that immigrants have been equated with dogs in thiscountry's past, it is understandable that many people considered his comments tobe offensive, and even racist. And it certainly doesn't help the RepublicanParty to win over Hispanic voters when one of its members is fending off suchaccusations. Republicans should be making headlines by expressing their supportfor immigration reform, but instead they are stuck on the defensive - especiallymany Republican members of the House of Representatives, who oppose acomprehensive plan like the one recently approved by the Senate.\n\nHouse Republicans are either unable or unwilling to understand how importantthe immigration issue is to Hispanics. For us, it's personal, and the polls showthat in our community, support for immigration reform is almost universal. The16 million Hispanic voters who are expected to cast ballots in the 2016presidential election will not choose the party that opposed integrating theUnited States' 11 million undocumented residents.For a while, the lack ofimmigration legislation was blamed on President Barack Obama, who failed todeliver on a campaign promise he made in 2008 that he would bring a bill beforeCongress during his first term. But Obama and the Democratic Party have madegood on that promise, so the blame for stalled progress is now falling on theRepublicans and House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nKing's remarks are indicative of the discrimination that persists in thiscountry; a path to legalization would be a big step toward changing that. He ishardly his party's only problem, and this is not an isolated incident. Let's notforget Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio's hunting for undocumented immigrants based onthe way they look (according to accusations from the Justice Department); Gov.Jan Brewer's refusal to issue Arizona driver's licenses to Dreamers; Republicanpresidential candidate Mitt Romney's idea that immigrants would self-deport; andmost recently, Boehner's refusal to put the Senate's immigration bill up for avote in the House. The Republican Party has a problem with Hispanics, and unlessit starts working on finding solutions to the immigration issue, the GOP willnot win another national election.\n\nMaybe those signs barring dogs and immigrants are long gone, but too manyRepublican lawmakers insist on keeping the door closed.\n\n(Jorge Ramos, an Emmy Award-winning journalist, is the senior news anchor forUnivision Network.

      "text": "The legend of the Pachuco: Inside the stylish Mexican counterculture\n\nL.A. marks the Pachucos' legacy 8 decades after facing racism, mistreatment.\n\nIn the 1930s, Mexican American youth in the Southwest united to oppose racism, segregation and discrimination in the United States. Influenced by the style of Black Americans in Harlem, New York, a Mexican group called Pachucos emerged.\n\nPachucos, young Mexican Americans with a penchant for flashy attire, embraced zoot suit fashion, jump blues, jazz and swing music and affirmed their self-empowerment by rejecting assimilation into white American society.\n\nThe group was formed after the Mexican Revolution, which took place from 1910 to 1920. It was a long and bloody struggle involving several factions forming constantly shifting alliances. Ultimately, the revolution led to the end of the 30-year dictatorship in Mexico and the establishment of a constitutional republic.\n\n\"The Mexican Revolution was a huge upheaval in Mexico,\" novelist Luis J. Rodriguez told ABC News. \"A million people were killed and there were a million refugees. Even though there were Mexicans already here, a lot of the refugees ended up becoming the first barrios, especially in L.A., Texas, around Arizona, around the Southwest.\"\n\nIn Texas, between 1910 and 1920, there were massacres, killings, and lynchings, resulting in the deaths of approximately 3,000 Mexicans, mostly at the hands of Texas Rangers and others, Rodriguez said.\n\nAs Mexican laborers made their way into American lands through the Bracero program, an agreement between the U.S. and Mexico that allowed Mexican citizens to temporarily work in America to help with the crops due to an enormous manpower shortage in the U.S due to World War II. Some people didn't like the idea and said Mexicans were taking their jobs.\n\n\"Discrimination went crazy,\" Rodriguez said. \"The restrictive companies, you can't live in certain places, segregation, schools. So youth, especially in L.A., some of them just decided to just resist.\"\n\nIn the 1940s the Pachucos emerged in L.A. and introduced a new kind of fashion that would unify the resistance movement in the city.\n\n\"They were taking the zoot suit from Harlem, came out of the jazz clubs and they wear these really very stylized clothing,\" Rodriguez said. \"And the Mexicans made it more garish.\"\n\nThe zoot suit was more than just a fashion statement. It was meant to stand out because even though Mexicans weren't allowed in the same places as white Americans, they were going to make their presence known by being visible and heard as they walked around, Rodriguez said.\n\nA zoot suit is defined by its big shoulders and lapels, making it an exaggerated suit, Vanessa Estrella, owner of \"El Pachuco Zoot Suits,\" said. When you add accessories, it completely changes the look, Some common accessories include skinny belts and chains. Many people also wore necklaces to signify their religious beliefs.\n\nDuring World War II, a fabric shortage led to rationing. Newspapers at the time blamed Pachucos for undermining the war effort by using more wool. The zoot suit used a lot of fabric since it was oversized.\n\nOne news article stated, \"Every boy who buys such a garment and every person who sells it is really doing an unpatriotic deed.\"\n\n\"It was wrong,\" Rodriguez said about the news articles at the time. \"It was just being used to be an anti-Mexican, anti-Chicano attempt at Pachuco at a time when the racism was very strong and people could believe it.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles police went to great lengths to arrest young Mexican Americans and put them in prison. Pachuco Luis Garcia alleges that anyone wearing a zoot suit would be jailed if spotted on the streets.\n\nThis reached its peak in 1943, when there were riots, and sailors in downtown L.A. said Pachucos were attacking them. The riots started when sailors descended into Downtown LA and started beating up and stripping off Pachucos of their clothing. This went on for days.\n\n\"So what happens when police started arresting people for wearing zoot suits?\" Rodriguez said. \"Everybody in the community says zoot suits are illegal. You can't wear them. And then it spread like wildfire. You can't wear zoot suits in L.A.\"\n\nThis led to the decline of the Pachuco subculture into the 1950s and, in the 1960s, according to research on Grinnell College's website.\n\n\"Cultural erasement, I think, has been what they've been trying to impose from the start,\" Garcia said. \"To hear the people that looked like me were mistreated just because they looked like me or because we're different was upsetting. We're no less American than anybody else.\"\n\nLast year, Los Angeles City Hall issued an apology for the sanctioned brutality that targeted Mexican Americans, as well as African Americans and Filipinos, 80 years ago. Councilman Kevin de Leon said it was prejudicial, it was racism, and it should have never happened.\n\nFor the first time, hundreds gathered this year in their best retro outfits and vintage cars to commemorate the 81st anniversary of the Zoot Suit Riots.\n\n\"We all cruised through the bridge,\" Estrella said. \"The police was so nice and generous, they were able to close down Sixth Street Bridge. I don't think it's ever been done before. We drove all through downtown L.A. It was the most beautiful thing. Our new generation has to learn what happened in the past so that it doesn't repeat itself.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Eligible Mexicans Still Unlikely to Seek Citizenship\n\nNearly two-thirds of eligible immigrants from Mexico have not naturalized.\n\nMarch 6, 2013&#151; -- One of the hottest points of contention in the immigration reform debate is whether to offer immigrants a path to citizenship.\n\nSome anti-citizenship Republicans have said that a legalization program will give the Democrats millions of new voters. The problem is, existing data suggests that those fears are likely overblown.\n\nMore importantly, the data shows that Mexican immigrants, who make up 55 percent of the undocumented population, are less likely to become citizens than other groups.\n\nOnly about one-third of the 5.4 million legal immigrants from Mexico who are eligible to become citizens have actually naturalized. That's about half the rate of naturalization among legal immigrants from all other countries, according to the Pew Hispanic Center .\n\nThat's not because Mexican immigrants aren't interested. Pew found that more than 90 percent of Hispanic immigrants who have not yet naturalized would like to. The obstacles, however, are sometimes too overwhelming.\n\nMore than a quarter said personal barriers such as a lack of English proficiency are a problem, while nearly 20 percent said financial and administrative barriers are preventing them from trying. The application fee is $680.\n\nAbout a quarter said they have not tried or are not interested. Nearly a quarter said the citizenship test, which requires applicants to demonstrate knowledge of government and history, is too difficult.\n\nAny immigration proposal is likely to include similar requirements. Even proponents of full citizenship rights for the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants advocate an English-language requirement and the payment of back taxes.\n\nAlternatives to citizenship are still better than no legal status. Legal permanent residency -- a green card -- eliminates the threat of deportation and grants the ability to work. But green card holders can't vote or receive some other benefits such as a U.S. passport or the right to apply for most federal jobs or run for office.\n\nMost Hispanic immigrants say, though, that they would like to become citizens. Some want this for practical reasons and others because the United States feels like home. According to the survey, Mexicans are more likely than non-Mexicans to give practical reasons for becoming citizens. Non-Mexican naturalized Latinos are more likely to name family and sentimental motivations as driving factors.\n\nAs Pew notes, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was the last time the United States authorized a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and Mexican immigrants were the main beneficiaries. But only about 40 percent of the 2.7 million undocumented immigrants who received a green card through IRCA were citizens by 2009.\n\nThe rates of naturalization among Mexican immigrants today is fairly similar.\n\nIn 2011, Mexican immigrants naturalized at a rate of about 36 percent compared to 68 percent for all non-Mexican immigrants. Latin American and Caribbean immigrants had a naturalization rate of 61 percent.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Mexicans in U.S. Get New Birth Certificates\n\nImagine if you had no form of identification at all.\n\nJune 24, 2013 &#151; -- Imagine what life would be like if you had no form of documentation. No birth certificate. No driver's license. No Social Security number. No official proof that you even exist (to a government, at least).\n\nThis is the reality faced by many natives of the southwestern Mexican state of Oaxaca. Divided into 571 municipalities, Oaxaca is a mountainous state with many indigenous communities that have remained isolated from Mexican society. At least one-third of Oaxacans speak one of 16 native languages in the region; many women give birth in their isolated communities and never obtain birth certificates from the government for their children.\n\n\"You have to go to the head of municipal government, and you have to travel [long distances] sometimes without roads,\" said Carlos Sada, the New York-based Consul General of Mexico. \"So what people do is they do not register their kids, so they go around their lives without their birth certificate.\"\n\nInaccuracies, inconsistencies, and typos in birth certificates are also common in the region, because birth certificates were all once written out by hand. Any error in a birth certificate makes obtaining an official passport or identification nearly impossible. Because of all of these barriers, some Oaxacans resort to buying counterfeit birth certificates for hundreds of dollars on the black market.\n\nAn estimated 300,000 Oaxacans reside in the greater New York City area, according to Sada, and hundreds lack any real documentation from Mexico or the United States. Due to the unique birth certificate dilemma in the region, the Mexican government last week arranged a week-long visit by the Oaxacan Civil Registry to the United States to fix errors and provide birth certificates to people who can prove they are from the region.\n\nMore than 500 Oaxacans registered and received new birth certificates this year in Mexico's second annual drive in its Philadelphia and New York City consulates. Last year, 420 Oaxacans gained documentation through the program.\n\nAbelado Rojas, a 47-year-old construction worker from Oaxaca, has been living in New York City for 22 years. But an error in his original birth certificate has prevented him from obtaining any form of official Mexican identification his entire life.\n\nLast Thursday, Rojas received his first accurate birth certificate. Smiling with the document in hand, Rojas said that piece of paper would give him peace of mind.\n\n\"It's a very good service, I'm very thankful,\" Rojas said in Spanish. \"I'm very happy to have this worry gone in my life. To finally know I have this, it's a blessing.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Some soccer fans suggested sarcastically that Trump was paying tribute to the popular Mexican football team, Club América .\n\nBut not everyone is laughing. In an editorial for the Mexican newspaper El Universal , legal expert Mario Melgar-Adalid advised the country to push back.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\" Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, came up with her own proposal. CNN's Becky Anderson explains.\n\nRelated video Mexican president pushes back on Trump's call to rename the Gulf of Mexico\n\n\"Mexico must firmly oppose this interference, otherwise the next step could be that instead of the United Mexican States (Mexico's formal name), as established in our Constitution, they will begin to call us Old Mexico,\" he wrote.\n\nIn the Mexican coastal state of Veracruz, which borders the gulf, Governor Rocío Nahle rejected Trump's move. \"Today and always ... for 500 years it has been and will continue to be our rich and great 'Gulf of Mexico,'\" the governor wrote on social media last week.\n\nJuan Cobos, a former resident of Veracruz who now lives in Mexico City, called it \"absurd,\" saying hundreds of years of history could not be erased by a pen stroke.\n\n\"You can't change something overnight, what we've grown up with - history, geography, all that. You can't be so authoritarian that you can change it from one day to the next.\"\n\nAnother resident told CNN that \"many Veracruzanos express annoyance, others confusion, and for many it is amusing ... because people do not care that the name of the Gulf of Mexico will soon change, and they find it fun to play with the name change.\"\n\nAnother Mexico City resident called Trump's order \"so childish,\" telling CNN, \"Obviously it is not right.\"\n\nGoogle said on Monday its move was in line with its \"practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\" The company noted that the change would be applied only in the United States. Users in Mexico will continue to see the \"Gulf of Mexico\" on Google Maps. The rest of the world will see both names.\n\nTrump, in his executive order last week, said he directed that the body of water be renamed the Gulf of America \"in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our nation's economy and its people.\" The order calls for all federal government maps and documents to reflect the change.\n\nHe also ordered that the nation's highest mountain, Denali, change its name back to Mount McKinley, in honor of President William McKinley. Google said it would also update the name of its maps when the Geographic Names Information System, a government database of names and location data, is updated.\n\nSheinbaum responded with ridicule at the time. At a press conference, she presented a 1607 map that labeled parts of North America as \" Mexican America ,\" and dryly proposed that the gulf should be renamed as such.\n\nShe said: \"It sounds nice, no?\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

It's a compelling image, but it captures only a feeble percentage of the diversity and excellence that imbues one of the most incredible countries in the world.\n\nHere are 10 things the travel destination of Mexico does better than anywhere else:\n\nMexico's national liquor is a worldwide bar standard, with exports to 96 countries. But don't come to Mexico expecting to impress locals by chugging a syrupy sweet margarita or knocking down manly shots all night.\n\nTequila is meant to be sipped and savored, like fine whiskey, which, as any Mexican will tell you, the best tequila can compete with. You can get a taste of the branded stuff on tours such as The Tequila Express operated by Casa Herradura and the Jose Cuervo Express tour.\n\nMexican parties are notorious for going berserk in the blink of a bleary eye. That, of course, leads to a familiar disaster the following morning.\n\nFortunately, Mexico's kitchens spring to life with the best hangover grub on the planet.\n\nWake up, guzzle water then inhale some spicy chilaquiles, carnitas (pork) or barbacoa (sheep) tacos with hot sauce and plenty of revitalizing grease - maybe slam a light breakfast beer if you're in really rough shape - and you'll be back making requests from the band by nightfall.\n\nVisiting Mexico City? Insiders share tips\n\nFrom symphony orchestras to oompah bands to soul and R&B horn sections, everyone loves a blast of brass. Whereas most countries tend to save their horns for parties and special occasions, however, Mexico kicks out the brass jams on a daily basis.\n\nWhere else can you hear tubas - actual tubas! - laying down bass lines on the radio every hour of the week? It all comes down to bandas, the heart of both traditional and popular genres of Mexican music.\n\nBandas are typically comprised of 10 to 20 musicians who play brass instruments, woodwinds and various percussion. Every Mexico traveler is charmed by mariachi, but bandas are a part of several broader genres, the most characteristic being ranchera, quebradita and corridos.\n\nPlenty of cultures do ancestor worship. But who else turns the commemoration of their dearly departed into an annual fiesta of art, food and community?\n\nOn November 1, aka the Day of the Dead, Mexicans put together ofrendas (shrines) for loved ones who have passed away.  Every ofrenda includes pictures of the deceased, food, drinks, skull-shaped candies, candles and cempasuchil, the Aztec marigold or flower of the dead.\n\nThe belief is that souls of children come back to earth to visit family and friends on November 1 and the souls of adults do the same on November 2.\n\nDay of the Dead festivals take place across Mexico. Three of the most elaborate are held in San Andrés Mixquic (in Tláhuac, Mexico City), Patzcuaro , Michoacán and Janitzio , Michoacán.\n\nVisiting Cancún? Insiders share tips\n\nCalled \"albur\" in Spanish, double entendre isn't just a linguistic trick for Mexicans, it's an art form requiring a nimble mind and the ability to convey smart but subtle messages, often laced with sexual or R-rated undertones.\n\nMany languages, of course, employ veiled connotations and witty wordplay. But albur is so important in Mexico that there's a national tournament to crown the best alburero.\n\nThe \"Queen of Albur\" is Lourdes Ruiz, who's dominated the competition since 1997, defeating men and women.\n\nShe even teaches albur courses. Still not convinced Mexicans take double entendre more seriously than anyone else?\n\nWhat other country has a day devoted to the subtle intricacies of its language? In Mexico, Albur's Day is celebrated on March 1.\n\nVatican City does a pretty fair job as the center of the faith and it has some decent paintings on its ceiling. But its population of 800 souls isn't exactly staggering.\n\nMexico, by contrast, ranks second in the world for number of Catholics (Brazil is first, the Philippines third) and, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico, 83.9% of the Mexicans are Catholic.\n\nNothing says \"Mexican Catholic\" like a reverence for the country's seemingly endless manifestations of the Virgin Mary. That may be why the priest Miguel Hidalgo carried a symbolic flag of Guadalupe when he led the opening stages of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810.\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe is the most venerated Virgin in Mexico, maybe the world. The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City is also one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mexico, reportedly the most visited Marian shrine in the world. Each December 12, about 5 million pilgrims from across Mexico visit the Basilica to thank the Virgin for her favors or to ask for a miracle.\n\nBasilica of Our Lady of Gaudalupe , Plaza de las Americas 1, Col. Villa de Guadalupe, Delegación Gustavo A. Madero, Mexico City; +52 55 5118 0500\n\nKnown around the country as Vitamin T, tacos, tortas, tamales and tostadas are part of the everyday life. Mexicans are constantly on the go, so it's no wonder puestos and changarros (food stands) can be found on practically every corner.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're in the subway, leaving school or taking a lunch break away from the office - Mexico's streets offer endless options for a fast and delicious meal cooked right in front of you with super-fresh ingredients.\n\nOn the trail of the world's best tacos in Mexico City\n\nIn 1958, Telesistema Mexicano produced \"Senda Prohibida\" (\"Forbidden Path\"), the first Mexican telenovela (soap opera).  Fifty-six years later, its successor Televisa has produced a whopping 740 telenovelas.\n\nThe formula hasn't changed much. A man and woman fall in love but, for tragic reasons, can't be together. After overcoming obstacles they finally get married.\n\nFifteen years after exporting its first soap opera, \"Los Ricos Tambien Lloran\" (\"The Rich Cry Too\"), Televisa has found a rich market outside Mexico as well.\n\nTelevisa isn't the only network producing successful telenovelas. TV Azteca and Argos Comunicación also create top-notch weepers.\n\nProfessional wrestling (lucha libre) may be more Hollywood north of the border, and grittier in other countries, but nowhere is it as full of pathos as in Mexico. Those hilarious/spooky masks aren't just fun to look at, they're a major part of the drama.\n\nRemoving one from an opponent's head is one of the greatest triumphs and most thrilling moments in lucha libre. Matches are held at Arena Mexico in Mexico City. Tickets can be purchased from Ticketmaster .\n\nMexicans' deep fear of appearing rude has given us a bred-in-the-bone aversion to uttering the word \"no.\" Instead - and unfortunately for those unfamiliar with the rules of courtesy here - we've developed a talent for white lies that allow us to say yes to fulfilling any request.\n\nEven if we can't do anything about it.\n\nWhite lies can be as clichéd as \"the dog ate my homework\" or as morbid as \"my beloved great aunt has suddenly developed pancreatic cancer.\" But the granddaddy of polite lies is \"ahorita.\"\n\n\"Ahorita\" literally means \"right now,\" but it's almost never that. When a Mexican tells you they'll do something \"ahorita,\" be prepared to take a seat, because the wait can be long.\n\nThink of ahorita as the Mexican art of procrastination - it's been passed from generation to generation - a term that can mean anything from \"in 10 minutes\" to \"in three weeks.\"\n\nAhorita's cousin in crime is \"I'm on my way.\" This really means, \"I'm on my way to finishing this TV show, maybe getting off the couch, calling my sister, taking a shower, grabbing a snack and actually leaving home to meet you.\"\n\nYou've been warned - we're great at it!\n\nOriginally published in May 2014.

      "text": "3 myths about Mexico and migration, debunked\n\nUS President Donald Trump says Mexico isn't doing enough to stop immigration - and he's threatening to saddle Mexican goods with tariffs as result .\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador counters that Trump's \"America First\" slogan is a fallacy , arguing the US needs to do more to respond to a regional crisis that's forcing desperate migrants to flee their homes.\n\nAs both countries' top diplomats negotiate with a deadline looming for them to make a deal, here's a look at some common myths about Mexico and migration - and what's actually happening south of the US-Mexico border:\n\nReality: Deportations from Mexico have been on the rise in recent months, and the country has launched several new efforts in response to the situation.\n\nIn the face of Trump's threat, Mexican officials have been pressing hard in recent days to tout their efforts to step up immigration enforcement and using data to make their case.\n\nIn a statement released Monday , Mexico's government said authorities there have deported 80,537 people since December. That's a 33% increase from the number of migrants Mexico deported in the previous six-month period (60,605 from June-November 2018) and a 54% increase from the same time period the previous year (52,359 from December 2017-May 2018), according to Mexico's interior ministry.\n\nMexican authorities have also been apprehending more people, said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America.\n\n\"They are certainly responding in a different way to the flow of people coming through Mexico,\" she said. \"We've seen, actually, in recent weeks even more announcements of a crackdown in southern Mexico, and them even raiding a few hotels.\"\n\nLopez Obrador, who took office in December, emphasized migrants' rights in his campaign and said he wouldn't do \"dirty work\" for the United States when it came to controlling immigration.\n\n\"You saw initially in the first two months of the administration, more humanitarian visas being offered and many fewer detentions and deportations,\" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nBut that's significantly shifted now, Wilson said.\n\n\"Mexico started to increase those levels of detentions and deportations. They very quickly got back to the historic averages over the last several years, and in recent months have gone way beyond that. ...  They're now, within the last few weeks, detaining and deporting a huge number of Central American migrants. So the idea that Mexico is doing nothing is just patently false,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"Could Mexico do more? Yeah, I think so. Is Mexico not doing anything? That's just absolutely wrong.\"\n\nBeyond detention and deportation, Mexican officials have also been trying to address what they say are the root causes of migration and encouraging the US to support more development initiatives in Central America.\n\n\"President Trump: social problems are not resolved with tariffs or coercive measures,\" Lopez Obrador wrote in a letter last week. That's a message Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard will likely take to the negotiating table as well.\n\nReality: Central American families make up the largest numbers of people apprehended after illegally crossing the US border.\n\nWhile the majority of single adults apprehended at the border are from Mexico, that number is far surpassed by the number of family members apprehended, according to US Customs and Border Protection statistics .\n\n\"These are not the single, male Mexican border-crossers that we saw in the '90s and 2000s,\" said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America. \"There's a very different face of migrants that, as we've seen at the border, presents a lot of different challenges.\"\n\nAnd for years, demographers have been pointing out that net migration from Mexico has actually slowed - meaning more Mexicans are leaving the United States than coming.\n\nIt's a common misconception to think that Mexicans make up the majority of undocumented immigrants crossing the border, Wilson said, adding that it's myth that could have serious consequences for policymakers.\n\n\"We're still thinking about migration with a vision that's maybe 20 years old at this point. We're not - as the public or even as policymakers - catching up fully,\" Wilson said. \"The ground has shifted beneath our feet, and we're still operating as if it's the old world.\"\n\nReality: Public opinion about immigration is divided in Mexico.\n\n\"There's a mix of opinions in Mexico, just as there is in the United States,\" Wilson said.\n\nAnd in some areas, support for migrants has been waning .\n\n\"You've seen a souring of public opinion in parts of Mexico, just given the numbers,\" Meyer said.\n\nAs so-called caravans of migrants from Central America moved through Mexico last year, a public opinion survey from El Universal newspaper found that many people were not ready to roll out the welcome mat.\n\nAlmost 48% of respondents agreed undocumented Central American immigrants should be allowed to enter Mexico and be granted refuge, while almost 38% were against it. Others said they were undecided or didn't have a strong feeling either way.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, nearly a third of those surveyed said they believed undocumented migrants should be expelled from the country immediately.\n\nA 2018 Pew Research Center survey found that 43% of Mexicans support the deportation of immigrants living there illegally.\n\nAnother factor fueling public opinion: thousands of migrants waiting in a bottleneck at the US border to seek asylum at ports of entry - and thousands more Central American migrants who the US has sent back to Mexico to wait while their asylum cases make their way through US immigration courts.\n\n\"The shelters are full. There are migrants in the streets. There's disruption to their communities and their day-to-day lives,\" Wilson said. \"That's not a recipe for strong support for migrants.\"\n\nCNN's Natalie Gallón, Fidel Gutierrez and Geneva Sands contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Mexicans vote in historic election expected to choose first woman president\n\nFollow:\n\nMexicans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in a historic election, overshadowed by violence, that is expected to return the country's first woman president.\n\nThe two leading presidential candidates are women: Claudia Sheinbaum from the leftist Morena party and Xochitl Gálvez, from the conservative PAN party, who is representing a coalition of opposition parties.\n\nThe third candidate is Jorge Álvarez Máynez, the youngest in the race, who is representing the center-left Citizens' Movement.\n\nSunday's poll is the largest election in the country's history. More than 98 million voters are registered to cast a ballot in Mexico, and 1.4 million Mexicans are eligible to vote abroad. More than 20,000 positions are set to be filled with an estimated 70,000 candidates vying to become senators, mayors and governors.\n\nRelated live-story Mexico's 2024 presidential election\n\nViolence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico's history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations trying to influence those coming into power.\n\nWhile voting was largely peaceful on Sunday, it was suspended in the southeastern Mexican town of Coyomeapan due to violence at the polling centers in the morning, according to state electoral authorities.\n\nThe poll is seen by some as a referendum on the policies of outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador - Sheinbaum's mentor whose popular social welfare helped poorer Mexicans, but whose \"hugs, not bullets\" policy of not confronting cartels has not led to a substantial drop in homicide numbers.\n\nHe greeted supporters as he voted on Sunday. Meanwhile, as Sheinbaum made her way to cast her ballot, she called for Mexicans to vote, telling reporters: \"This is a historic day, I am feeling very happy.\" Gálvez told reporters at a polling station that she was expecting it to be a long day and a very close call.\n\nPolls opened at 8 a.m. local time and will close at 6 p.m., according to Mexico's National Electoral Institute (INE).\n\nHowever, on Sunday, some voting stations in parts of the country opened with delays. Long lines were seen in Mexico City, Yucatán, Tuxtla, Cuauhtémoc, and voting centers abroad.\n\nRelated video Mexico set to elect its first female president\n\nOne exasperated woman in Mexico City, who had been waiting for 40 minutes for her polling station to open, said she would not be able to vote before the polls closed at 6 p.m. as she had to go to work.\n\nIn Madrid, Spain, expatriate Mexicans told CNN they waited more than eight hours to cast their ballots. One Mexican voter said she had been in line for 11 hours. Authorities are telling them INE is to blame.\n\nPolls were meant to open at 8 a.m. local time in Madrid, but INE posted on social media on Sunday afternoon saying voters waiting in line at embassies in Madrid and Paris could now cast their ballots. They added that the polls will close once 1,500 votes have been cast or everyone who registered votes. CNN has contacted the Mexican Embassy in Madrid for comment.\n\nOf the more than 200,000 expatriate votes expected to come from abroad, more than 70% will be coming from voters living in the United States. Outside the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles, thousands of people queued up to vote on Sunday as some in the crowd chanted \"Morena\" - the name of the ruling party.\n\nWhoever is elected will face several challenges, including security, organized crime, energy, and immigration. They will also set the tone for the US-Mexico bilateral relationship.\n\nOutside polling stations, voters told CNN that public security was one of their main concerns.\n\nA minute of silence was held on Sunday by the advisers of the INE in memory of the people who have been murdered during this electoral period. There have been more than 20 political killings since September according to the Mexican government. By some estimates, that number is even higher, at least 34 candidates murdered, according to Mexican consultancy firm, Integralia.\n\nWhile the murder rate fell in Mexico between 2019 and 2022 , in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 each year, experts say.\n\nBoth Sheinbaum and Gálvez have largely remained coy about their proposals regarding security. Neither has repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime - which has coincided with the high numbers of homicides.\n\nThe central challenge for the next president will be convincing voters that she can end the culture of impunity in Mexico, where around 95% of all crimes nationwide went unsolved in 2022, according to the think tank Mexico Evalua.\n\nUS officials are closely monitoring the presidential election as it comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. A record number of migrants at the US-Mexico border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration's impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue.\n\nIn recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US' southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation.\n\n\"Whether we're talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\" a Homeland Security official previously told CNN.\n\nCNN's Gustavo Valdés, Karol Suarez, Priscilla Alvarez and Esha Mitra contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Mexico wants a deal with Trump to avoid receiving non-Mexican deportees\n\nFollow:\n\nMexico hopes to strike a deal with President-elect Donald Trump to limit the number of third-country deportees it could receive from the US, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Thursday.\n\nA similar deal to send deportees directly to their country of origin is already in place with the current Biden administration.\n\n\"We hope to have an agreement with the Trump administration,\" Sheinbaum said Thursday during her daily press conference adding that Mexico is \"in solidarity with everyone, but [Mexico's] main function is to receive Mexicans.\"\n\nFaced with the prospect of mass deportations across the US-Mexico border, Sheinbaum said her administration is setting up meetings with Mexican border states governors - Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas - so \"we can agree on how to receive our compatriots.\"\n\n\"We hope [mass deportations] don't happen, but if they do, we will be ready to receive them,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman to Trump transition team, said Trump \"was given a mandate by the American people to stop the invasion of illegal immigrants, secure the border, and deport dangerous criminals and terrorists that make our communities less safe. He will deliver.\"\n\nSheinbaum's comments come after a November 27 call with Trump about the two countries' shared border and the fentanyl crisis, a conversation she described as \"excellent\" in a post on X.\n\nTrump, too, said the call was \"wonderful\" in a post on Truth Social, and went further, claiming that Sheinbaum had \"agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.\" Sheinbaum has denied proposing to seal the border.\n\n\"Everyone has their own way of communicating, but I can assure you, I give you the certainty that we would never - and we would be incapable of it - propose that we would close the border,\" Sheinbaum said. \"It has never been our approach and of course we don't agree with that.\"\n\nThat was the first time they had spoken since Trump promised massive tariff hikes on goods from Mexico on the first day of his administration, in retaliation for illegal immigration and \"crime and drugs\" moving across the border. Sheinbaum has warned of possible counter-tariffs in response.\n\nMexico has also highlighted its actions to address the fentanyl trade and border crisis in recent days. On Wednesday, the Mexican government announced what it said was the largest fentany l bust in the country's history, with over a ton of the synthetic opioid seized in two raids in the cartel-ridden northern state of Sinaloa. Just hours later, the government released data showing that an average of around 5,200 migrants have been detained each day in Mexico since Sheinbaum took office on October 1.\n\nThe US southern border has become a global crossroads, where Mexican and non-Mexican migrants congregate with hopes of crossing into the US, often after making long and arduous journeys across the world. Since 2022, US Customs and Border Protection have recorded a yearly average of over half a million encounters with migrants from Central American nations, such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Thousands of encounters have also involved migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and increasingly China, among others.\n\nElsewhere in Latin America, the Panamanian Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the country would not accept migrants of other nationalities who may be deported by the future Trump administration from the United States.\n\n\"In light of international law, we have no obligation to accept deportees of nationalities other than Panamanian. We wish to maintain relations with the United States always within the framework of mutual respect,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"This Foreign Ministry clearly understands that our main mission is to protect the interests of the Republic of Panama,\" it added.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's team, told CNN that the president-elect received a mandate from the American people to stop what she called \"the invasion of illegal immigrants, secure the border and deport dangerous criminals and terrorists\" who make their communities less safe. \"He will comply,\" she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nReporting contributed by Veronica Calderon, Elizabeth González and Mauricio Torres\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Mexico's next president will be a woman. But violence has overshadowed the glass ceiling being shattered.\n\nFollow:\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was campaigning for president in southern Mexico when hooded men approached her car, filming the interaction as they implored her to keep their town from being taken over by gangs.\n\nOne man said he felt helpless, and that the government had \"never done anything for these lands.\" They lived in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state and an increasingly important territory for criminal organizations moving illegal drugs, firearms and migrants from neighboring Guatemala. Sheinbaum thanked the men, shaking one of their hands before her car pulled away.\n\nThe former Mexico City mayor is the frontrunner in a landmark election this weekend where Mexico is all but certain to emerge with its first female president - a remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where around 10 women are murdered every day.\n\nSheinbaum is riding on a wave of popularity with the support of her long-time ally, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and their leftist Morena party. Trailing her in the polls is former senator Xochitl Gálvez, from the conservative PAN party, who is representing a coalition of opposition parties.\n\nBut what should have been celebrated as a ground-breaking election has become overshadowed by the bloodiest election campaign in Mexico's history, and ongoing high levels of violence across the country.\n\nAt least 34 political candidates or applicants have been murdered since June 2023 as gangs try and influence those coming into power, according to a report by research group Laboratorio Electoral, which also found hundreds of attacks on candidates and people related to the current electoral process.\n\nAnd while the murder rate has fallen in Mexico between 2019 and 2022 , in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 people murdered each year, say experts.\n\nThe central challenge for the next president will be convincing voters that she can end the near-certain impunity in Mexico; around 95% of all crimes nationwide went unsolved in the country in 2022, according to think tank Mexico Evalua.\n\n\"Mexico is a country where more than nine out of 10 crimes committed against the population go unpunished,\" Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. \"It's a country with low levels of reporting of crimes due largely to distrust in authorities, lack of faith in investigations, which can be very well founded.\"\n\nMexico is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, which was cemented in 2019 constitution reform. It outflanks several countries in terms of women's parliamentary representation .\n\nYet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with sky-high femicide rates for the region . The most recent data from Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography found that at least 11,852 femicides were recorded in the first three years of López Obrador's presidency - higher than the 7,439 reported during the same period of Enrique Peña Nieto's presidency (2012-2018).\n\nWith security topping voter concerns, both Sheinbaum and Gálvez have largely remained coy about their proposals. Neither has repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime - which has coincided with historically high levels of homicides.\n\nSheinbaum, a former climate scientist, has pledged to continue with her predecessor's policies. She has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team indicating having improved conditions for police and better intelligence gathering about criminal networks.\n\nGalvez has been critical of López Obrador's non-confrontational approach to cartels. She has suggested pulling forces back from domestic security roles, increasing the number of police in violent areas, and building a new high security prison .\n\nRelated video Murder of three surfers highlights Mexico's unsolved crime crisis\n\n\"In 2018, millions of Mexicans voted for change with hope, but the truth is that it did not happen,\" Gálvez said during a presidential debate in April, taking aim at the incumbent's approach to tackling organized crime.\n\n\"Claudia Sheinbaum is offering to continue the hugs for criminals ... I am offering to build a Mexico where we can end violence, but above all, to bet on health and education.\"\n\nBoth have spoken of the need to strengthen police and civilian institutions, and better use intelligence and coordination. \"But the extent to which either one of them really means to emphasize or follow through on that is very unclear,\" Brewer said.\n\nExperts have been underwhelmed by the lack of new approaches to the security situation, saying there is a connection between militarization and more bloodshed in the country since its inception in 2006, when former President Felipe Calderón declared an all-out-war against criminal groups.\n\n\"Mexico cannot deploy its way out of problems like impunity or corruption in institutions or lack of effective criminal investigation,\" Brewer told CNN. \"Militarization simply is not a tool that could ever do that.\"\n\nIncumbent López Obrador won the presidency in 2018 on a platform of demilitarizing the country's war against drug cartels, vowing to restore peace with \"hugs, not bullets.\"\n\nPopular social welfare programs would address the root causes of economic insecurity, instead of violent confrontations with criminal groups, he promised. It was a strategy that saw the son of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman released on the orders of López Obrador in 2019 to avoid bloodshed . He was later re-arrested and extradited to the US.\n\nHowever, he never really de-militarized public security. López Obrador instead merged several law-enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, to create the National Guard that was, in principle, to be under civilian command. But he soon after placed the body under the Secretary of Defense, sparking criticism across the political spectrum, which said it was furthering militarization in Mexico.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld an opposition complaint and ordered López Obrador to return the National Guard to civilian jurisdiction. He said he would follow suit, but the National Guard still reports to the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThis creation was part of what Brewer described as a \"populist...and highly visible measure that\" intended to give the perception that something is being done about crime. The National Guard has gone on to take over several civilian functions including building infrastructure projects and airport management ­- a situation ripe for corruption, warn Mexico watchers.\n\nMeanwhile, criminal groups have only expanded their reach.\n\nA May report by the Crisis Group documented limited crime-fighting where there were large military deployments in areas most affected by warring cartels. Instead, the report found that \"a set of largely unspoken rules has been established, encouraging illegal groups to reduce and conceal the violence they perpetrate,\" the report wrote.\n\n\"In exchange, authorities have turned a blind eye to a degree of illegality, enabling these organisations to diversify their trafficking operations (including into newer illicit drugs such as fentanyl), expand their extortion rackets, branch out into legal business, and assume greater control of communities and local governments.\"\n\nThis may have distorted official statistics around homicides, Falko Ernst, a senior analyst on Mexico at the Crisis Group who led the report, told CNN. \"But what we have seen in a number of high conflict states is that while official murders have dropped, disappearances have gone up, even the official ones, so that puts another question mark behind the drop in homicides,\" he said.\n\nRelated article Opinion: Mexico is about to elect its first woman president. The US isn't heading in that direction anytime soon\n\nThe report found there was also political pressure to reduce the recorded rate of lethal violence has led to \"murders being logged under other causes of death or going unrecorded.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the Mexican Secretary of Defence for comment.\n\nThere is a through line between militarization and gender-based violence in Mexico, say experts.\n\nFeminist groups in the country began documenting a \"dramatic increase in women being killed by firearms\" after 2007 as well as women being targeted in the public sphere,\" said Gema Kloppe-Santamaría, assistant professor of Latin American History at George Washington University.\n\nFemale homicides often fail to get prosecuted, with 88.6% impunity rate for femicide cases, according to Mexico Evalua.\n\nBoth candidates have recognized the crisis of femicide, but Sheinbaum, who holds a sizeable polling lead against Galvaz, has a tense relationship with some feminists \"who encountered lots of repression by Mexico City police under the purview of Sheinbaum,\" said Kloppe-Santamaría.\n\nSheinbaum has touted her efforts for women and girls, saying there was \"zero impunity\" to femicides in Mexico City during her time as leader, and that there was a large reduction in femicides under her watch. Though the claims have not borne out after some scrutiny , say critics.\n\nAmid ongoing \"gender-based violence, including femicides and disappearances,\" Kloppe-Santamaría said, getting a female president at this moment feels \"very paradoxical.\"\n\nCNN en Espanol's Inés Amarelo, Jose Manuel Alvarez and Ivonne Valdés contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Here are 3 reasons why\n\nFollow:\n\nMigrant crossings are rising again at the US-Mexico border .\n\nWhy is this occurring, and what could happen next?\n\nTo better understand the situation, CNN spoke with Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.\n\nRuiz says there's a key detail many debates about migration and the US-Mexico border frequently leave out.\n\n\"Oftentimes,\" he says, \"we're not looking farther south.\"\n\nRuiz says it's likely the number of border crossings will continue to increase, and he says there are three reasons why this is happening right now:\n\nData from the Panamanian government shows the number of migrants making the perilous crossing through the Darien Gap is on the rise , Ruiz says.\n\nMany of those migrants are from Venezuela, where a socioeconomic crisis - fueled by President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian government and worsened by the global pandemic and US sanctions - has led one in four Venezuelans to flee the country since 2015.\n\nData from the Darien Gap, a treacherous crossing through the jungles of Panama and Colombia, has become an important tool in predicting what we can expect to see at the US-Mexico border. Ruiz describes it as \"foreshadowing for the future.\"\n\n\"No matter what the US does today, in five weeks or so, we're likely going to see the number of migrants from Venezuela rising in the same or higher numbers,\" Ruiz says, \"unless Mexico increases enforcement or something else happens in the region.\"\n\nUS policies at the border changed in May when authorities lifted pandemic-era public health restrictions and put in place new measures aimed at deterring illegal immigration. And data in the immediate aftermath seemed to suggest the deterrent effect was working.\n\nBut even though the number of apprehensions at the US-Mexico border decreased, Ruiz says data from officials in Mexico and Honduras told a different story. Yes, the number of migrants crossing into the US had decreased. But migrants were still making their way north across Central America and Mexico.\n\n\"People were migrating,\" Ruiz says. \"They were just spending more time in Mexico.\"\n\nMany migrants were waiting \"to understand what the policies of the Biden administration post-Title 42\" would be, Ruiz says.\n\nBoth migrants and smugglers keep a close eye on US policies, Ruiz says, and many adjust their plans accordingly.\n\n\"If smugglers figure out that families are making it through, then more families will come,\" he says. And similarly, migrants are more likely to cross in areas along the border where they've heard more people have been successful.\n\nIncreases in violence in certain regions of Mexico have also fueled more migration.\n\n\"More Mexicans are trying to come,\" Ruiz says.\n\nUS government data shows more Mexican families coming to the border, likely to seek asylum, he says. In July 2022, for example, CBP figures indicate 4,000 Mexican family encounters at the border. A year later, that number had more than quadrupled, reaching nearly 22,000.\n\nIt's important to remember that a complicated mix of factors fuel migration in the Western Hemisphere, Ruiz says.\n\n\"These are the three levers that are in play right now. ... And regardless of what the Biden administration does today or tomorrow,\" he says, \"the people that are on the way already are going to continue, unless something else happens in the region.\"\n\nCNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Natalie Gallón, Brice Lainé and Carlos Villalón contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

The survey published Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center also says that of the 34% of Mexicans who indicated they would like to move to the U.S., 17% \"would do so without authorization,\" meaning without legal documents.\n\nKatie Simmons, senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, says that attitude has changed little in the past five years.\n\n\"It's been relatively constant,\" Simmons said.  \"We first asked people about this in 2009, and the percentage was 33%, compared to 34% this year.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the survey found that fewer Mexicans have friends or family in the United States.  According to Simmons, this means the migration of Mexicans to the United States has continued to decline in the last few years.  The number of Mexicans who report having a friend or family member living in the U.S. has fallen to 32%, compared with 42% in 2007.\n\nRelated video Zelaya: \"Children will continue to migrate\"\n\nRelated video How is Obama handling the border crisis?\n\nRelated video Humanitarian crisis ... in America?\n\n\"The most interesting finding that we reported in terms of migration is this change in the percentage of Mexicans who have friends or relatives in the United States.  This percentage is a reflection of the change in net migration.  It's an objective indicator of current migration trends,\" Simmons said.\n\nThe Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that net migration from Mexico to the United States fell to zero (and perhaps less) between 2005 and 2010, meaning the number of Mexicans migrating north is equal to or less than those going back to their country.\n\nThe latest Pew survey \"is based on face-to-face interviews conducted among a representative sample of 1,000 randomly selected adults from across the country between April 21 and May 2, 2014.\"\n\nThe survey covered a wide range of topics including the popularity of current President Enrique Pena Nieto (51%), which declined 6 percentage points in the past year as he pushed through energy and communications reforms some view with suspicion.\n\nCrime continues to be the top concern for Mexicans (79%), followed by corruption of political leaders (72%) and drug cartel-related violence (72%).\n\nThe survey also shows that Mexicans seem to have a very positive image of the military (75%), although many people are concerned about human rights violations as the armed forces continue to fight criminal organizations.\n\nThe survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nFast facts: Immigration statistics\n\nObama weighs sending National Guard to border\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

These genetic differences show up even today, the team at Stanford, the University of California, San Francisco and the Mexican National Institute of Genomic Medicine found.\n\n\"Mexico harbors one of the largest amounts of pre-Columbian genetic diversity in the Americas,\" said Stanford's Dr. Andres Moreno-Estrada. \"For the first time, we've mapped this diversity to a very fine geographic scale, and shown that it has a notable physiological impact on an important clinical trait: lung function.\"\n\nThey compared their genetic map to tests of lung function as measured by the volume of air a person can expel in one second or FEV1. They found a 7 percent difference in baseline FEV1 as they moved from populations in the western state of Sonora to Yucatan in the east.\n\n\"We were really fascinated by these results because we had expected that 500 years of population movements, immigration and mixing would have swamped the signal of pre-Columbian population structure,\" said Bustamante.\n\nThe differences hold even though most Mexicans are mestizos. \"Today, the majority of Mexicans are admixed and can trace their ancestry back not only to indigenous groups but also to Europe and Africa,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nIt will be important as medicine becomes increasingly tailored based on an individual's genes.

Significant reforms to Mexico's pension system are also expected to go into effect right before Election Day next month.\n\nFor Clara Mejía Orta, 30, pensions are among the top issues motivating her to vote by mail from Los Angeles, the American city with the highest number of Mexican nationals with valid voter identifications .\n\n\"A lot of my family members have worked their entire life and are about to retire, but they can't,\" she said. \"There's no money to pay their pensions.\"\n\nWhile Sheinbaum's platform may appear to echo Mejia Orta's concerns over prioritizing pensions, Mejía Orta said she feels conflicted about the candidate's potential handling of economic and immigration issues that also matter to her. Before mailing her ballot in, Mejía Orta plans on getting additional insight from her family in Mexico to make her final choice.\n\nSheinbaum has said that Mexicans who live abroad are crucial to translating foreign policy into \"internal well-being\" for Mexico, according to Gabriela Cuevas, a former senator and Morena member.\n\nRemittances sent by Mexicans living abroad are considered one of Mexico's main sources of income , López Obrador has said. A recent BBVA report found remittances to Mexico grew 7.6% in 2023, reaching $63.3 billion. Almost all (96%) came from the U.S.\n\n\"The community of Mexicans in the United States not only sends a lot of remittances,\" Cuevas said in Spanish. \"We must support them, protect them and leverage their skills so that they can contribute to the economy, to academia, to sciences.\"\n\nJennifer Chavez Ramirez of Los Angeles said she plans to vote for Sheinbaum and will be casting her ballot online, an option that is widely available to any Mexican living abroad who has registered. In previous elections, the online option was offered only in selected Mexican states.\n\nChavez Ramirez, 28, is a recipient of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said she has good memories of Sheinbaum from when she visited Mexico City in 2022 through \" advance parole ,\" a program that allowed her to travel to Mexico and ensured that she would be allowed to return to the U.S.\n\nChavez Ramirez said Sheinbaum welcomed her and other Mexican undocumented young immigrants who've been in the U.S. since they were children and are able to work and study under the DACA program.\n\n\"She acknowledged the challenges we face in the United States, and offered encouragement and support,\" Chavez Ramirez said. \"It is important for our experiences and voices to be taken into consideration on both sides of the border.\"\n\nLópez Obrador's Morena party dominated in the 2018 election after positioning itself as an alternative against the traditional political parties that had long governed Mexico such as the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, the small progressive Democratic Revolution Party, and the old-guard Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. This is a big reason why Morena's \"vision of government\" centers around reforming Mexico's judicial system and local governments, according to Campos.\n\nBut presidential candidate Xóchitl Gálvez of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Mexico - which is made up of more traditional political parties - has been working to convince voters that  continuing the Morena regime \"puts the country at risk,\" Campos said.\n\nGálvez's party argues that health care access and economic development have stalled under Morena and crime rates remain high.\n\nJorge Álvarez Máynez, the Citizen Movement party's presidential candidate, is running a distant third in the polls.\n\nThis is the first election in which Mexican nationals abroad were able to vote in-person in selected Mexican consulates in the U.S., Canada and Europe.\n\nOn Monday, Garcia and about 100 other voters cast their ballots for Gálvez at the Mexican Consulate in Dallas, the U.S. city with the second-highest number of Mexican nationals with valid voter identifications .\n\nThey all dressed in pink and carried signs that read \"marea rosa,\" Spanish for \"pink wave,\" in support of the movement led by the Broad Front for Mexico coalition.\n\nSupporters of the \"marea rosa\" believe López Obrador is destroying democracy in Mexico, Garcia said, accusing the president of dismantling government institutions and militarizing the country.\n\nTo Garcia, Sheinbaum \"is a puppet\"of López Obrador and a vote for her is also a vote for him, she said.\n\nJuan Hernandez, a former secretary of migrant and foreign affairs in Guanajuato, Mexico, is a vocal supporter of Gálvez. Hernandez, who is half Mexican and half American , said he plans to vote online.\n\nHe believes Gálvez, a senator and tech entrepreneur of Indigenous heritage, represents the change \"Mexicans are desperate for,\" Hernandez said in Spanish. \"That's why migrants leave the country, because they lack the opportunities they deserve in Mexico. They leave for the U.S. to seek better jobs, to escape crime and find security.\"\n\nAs a Mexican national in the U.S., Jorge Leal has consistently voted in Mexico's elections by mail.\n\n\"A big part of why I vote, knowing my vote as a binational citizen is not as impactful yet, is to honor the work of groups that emerged in the 1980s and '90s and were created by Mexican immigrants in areas like South East Los Angeles to amplify the community's voice,\" Leal, a history professor at the University of California, Riverside said.\n\nNicole Acevedo reported from New York, Cora Cervantes from Los Angeles, and Kayla McCormick from Dallas.\n\nNicole Acevedo is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.\n\nCora Cervantes is an associate producer at NBC News.\n\nKayla McCormick is a producer for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

At dawn that day, the invading Russian forces bombed an airfield there.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave. My whole life was there,\" Becerra, 50, told Noticias Telemundo from Mexico City. \"The bombs convinced me I had to grab a few things, put them in a suitcase and leave with my son, my daughter-in-law and cats.\"\n\nBecerra, a language teacher who lived in Ukraine for 32 years, was part of the first group of 81 people the Mexican government evacuated from Romania on March 4. In that group were 44 Mexicans, 28 Ukrainians, seven Ecuadorians, one Peruvian and one Australian who managed to escape the rigors of war.\n\nThe Mexican government recently announced that a second plane will fly to Romania to evacuate a second group.\n\nNearly 3 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine since the invasion began. About 116,000 of them are \"third country nationals,\" not Ukrainians. The majority have fled to neighboring Poland. Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia have also taken in people fleeing across the border.\n\nThe war appears far from over. Russia's forces have pummeled Ukraine, and deadly strikes hit a residential part of Kyiv on Tuesday.\n\nFor Becerra, the ordeal began Feb. 24. She had accompanied a Mexican friend to run errands at the Mexican Embassy in Kyiv when the invasion began. Since the subway was closed, people flooded the streets. The trip back home, which usually takes 25 minutes with traffic, took 7 1/2 hours.\n\nAt 11 the next morning, Becerra was on her way out of Ukraine in her car. Although she had few belongings, she said she managed to leave with what was most important: her son, daughter-in-law and six cats.\n\nAmid curfews and heavy traffic with hundreds of thousands of people struggling to reach the borders, Becerra passed through cities like Vasylkiv, Bila Tserkva, Khmelnytskyi, Kamianets-Podilskyi and Chernivtsi.\n\n\"They only sold us 20 liters of gasoline at the stations, and we had to wait many hours in the cold,\" Becerra said. \"We had to walk along sidewalks and back roads. That's why it took us four days to make a trip that normally takes 12 hours at most.\"\n\nDespite the relentless attacks by Russia, many foreigners have decided to stay in Ukraine to help fight back. Others have stayed in nearby countries, so they can return as soon as possible.\n\nLarissa García, who is Mexican, evacuated Ukraine along with Becerra but stayed in the Romanian capital of Bucharest to be close to her husband, who is in the midst of the war.\n\n\"Feeling like a refugee and not a tourist are very different feelings. I realized that when I got here, and it's very unpleasant,\" García said. \"I'm not going back to Mexico. My soul, my heart and my spirit are in Ukraine.\"\n\nGarcía lived in Ukraine for 26 years and owns a company that distributes beauty products.\n\nMany Mexicans who were repatriated this month said the anguish did not end when they reached their homeland. The war accompanies them everywhere. Checking their friends' notifications on social media and watching the news immediately takes them back to the cruelties of war.\n\nManuel González Oscoy, a specialist in clinical psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, explained to Noticias Telemundo that it is normal for people who have just arrived in the country to continue feeling shocked by the updates they receive from Ukraine.\n\n\"These people left everything, from one day to the next, and those losses, in addition to the deaths and the horrors of war, must be processed with professional help,\" González Oscoy said.\n\nGonzález Oscoy did not rule out that, in some cases, the survivors of armed conflicts could develop other conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. Medical advice and treatment are needed for people experiencing recurrent memories, nightmares and episodes of severe emotional distress.\n\n\"The repetition of events, like memories, must be discussed a lot in order to unblock and assimilate them. From a neurochemical perspective, it has been shown that communication helps a lot,\" he said.\n\nRosalía Tovar, 36, who arrived in Mexico on the government evacuation flight said, \"I wake up every morning longing and dreaming of waking up in my bed, in my house in Kyiv and that there is no war.\"\n\nFor Tovar, activism and networking have helped her be resilient and process all the anguish from recent weeks.\n\n\"You have to understand that it's not a vacation. It feels like an exile, and that's why you have to stop thinking like a victim and assume the role of a volunteer,\" she said.\n\nTovar is working with a project to virtually teach kids who are outside the conflict zone. She is also taking part in marches in support of Ukraine.\n\n\"As soon as it is possible,\" Becerra said, \"I will return, and I intend to join society to help as a volunteer in the reconstruction.\"\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "'Tale of two borders': Not many Mexicans are found at busy border crossings\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nYUMA, Ariz.  - As hundreds of migrants line up along an Arizona border wall around 4 a.m., agents try to separate them into groups by nationality.\n\n\"Anyone from Russia or Bangladesh? I need somebody else from Russia here,\" an agent shouts and then says quietly, almost to himself, \"These are Romanian.\"\n\nIt's a routine task for the Border Patrol in the wee hours in this flat expanse of desert where the wall ends. Migrants from at least 115 countries have been stopped here in the last year, but that may be less striking than what's missing: Mexicans are virtually absent.\n\nInstead, families from Venezuela, Colombia, Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, India and dozens of other countries arrive in Yuma after wading through the knee-deep Colorado River. Their presence reflects how a pandemic-era rule still shapes the journeys of many migrants, even though much of the U.S. has moved on from COVID-19.\n\nThe changing demographics mark a dramatic shift away from the recent past, when migrants were predominantly from Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle countries - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. That's especially clear at some of the busiest crossings, like Yuma and Eagle Pass, Texas, near where several people died in recent days while trying to cross the Rio Grande .\n\nMexicans still cross elsewhere but often try to elude capture because they are likely to be expelled under a pandemic rule that denies them a chance to seek asylum.\n\nMexicans still account for 7 of every 10 encounters in the Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector, where smugglers order them to walk at night with black-painted water jugs, camouflage backpacks and boots with carpeted soles to avoid leaving tracks in the sand, said John Modlin, the sector chief.\n\n\"Incredibly different tale of two borders, even though they're within the same state,\" Modlin said.\n\nMigrants who are not from Mexico and the Northern Triangle accounted for 41% of stops on the border from October through July, up from only 12% three years earlier, according to government data .\n\nIn Yuma, they wear sandals and carry shopping bags stuffed with belongings over their shoulders. Some carry toddlers. The migrants typically walk a short distance through tribal lands and surrender to agents, expecting to be released to pursue their immigration cases.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexicans made up 35% of all border encounters from October through July, higher than three years ago but well below the 85% reported in 2011 and the 95% at the turn of the century.\n\nIn theory, the rule that denies migrants the right to seek asylum on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19 applies to all nationalities. But in practice, Title 42 is enforced largely for migrants who are accepted by Mexico, which agreed to take in people expelled from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, as well as its own citizens.\n\nIt is difficult for the U.S. to send others to their home countries due to costs, strained diplomatic relations and other considerations.\n\n\"The challenge is what Mexico can accept,\" Modlin said. \"That's always going to be a limiting factor.\"\n\nIn Yuma, Title 42 has become almost nonexistent , with the pandemic rule being applied in only 192 of 24,424 stops in July - less than 1%. In Tucson, it was used in 71% of stops. A court order has kept Title 42 in place indefinitely.\n\nIt is unclear why routes are so divergent. U.S. officials believe inhospitable mountains and canyons near Tucson favor people trying to escape detection, while the ease of crossing in places like Yuma makes those paths better suited for families seeking to surrender.\n\n\"What we know with absolute certainty is that the smuggling organizations control the flow,\" Modlin said. \"They decide who goes where and when they go to the point. It's almost like air traffic control of moving people around.\"\n\nIn Yuma, groups of up to about two dozen migrants are dropped off by bus or car on a deserted Mexican highway and then begin arriving shortly after midnight at the edge of the imposing wall built during Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nIf English and Spanish fail, agents use Google Translate to question them under generator-powered lights, take photos and load them onto buses.\n\nMigrants arrive over several hours on different paths, sparking concern among agents that smugglers may be trying to confuse them to sneak some through undetected.\n\nOne recent morning, six Russians said they flew from Istanbul to Tijuana, Mexico, with a stop in Cancun, and hired a driver to take them four hours to the deserted highway where they crossed.\n\nA 26-year-old man who flew from his home in Peru to Tijuana said the most difficult part of the journey was the anxiety about whether he'd make it to his destination in New Jersey.\n\nNelson Munera, 40, said he, his wife and their 17-year-old son got off a bus on the highway and crossed to Yuma because fellow Colombians had taken the same route.\n\nLazaro López, who came with his 9-year-old son from Cuba by flying to Nicaragua and crossing Mexico over land, chose Yuma because that's where his smuggler guided him.\n\n\"An opportunity presented itself,\" said Lopez, 48.\n\nThe Border Patrol drops off hundreds of migrants each day at the Regional Center for Border Health, a clinic near Yuma that charters six buses daily to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Migrants are released on humanitarian parole or with a notice to appear in immigration court.\n\nThe clinic began the airport shuttles for migrants in February 2021 and recently added buses to Washington, paid for by the state of Arizona.\n\n\"We have seen families from over 140 countries,\" said Amanda Aguirre, the health-care provider's chief executive officer. \"We haven't seen one from Mexico, not through our processing.\"\n\nThe shift is also evident on the Mexican side of the border.\n\nThe Don Chon migrant shelter in nearby San Luis Rio Colorado fills many of its roughly 50 beds with Central Americans who were expelled under Title 42.\n\nKelvin Zambrano, 33, who arrived in a large group of Hondurans, said he fled threats of extortion and gang violence. Border Patrol agents wouldn't let him share his story, he said.\n\n\"I don't know why, but they don't want Hondurans,\" he said.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram.\n\n‎\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

A picture of the family shared by Customs and Border Protection on Facebook showed a man and woman carrying the baby and a 2-year-old in their arms through snow and ice in the dark of night.\n\nApprehensions in the area where the family was found, known as the Swanton Sector, which includes sections of Vermont, New York and New Hampshire, have increased to 1,146 from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, from just 136 the year prior. Across the northern border, crossings from Canada into the U.S. have increased from 16,000 to 42,000 over the same time period, according to CBP data.\n\nMexicans are by far the leading nationality crossing into the U.S. in the Swanton Sector, followed by Haitians and Guatemalans, according to CBP data.\n\nCBP in the Swanton Sector did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the Biden administration continues to use Covid restrictions, via the Title 42 policy, to block migrants at the southern border, Mexicans at those crossings are turned away more than any other nationality, making up more than 60% of all expulsions.\n\nBut for those who can afford the roughly $350 one-way plane ticket from Mexico to Montreal or Toronto, their prospects of not being sent back under Title 42 are much better. One migrant, whose last name is Cruz and was recently stopped by Border Patrol and named in a court filing, told border agents he and his wife legally entered Canada by flying to Toronto.\n\nThe couple had trouble finding work in Canada, Cruz told border agents, so they attempted to cross to the U.S. before they were apprehended, according to the court filing.\n\nMuch like migrants seeking to cross the southern border, organized criminal organizations play a role in smuggling migrants into Canada as well.\n\nCruz told border agents he wired $1,000 to a man as a deposit for him and his wife to enter the U.S., with the understanding he would pay another $1,000 after crossing. It was his hope that he and his wife would eventually be taken to live and work in New York City, he said, before he was stopped in Derby Line, Vermont, driving with a Chilean national, a man presumed to be the smuggler he paid.\n\n\"This area has been used in the past for human smuggling,\" a border agent testified in court.\n\nBorder officials say they are worried about subzero temperatures that send migrants into hypothermia, especially those with young children.\n\nMore families are crossing with their minor children along the northern border. From Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, 6,709 migrant families with children crossed into the U.S. from Canada, compared to 1,500 during the same time period in 2021. CBP has not yet published data on the number of undocumented migrants who attempted to cross either northern or southern borders in January.\n\nOn the other side of the Vermont border, in the small Quebec town of Saint-Armand, a farmer told NBC News via Instagram that it is not uncommon for locals to see migrants crossing the border in both directions. He said locals know to leave migrants alone when they're seen crossing into the U.S. from Canada.\n\n\"Never give someone a ride to [the] border was what I was told. Let them walk. Which is fine, as it's two minutes,\" said David McMillan, owner of Hayfield Farm, a property less than 1.2 miles from the U.S.-Canada line.\n\nDidi Martinez is a producer with the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\nJulia Ainsley is the homeland security correspondent for NBC News and covers the Department of Homeland Security for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The decrease was the major driver in bringing down the overall population of immigrants in the country illegally. In 2017 it was about 10.5 million - the lowest since 2004. The research group found the peak was in 2007 at about 12.2 million. Previously, Mexican nationals made up most of that population. Now, it's a combination, with Central America having the second-largest, and Asia following with 1.4 million.\n\nPew based the estimates on government data and used a so-called \"residual\" method to determine the estimate. The method is similar to those used by Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics and other groups that track immigration, like the Migration Policy Institute and Center for Migration Studies.\n\nThe method uses U.S. census counts and government surveys to calculate the number of immigrants living in the U.S. in a particular year, followed by immigrant admissions and other official counts. The number of lawful immigrants is subtracted to get the estimate of immigrants here illegally. The estimate includes some 320,000 people with Temporary Protected Status, and about 700,000 beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, two programs ended by Trump that are on hold dude to court challenges.\n\nTheir research found that longterm residents outnumber more recent arrivals. There are also fewer people working who are not legally allowed to be in the country. Five states had increases in the number of people there without legal documentation: Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK , TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM .\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The state has the second-largest number of Mexicans with college degrees, behind California, which has 215,000 with degrees.\n\nAbout 1 in 6 Mexicans in the United States overall had a college degree from 2000 to 2017, up from about 1 in 20 from 1996 to 2000. But highly skilled Mexicans are just 8 percent of the foreign-born population nationally.\n\nThe researchers said that naturalized citizens made up the largest share of Mexican college graduates, but unauthorized immigrants and legal permanent residents also are well represented. Temporary visa holders were a smaller share, but more likely to have a college degree.\n\nThe Trump White House has been working on an immigration plan and one proposal includes provisions to set up a \"merit-based\" system to attract high-skilled immigrants, according to media reports .\n\nOften missing from the conversation about immigration, Selee said, is how highly skilled the immigrant population in the United States is - not just in college education, but also in technical education, high school education and other types of professional certification.\n\nHe said with that reality added to the conversation, a merit-based immigration system, depending on how it is constructed, may not exclude Mexicans and Latin Americans.\n\n\"How it is constructed is key,\" he said.\n\nThis increase in educational attainment comes as Mexican migration has slowed because the country's economy has improved, as the U.S. has hardened its border enforcement and as Mexico's birth rates have dropped.\n\nAriel G. Ruiz Soto, an associate policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute and a co-author of the study, said the updated profile on Mexican immigrants in the U.S. can be important for making sure higher skilled immigrants of Mexican descent are not facing barriers beyond English proficiency to employment matching their skills.\n\nIn Texas, the top five industries for Mexican immigrant adults with a college degree in Houston, Dallas, El Paso, McAllen and San Antonio were elementary and secondary schools; construction; restaurants and food services; hospitals; and colleges and professional schools, including junior colleges.\n\nThose findings suggest significant underemployment for some of the Mexican immigrants, Ruiz Soto said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK , TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM .\n\nSuzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The Siqueiros School is based in a converted elementary school in the nearby hamlet of Poxindeje, and one of its co-founders is Jesús Rodríguez Arévalo, a pupil of disciples of Mexico's three muralism masters: Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and José Clemente Orozco.\n\n\"The school is small, a humble space, but it is very serious and it is professional,\" Rodríguez said.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco also started out at a colonial-era school-turned art laboratory. It was 1922, and they were charged with fulfilling the then-Mexican education minister's mission to take art out of the galleries and into public spaces. The plan, part of a national literacy campaign sponsored by the national government, transformed Mexico and permeated the entire continent.\n\nThe artists' manifesto was to make \"ideological propaganda for the good of the people\" and give art \"a purpose of beauty, of education and combat for all.\"\n\nThey identified with the agrarian and proletarian revolutions and mingled with European artists who fled to Mexico from both world wars. Sponsored by the government, they had access to the country's most majestic buildings and the necessary resources to experiment with new techniques. Eventually, they began to paint in other nations: Argentina, Chile, Cuba and the United States among them.\n\nDespite the backing of Mexican political leaders, their work turned out to be too provocative in some places outside the country: A mural Rivera painted in New York's Rockefeller Center was censured and then demolished because it glorified communism.\n\n\"We are a bit more cowardly,\" said Ernesto Ríos Rocha, 53, a muralist who is currently trying to found Mexico's first muralism university in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa. \"We talk more about peace.\"\n\nThe murals being created in San Salvador and other small towns today still have much in common with those created in the early 20th century, however: They encapsulate themes of war, injustice, and oppression - as well as 21st century issues such as climate change and violence against women.\n\nBut Rodríguez and his students don't anticipate monumental reverberations from their work. Their aspirations are lower and their income more modest, coming mostly from local governments that commission them to paint murals and support from community members who donate meals and house foreign students.\n\nThe Poxindeje school bets on recycling and reusing discarded materials donated by glassmakers or flooring manufacturers, said Janet Calderón, who co-founded the Siqueiros School with Rodríguez five years ago. They're even making murals from garbage.\n\nLuz Asturizaga, a 36-year-old sculptor from Bolivia, has enjoyed every moment of her stay in the iconic home of muralism. She wasn't able to learn much about the art form in her own country, where she said professional artists' circles are very closed. In Mexico, \"they give you opportunity, they teach you,\" she said.\n\nFew students have completed training at the school - about 40 since it opened five years ago - but all leave with clear ideas instilled by their instructors: \"Go to the communities, teach, carry out a comprehensive work of historic themes, of social content, of criticism of everything that oppresses man,\" Rodríguez said.\n\nThe first step for the artists is to decide what elements they want to include, what metaphors to lay out. Then they build a sort of collage of portraits and photographs of historical figures whom they want to immortalize.\n\nComposition and perspective are key. Dressed in paint-splotched jeans, his black hair tied back in a ponytail, the 54-year-old Rodríguez closes one eye in front of the mural in progress in San Salvador, and with the other glances through a transparent sheet of paper containing sketches of figures intended for the wall. The goal is to calculate the right scale, taking into account from where and what distance people will be viewing the work.\n\n\"You have to know local history and then begin with the sketches,\" said Luis Manuel Vélez, 52, a worker for Mexico's national oil company who spends his weekends painting murals.\n\nSometimes models for the work come from the neighborhood. A 6-year-old girl passing by the mural in San Salvador pointed and smiled before exclaiming: \"That's me and my grandpa.\"\n\nPurists have long lamented that starting in the late 20th century, muralism was replaced by urban art or short-lived graffiti.\n\nRíos Rocha agrees, but is still optimistic.\n\n\"Muralism is in intensive care, but it is not going to die,\" he said.\n\nHistorian David Martínez Bourget is a researcher at the 88-year-old Bellas Artes Museum, a palatial art nouveau performing arts center in Mexico City whose interior walls are graced with famous murals by Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco.\n\nMartínez Bourget said the art movement that the fathers of muralism began in the 20th century is over, but its spirit remains - not just in Poxindeje and San Salvador - but also in marginalized Chicano communities in the western United States and in Zapatista villages in southern Mexico. In both places, public art displays capture the communities' history and rebellion, he noted.\n\nAs long as people are fighting for social justice, this kind of artistic expression will exist, Martínez Bourget says, because in difficult moments \"art is politicized.\"\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\n‎\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Under the proposal, all judges â including Supreme Court justices â would be elected.\n\nThe reform is part of a package of constitutional changes to government oversight and watchdog agencies, as well as elections.\n\nElecting judges could bring more political influence into judicial decisions , and potentially ferment polarization and, in turn, mistrust in the system, a columnist at El Economista wrote. By the same token, judges might be elected based on their politics , rather than their judicial acumen, an expert told InfoBae. The elections could also present drug cartels and other crime gangs a â golden opportunity â to finance judgesâ campaigns, a former Mexican lawmaker said on X. âThis is a catastrophic foolishness that progresses despite everyone knowing that itâs a catastrophic foolishness, â a political analyst wrote in Reforma.\n\nMexicoâs outgoing President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ3pez Obrador has argued that judicial reform is necessary to fix the â rotten â system that is âdominated by corruption.â But such accusations by LÃ3pez Obrador have become so frequent as to be âsystematic,â a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers wrote on X and in a letter to the President. The potential âmisuseâ of government communications channels could â lead to harassment and abuse aimed at influencing judicial decisions,â she said, adding that âpublic accusations are not an effective way to fight corruption.â\n\nThe Mexican peso had its biggest drop since the pandemic after Sheinbaumâs election, partly due to investor concern over her proposed slate of constitutional reforms, Bloomberg wrote. The peso lost almost 10% of its pre-election value in the two weeks after the vote, but appeared to plateau as Sheinbaum tried to reassure investors that the countryâs economy is âhealthy and strong,â FXStreet noted. But the tension has not dissipated. âThe market was hoping that she would distance herself from President LÃ3pez Obrador,â an economist told Bloomberg.

Read it now .\n\nDays before leftist Claudia Sheinbaum became the new president of Mexico, another populist leader was sworn in in El Salvador for the second time, right-leaning leader Nayib Bukele.\n\nOn paper, Sheinbaum and Bukele differ greatly in ideology, but their populist politics â promising to put peopleâs livelihoods first â reflect a broad trend in Latin America, where voters are increasingly willing to accept democratic backsliding in exchange for better security against organized crime and economic rejuvenation.\n\nUltimately, Sheinbaum and Bukele join a litany of populist leaders in Latin America âÂ including Javier Milei in Argentina and NicolÃ¡s Maduro in Venezuela âÂ who have taken hold in the region.\n\nBukeleâs policies, like his âiron fistâ approach against gangs, which brought homicides in the country down by 95%, are a source of inspiration for politicians in Latin America , with some describing these successes âa miracle.â Leaders increasingly look to Bukele as a model, Americas Quarterly noted. In PerÃ1, for example, the mayor of Lima, a potential presidential candidate, promised a âBukele planâ to fight crime in the city. âWe have an escalation of what some authors call âpunitive populism,â â a Chilean professor of political science told news podcast Central. But Bukeleâs crackdown on violence came at a cost âÂ the zero-tolerance approach has seen systematic violations of human rights, international watchdogs warned.\n\nSheinbaumâs predecessor and mentor, outgoing President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ3pez Obrador, is known to veer into populist rhetoric bordering on the anti-democratic. Still, he has cultivated huge popularity among the electorate âby giving visibility to poor Mexicans ,â expanding the social welfare program, and increasing the minimum wage (110% in real terms), columnist Juan Pablo Spinetto wrote for Bloomberg. LÃ3pez Obrador has also managed to also get support among more conservative voters, too, such as by not taking a position on abortion and clashing with Mexicoâs feminist movement, according to Americas Quarterly. That has largely subdued a far-right populist rival, and will likely allow Sheinbaum to continue a leftist agenda.\n\nBukeleâs authoritarianism â he described himself as âthe worldâs coolest dictatorâ on social media in 2021 â is just one example of a general backsliding of democracy across Latin America, analysts at The Atlantic Council wrote. Two thirds of the countries in the region are considered âflawed democraciesâ or âhybrid regimesâ that suffer from election fraud and limited press freedom. Other issues, like climate change, food insecurity, and financial stress, could further erode votersâ faith in democratic institutions.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nMexicoâs new President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum is the countryâs first female and Jewish leader, but she is also the first former climate scientist to take charge of the country.\n\nIt is too early to tell to what extent her academic background will guide the countryâs energy and climate policy during Sheinbaumâs presidency, but experts agree that she is inheriting an oil-dependent state that has slowed progress toward its renewable energy goals under her predecessor and mentor, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ3pez Obrador.\n\nThe economic and financial hurdles Sheinbaum has been left to deal with will complicate any ambitions to expand renewable energy and green tech production. With more than $100 billion in debt, Mexicoâs state oil company Pemex âwonât be able to address Mexicoâs needs for cleaner and renewable energiesâ because oil production is the only feasible way to escape that debt, Wilson Center researcher Diego MarroquÃ­n Bitar told Semafor. And though Mexicoâs proximity to the United States could make it ideal as a green tech production hub for the continent, more foreign investment is funneled to countries like Brazil because âMexico does not have the energy to secure these investments,â MarroquÃ­n Bitar said. Domestically, Mexicans frequently experience blackouts, and there is not enough spare energy for semiconductor or EV production.\n\nSheinbaumâs climate research focused on expanding Mexicoâs indigenous communityâs role in the green transition. But whether that background will inform her administration is unclear, experts said. Of particular concern is the YucatÃ¡n Peninsulaâs Tren Maya: LÃ3pez Obradorâs signature rail infrastructure project that saw him restrict journalists and NGOs from investigating the archaeological and ecological impact of construction. Sheinbaum now has a âreally good opportunityâ to do differently, since she is not rushing to finish construction, said the Wilson Centerâs MarroquÃ­n Bitar. But the project is drowning in corruption allegations , linked to both LÃ3pez Obrador and his MORENA party, and it will be âvery hard for Sheinbaum to distance herselfâ from these scandals, Mariana MiguÃ©lez, director of the Khora Institute MÃ©xico, told Semafor.\n\nOutgoing President LÃ3pez Obrador shunned private investment into mining precious materials such as lithium, a key component of electric vehicles, creating â confusion â in the industry and deferring Chinese investments , Reuters reported. Sheinbaum has indicated she will continue favoring state-owned companies, a move that could significantly slow down the countryâs clean energy transition as it is strapped for cash. The United States is also using southern gas export terminals in Mexico as a means to export to Asia , increasing global emissions, the New York Times reported. Whether Mexico moves towards a more climate-friendly energy policy will depend on the USâs own transition and its willingness to work together after the USâ own election in November, MiguÃ©lez, director of the Khora Institute MÃ©xico, told Semafor.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Five hours later, hundreds of people could still be seen outside, while only 300 ballots had been cast.\n\nCabrera attributed the long wait not only to the unprecedented number of non-registered voters, but also to the digital voting machines being used at the consulate, which presents a challenge for seniors.\n\n\"The big problem here is that older people find it a bit difficult to use the technology,\" Cabrera told The Arizona Republic, explaining that casting the vote should only take between 4 and 5 minutes per person and that no technological issues have arisen at the polls. \"However, we are trying to support everyone to make this happen more quickly.\"\n\nBy noon, the line remained just as long, stretching throughout the consulate parking lot. In the immediate vicinity of the building, only a few canopies covered those present from the heat, while others covered themselves with their own umbrellas. Excessive temperatures of up to 101 degrees were expected, which is common for Phoenix in June.\n\nIn Mexico, citizens are able to vote in elections if they hold an active voter registration card, which is very similar to an identification card issued by states in the U.S.\n\nPrior to Sunday's election, Mexican citizens living abroad were asked to register to vote by a February deadline. However, according to Cabrera, INE made plans to allow for many of unregistered voters in the U.S. with an active card to vote in this election.\n\nBut even with those plans, consulates across the U.S., Canada and Spain were seeing unprecedented numbers, the agency said in a Sunday afternoon statement.\n\n\"In cities like Madrid, Los Angeles, Chicago and Phoenix, the large influx of people who wish to vote at the consular headquarters has exceeded expectations,\" the statement reads.\n\nPhoenix was one of 20 locations in the United States chosen as overseas voting centers.\n\nThe ballot boxes at the polling station in Phoenix are electronic and all votes are counted digitally, said polling station president María de la Luz Reyes.\n\nBy 12 p.m., just over 300 votes had been cast - 93 from people registered to vote and 212 from unregistered voters.\n\n\"We have a large influx of unregistered voters,\" said Antonio Lau, head of citizen identification at INE. \"Even people who had never voted are coming here to the consulate to take advantage of their opportunity to vote.\"\n\nInitially, INE had decided to only make 1,000 additional ballots available, but then added 500, in anticipation for the crowd they were seeing Sunday.\n\nThe increase in the number of ballots was based on discussions with people from the community and the decision of the general council, which determined the possible need to receive more voters, in addition to the operational capacity of the polling station. \"Of course, we would like to have a million ballots, however, for operational and logistical reasons... 1,500 extra is already too big an effort,\" Lau said.\n\nAs a comparison, in Mexico City, according to Lau, a large neighborhood receives approximately 1,000 ballots.\n\nApril Elena Peraza Carrillo, who is in Phoenix visiting family from Bahías de Huatulco, Oaxaca, arrived at the consulate at 5 a.m. to make sure she could cast her vote. Seeing how disorganized the line was outside the consulate, Peraza Carrillo and her sister began to help folks find the line and get all information needed to cast their ballot.\n\n\"Many people began to want to pass as disabled and elderly and with three, four family members,\" Peraza Carrillo told La Voz. \"They started fighting at the door and my sister and I started organizing\".\n\nLuis Guzmán lined up at 6:30 a.m. Given a recent operation, he had the opportunity to move to the front of the line in a state of disability and was gearing up to cast his ballot near the entrance of the consulate.\n\n\"This is a disaster,\" Guzmán said, referring to the number of people waiting and the lack of organization that he attributed to the inefficiency of the voting machines.\n\nAccording to Guzmán, the five polling stations present in the consulate were only seeing a rotation of voters every half hour.\n\nEriksen, for her part, was not the only one who arrived the night before. She estimated that about 20 people slept at the consulate.\n\nDespite the long wait, she said she was proud to have been able to exercise her right to vote.\n\n\"For us the vote is very important, it is very important for us to come to vote since we were given the opportunity this year to come to vote here, for that and above all for democracy,\" Eriksen told La Voz. \"It's doing my bit, voting for a great change that we want.\"\n\nAll those who registered before February 25 have their ballot secured, de la Luz Reyes said, and would be able to vote without delays. The remaining unregistered folks who manage to access the building before 5 p.m. will be able to cast their vote until 5:30 p.m.\n\nMexico City correspondent Diana García contributed to this article.\n\nReach La Voz reporter Silvia Solis at silvia.solisgarza@gannett.com ."

Here's why.\n\nSpend a few days anywhere in Mexico - even in a trendy tourist destination - and you'll understand why some Mexicans don't want the Central American migrants, either .\n\nYou'd think the Mexicans, whose compatriots have been migrating to the United States for generations, would appreciate the predicament of the thousands of Central Americans passing through Mexico trying to reach U.S. soil.\n\nBut no.\n\nThe sentiment was unmistakable from everyone I casually asked during my seven-day trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico: We need to take care of our own first.\n\nSounds familiar? It's the same nationalistic sentiment often heard and harshly criticized here in the United States.\n\nMy stay in Puerto Vallarta last week was strictly a family vacation. I didn't introduce myself as a journalist. The housekeepers, taxi drivers, waiters, cooks and bartenders saw us as just another bunch of tourists who contributed to the local economy and helped them keep their low-paying jobs. (They are jobs, after all.)\n\nNone of these workers volunteered their political views unless asked. Perhaps they're trained to keep to themselves or too tired to care or both. We stayed in Nuevo Vallarta, in the Riviera Nayarit, a gorgeous and increasingly trendy coastal tourist spot.\n\nThere was no sight of Central Americans anywhere in the Riviera Nayarit or a few miles to the south in Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco. But anyone curious enough to chat and willing to listen closely to the locals would spot a trend that helps explain why some of them aren't embracing Central American migrants.\n\nThey're desperately poor with no real prospects of getting out of it. Don't call these Mexicans hypocrites - as some here in the United States do - unless you really know their own predicament.\n\nHow can anyone criticize the hotel housekeeper for balking at the notion that Mexico should shelter, feed and provide medical attention to Central American migrants when she has none of that from the government? How can she pay for it with her roughly $6 a day from cleaning an average of 15 rooms per day?\n\nHow can anyone criticize the college-educated sous-chef of a beach resort who also drives an Uber and earns 150 pesos (that's less than $10) per day? Or the indigenous 32-year-old woman selling her handmade arts and crafts at the local plaza or town square for a day's meal?\n\nThey can't possibly earn that little, a friend told me. It's hard to believe, I know. But even the administration of the new socialist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was bragging about the fact that the minimum wage was set to increase by 16% - to $5.10 a day this year.\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nMy family vacation was a blast filled with all sorts of activities, from tequila tasting to snorkeling to kayaking to off-roading to strolling in nearby towns. But I couldn't remain tone-deaf to the workers around us.\n\nIt only takes a few days of listening attentively to grasp the magnitude of these workers' own desperation to escape a country where a corrupt government turns a blind eye to all sorts of wage exploitation. Let's think of that before we call the Mexicans hypocrites who don't want the Central American migrants to stay in Mexico.\n\nElvia Díaz is an editorial columnist for The Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared.

      "text": "Hundreds of Mexicans deported daily to Nogales after Biden's executive action\n\nAdvocates are seeing hundreds of Mexican families deported daily to Mexico because their requests for asylum are being denied by U.S. Border Patrol agents after President Joe Biden's recent rule restricting asylum in between border crossings.\n\nAround 200 Mexican nationals, mostly families with young children and many of whom are escaping violence and persecution, are being deported daily to Mexico, said Pedro De Velasco, the director of education and advocacy for the Nogales-based Kino Border Initiative.\n\nMigrants told the Kino Border Initiative they tried to surrender to U.S. Border Patrol agents to seek asylum, but their requests were ignored.\n\n\"Even after they explained to the Border Patrol agents ... they are fleeing from violence and persecution, or explicitly asking for asylum, they're being summarily ignored and deported to Mexico,\" De Velasco said.\n\nThat goes against the order that still allows people facing persecution or who show an intention to apply for asylum to take a credible fear test, he said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the president's executive action allows \"noncitizens\" who cross the southern border and are processed for expedited removal to be referred for a credible fear screening with an asylum officer if they express a fear of returning to their country or country of removal, fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum.\n\n\"Not everybody has a valid asylum claim, but even if one person is fleeing violence or persecution, that's enough to ask that Border Patrol listens to every single one of them,\" De Velasco said. \"You cannot ignore them all, because the risk is that you're sending somebody to danger or you're sending somebody to death.\"\n\nBiden released a proclamation on June 4 to allow the U.S. Border Patrol to shut down all asylum processing under sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act when the number of migrant crossings in between the ports of entry exceeds 2,500 per day over a seven-day period.\n\nProcessing would resume when the number of migrant crossings falls below 1,500 per day over a seven-day period. The order would not impact asylum processing at legal border crossings.\n\nThe executive action prohibits migrants who cross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization from being eligible for asylum \" absent exceptionally compelling circumstances. \"\n\nCompelling circumstances include an acute medical emergency, an imminent threat to life or safety, and a victim of human trafficking.\n\nThe new rule also requires migrants who want to claim asylum to apply for entry through one of 1,500 daily appointments border wide made available at the CBP One mobile app.\n\nHowever, people scheduling appointments with immigration officers through the app often have to wait months for an appointment if they are lucky enough to get one, with the average person waiting four months or more for an appointment, De Velasco said.\n\nFollowing the president's executive action, that wait could get longer. De Velasco said before the executive order came out, some walk-in appointments were processed, but now everyone must apply through the app. Border officials have not increased the number of appointments available.\n\nThe executive action has resulted in a surge in the number of Mexicans arriving daily at the repatriation office in Nogales, Sonora. The high number of arrivals means some people are forced to wait outside in 95-degree heat until they can be seen. De Velasco said at any given time there are about 50 people in the repatriation office and 20 people waiting outside in the blistering heat.\n\nThe recent numbers of people returned to Mexico are significantly higher than they were before Biden's executive action. The most recent data from the Mexican government shows the number of migrants returned to Mexico through the DeConcini Port of Entry in Nogales reached 2,607 in January; 2,914 in February; 3,234 in March; and 3,517 in April.\n\nAnother change following the new rule is the lack of offering a voluntary return rather than deportation, De Velasco said. The option of voluntary departure allows people to leave without formal removal proceedings or deportation charges. Deportation bars migrants from returning to the U.S. for at least five years and could result in criminal prosecution.\n\n\"We are talking about Mexican nationals who are stuck in the same country they are trying to flee from,\" he said. \"They are being returned to the same country, returned to that same danger. \"\n\nOn Wednesday, immigrants' rights groups announced their intention to sue the Biden administration over the new rule, saying it puts thousands of lives at risk.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and several other groups filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.\n\nThe groups argue the rule effectively shuts off access to asylum protections for the majority of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, \"no matter how strong their claims,\" the groups wrote in a press release. They compared the new rule to the asylum entry ban erected under former president Donald Trump's Administration.\n\nThe groups also contend the rule is inconsistent with the asylum statute enacted by Congress, which permits migrants to apply for asylum whether or not they enter at a port of entry.\n\n\"Around the world, people are fleeing persecution and torture at higher rates than ever before,\" said Keren Zwick, the litigation director for the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"It's shameful that the U.S. government has chosen to respond by shutting out access to asylum to those who come to our border in need.\"\n\nBiden invited numerous border town officials to attend his announcement on June 4 in Washington D.C. One of the attendees was Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors member Manny Ruiz.\n\nAfter the announcement, he and the Board of Supervisors thanked Biden.\n\n\"These actions will provide relief to our border community by limiting the overflow of migrants and supporting our agents of the Border Patrol,\" Ruiz said in a written statement.\n\nRuiz's statement on the new rule reflects similar sentiments that other border town officials have expressed but is in contrast to the reactions of progressive legislators and advocates .\n\nRuiz told The Arizona Republic that Biden's action was precipitated by actions taken by former President Donald Trump to kill a \"good\" bill that garnered bipartisan support and provided more assistance to border communities. He called on Congress to work on and fix the country's \"broken immigration system.\"\n\nAs more people are deported to Nogales, De Velasco reiterated that the Kino Border Initiative is prepared and ready to help welcome migrants back to Mexico, offer them support and help those who want to stay in Nogales integrate into the community.\n\n\"We're up for this. We're ready for this. We simply ask for people's support and for the government to do their part,\" De Velasco said.\n\nReach the reporter at sarah.lapidus@gannett.com .

      "text": "Mexico prepares tents in border cities to receive Mexicans deported from US\n\nThe construction of large tent shelters is underway in Juárez as part of the Mexican government's preparation for the possible influx of Mexican nationals deported under U.S. President Donald Trump's planned mass deportations.\n\nConstruction of the temporary shelters began on Tuesday, Jan. 21, with state workers laying down the scaffolding for the structures just across the Rio Grande from El Paso. By Thursday morning, the structures were taking shape.\n\nTemporary structures like the one in Juárez are being prepared in nine Mexico cities along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThey are part of the President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo administration's \"Mexico embraces you\" program, which is preparing to receive those deported by the Trump administration. The plan was announced on Jan. 20, just ahead of the presidential inauguration in the U.S.\n\nThe facilities are quickly going up in preparation of any possible mass deportation from the United States.\n\n\"There are two that will be finished tonight,\" Sheinbaum Pardo said Thursday as she started her morning news conference. \"The others will likely be finished by Saturday.\"\n\nThe center is being constructed on the land known locally as El Punto, just east of the Paso del Norte border crossing. The site is known as the place Pope Francis visited during in 2016.\n\nThe tents are being prepared to provide potable water, garbage collection, and generators, according to a government news release detailing the facilities. These shelters will provide Mexican nationals deported with temporary housing, food, medical care, telephones, and assistance with job placement.\n\nThe program also makes 189 buses available to assist deportees with transportation to their home towns.\n\nThe shelters will be used exclusively to receive Mexicans, Enrique Serrano, the head of the Chihuahua state agency State Population Council (COESPO) and former mayor of Juárez, said.\n\n\"Foreign nationals will be attended by the National Institute of Migration,\" Serrano said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump Monday closed the CBP One app , which during the Biden administration permitted a daily limit of migrants to legally enter the U.S. to petition for asylum.\n\nThe following day the administration announced that it would be re-activating the Migration Protection Protocols (MPP) , a policy from Trump's first administration that required non-Mexican asylum seeker to wait in Mexico as their cases advanced in the U.S.\n\nMexico must approve the re-implementation of the policy before any migrants awaiting asylum are returned to Mexico. President Sheinbaum Pardo has signaled that she is likely to accept the policy, which is also known as \"Remain in Mexico.\"\n\nWhile the shelters in Juárez will not provide services to non-Mexican migrants, there are at least three federally run shelters in the border city that provide humanitarian services to migrants. President Sheinbaum Pardo stated Jan. 21 that Mexico would continue to provide humanitarian aid to migrants from other countries who are at the border waiting in Mexico.\n\n\"There is humanitarian aid for them if they arrive to our northern border,\" Sheinbaum Pardo said. \"Yesterday it was -7°C (19°F) in Chihuahua. How can any government leave someone in those temperatures?\"\n\nMexico also promised to help any migrants return to their home countries.\n\nThe number of migrants arriving to the border in El Paso are at historically low levels , with the El Paso Sector seeing a 63% drop in Border Patrol encounters, according to Customs and Border Protection data. This decrease is in part the result of Mexican policy that keeps migrants near the border with Guatemala from traveling north.\n\nJeff Abbott covers the border for the El Paso Times and can be reached at: jdabbott@gannett.com ; @palabrasdeabajo on Twitter or@palabrasdeabajo.bsky.social on Bluesky."

      "text": "This is America: Spanish is the language of my culture. I don't speak it, and it haunts me.\n\nSpanish is the language of my family and culture. It hurts not knowing it.\n\nI was finally having my \"Selena\" moment.\n\nNo, it wasn't me performing in front of tens of thousands of fans or about to win a Grammy Award. It was me, in a crowd full of people I identify with culturally, unable to speak Spanish to those who would expect me to.\n\nOf all the iconic scenes from the hit 1997 biopic of Selena Quintanilla Pérez, there are two that stick out to me: when there is concern of her performing in Mexico because she doesn't speak Spanish, and when her father, played by Edward James Olmos, explains why it feels risky for them to go.\n\n\"Down there, you got to speak perfectly, or the press will eat you up and spit you out alive,\" he says. \"We got to prove to the Mexicans how Mexican we are, and we got to prove to the Americans how American we are. We got to be more Mexican than the Mexicans, and more American than the Americans, both at the same time. It's exhausting.\"\n\nI normally love going to cover in-person events, but this was the first one I felt nervous about. It was a press conference for the Mexico National Football Team, where players and managers would be speaking Spanish. Luckily, English interpretation was offered for the media, and some players even answered in English, but I felt embarrassed.\n\nI felt like a fraud - in an area where most people looked like me.\n\nMy name is Jordan Mendoza, a trending news reporter at USA TODAY, and one of the few nearly full-Hispanic people that don't know how to speak Spanish.\n\nAs I got older, I started to realize I was missing out. I couldn't be involved in conversations. I couldn't understand Mexican pop culture and jokes that everyone found funny left me confused. I avoided all conversations that could be in Spanish because I wanted to avoid looking like a fool.\n\nThis is something that has plagued me most of my life. I've always known I wouldn't be fully accepted into American culture because of my background, but I've always felt like an outsider among people from the same background as me because I can't speak Spanish. I even took Spanish all of high school in hopes of getting better, but I still struggled. I have fears of learning Spanish now because I think it'll only make things worse since I won't sound as natural as someone who grew up learning it.\n\nHowever, I know I am not alone.\n\nA Pew Research Center analysis from 2015 found 97% of Latinx immigrant parents speak to their children in Spanish, but that drops to 71% among U.S. born second-generation Latinx parents. My grandma, born in Mexico, taught my dad and his four siblings Spanish, but my dad didn't teach me. My mom was never taught Spanish by her grandparents. The most exposure I got was my grandma speaking some Spanglish to me, and me responding in English.\n\nIt's a tough thing to figure out; how can I say I'm Mexican and proud of it when I can't even speak the language my family, friends and colleagues do?\n\nEven though I still struggle with my imposter syndrome, I try not to let my language deficiencies define who I am.\n\nI still observe Mexican holidays, and I make it a point to have my Hispanic culture be included in USA TODAY coverage, from Día de la Independencia to Nochebuena . Hispanic families are known to be massive, and I make sure to stay involved and see as much of my family as I can. And if there is something, or someone, bringing our culture to mainstream media, you best believe I won't shut up about it.\n\nWhile I try not to let this define who I am, what I do ask from my community is to be more sympathetic toward those like me. I can't count the number of times I've been met with negative reactions from others for saying \"no hablo español\" or responding in English. Sadly, there are derogatory terms for people like me.\n\nI know I'm not as Mexican or Hispanic as I could be, and I'm trying to teach myself to be okay with it; what I lack in language, I make up in pride and knowledge. Sure, my dad didn't teach me Spanish, but the most valuable thing he taught me was to be proud of my heritage and to never forget my roots.\n\nIt'll never be easy to accept, but I feel lucky to be Mexican-American and have such a rich culture for me to share with everyone, and I encourage everyone to immerse themselves in it.\n\nI am proud of my background, proud of my culture and proud I am able to showcase it here at USA TODAY as I continue to learn more about myself, while celebrating all the fantastic work of Hispanic Heritage Month.

      "text": "As Trump plans mass deportation, Mexican views of migration harden\n\nMarta Castillo is angry about immigration. There are too many migrants in her town, she said, and they don't speak the language.\n\n\"We've been invaded,\" she said, standing outside a restaurant where she works. \"I changed my opinion (about them), because I live in a place where we didn't see any of this. But now everywhere there are people who aren't from here.\"\n\nCastillo is Mexican. She lives in Mexico. Like a growing number of her fellow citizens, she has become increasingly negative about the migrants who have poured into her community - despite living in a country where millions of people have ties to someone who migrated to the United States.\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, he is demanding Mexico do more to crack down on the tens of thousands of migrants in Mexico who are headed for the U.S. border. He may find support in an unlikely corner ‒ among Mexicans themselves.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that most Mexicans could say they had family or a friend who had gone to \"El Norte\" to work or escape violence and insecurity. But the changing demographics of migration - first the rise in the number of Central Americans, then Haitians, then Venezuelans, then people from all over the globe - has hardened some Mexicans' views.\n\nSeven in 10 Mexicans believe migrant flows into their country are \"excessive,\" according to a survey by the nonprofit Oxfam Mexico published in 2023. More than half of respondents said they believe migration has a negative or no positive impact on the economy or culture, and 40% say migration in Mexico should be limited or prohibited.\n\nThe budding anti-migrant sentiment has led to occasional flare-ups of protest or violence and prompted the United Nations refugee agency to conduct its own poll of public views on migration in Mexico.\n\nThat survey, published in October, found nearly a third of respondents believed migrants should be allowed only to transit rapidly through Mexico to the U.S., while 13% believed their border should be closed and migrants deported. By contrast, in the United States, 55% of respondents in a Gallup poll in June said they want to see immigration decreased.\n\nIn Mexico, \"among the general public, the idea of diversity hasn't been normalized,\" said Emilio Gonzalez Gonzalez, a senior assistant for migrant protection at the United Nations refugee agency in Mexico City, known as ACNUR. \"There are stereotypes and stigmas.\"\n\nMigration to the U.S. has been a tradition in Mexico.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended Mexican nationals more than half a million times in each of the past two years; they remain the single largest nationality encountered at the border.\n\nBut at home, Mexicans are increasingly facing immigration concerns similar to those seen in the United States. They're wrestling with questions like how to accommodate and provide for people arriving with few resources and who don't speak Spanish.\n\nIn recent years, a tent city has flourished in a stone-floored plaza in the heart of Mexico City's historic center. In late September, migrants battled rain and filth from their camping tents and makeshift lean-tos. Many were waiting for appointments at the U.S. border or to chance an illegal crossing, evading Mexican authorities on routes north.\n\nVenezuelans waited in line for a free breakfast served inside a cavernous Catholic church. Haitians speaking Creole washed their children in the street. A French-speaking Angolan woman tended a chicken boiling over an open fire.\n\nThe Mexican neighbors who live near the plaza have grown frustrated. Anger boiled over in February, when local media reported police responded to a physical altercation between locals and Haitians in which two people were injured.\n\nNegative views in Mexico tend to be stoked by proximity, especially when large numbers of people take up in encampments, said Tony Payan, executive director of the Center for the U.S. and Mexico at Rice University.\n\nPeople generally support migration \"if immigrants are in a shelter locked away and don't affect their day-to-day,\" he said. \"As soon as they feel there is interference with their daily activities, then the underlying racism, prejudice and xenophobia become apparent.\"\n\nTen blocks west of the tent city, tourists bustled through the city's Zocalo public square, marveling at the grand cathedral and the ruins of an Aztec temple.\n\nCastillo, the restaurant worker, stood on a corner hawking breakfast and the restaurant's fourth-story view. She lives in a suburb of the city, she said, where hundreds of migrants have arrived in recent months.\n\n\"I understand and comprehend that in the country they came from they're going through a difficult situation, but everyone should resolve their problems in their own country,\" she said.\n\nRaul Priviesca Zara expressed similar concerns. At a newsstand in a nearby shopping district, the 71-year-old Mexico City resident said he worries - as many Americans do - that migrants bring crime.\n\n\"There are many Venezuelans and Cubans who come here to steal, to make their mafia,\" he said as he looked over the day's headlines. \"We're giving them asylum and refuge so they can steal from our people. I agree that we should help people, just not those who come to steal or do crime - and the majority come for that.\"\n\nAccording to the United Nations refugee agency, migrants in Mexico commit crimes at lower rates than the general population, just as they do in the United States . In Mexico, migrants are more likely to be victims of crime, preyed upon by smugglers and corrupt authorities alike.\n\nThe agency's survey of Mexican perceptions showed 85% of respondents believe people migrate for economic reasons. Meanwhile, more than half of migrants themselves, responding to United Nations' surveys, say they are fleeing violence or insecurity, Gonzalez Gonzalez said.\n\nAmong the Mexicans polled, \"few understand that migrants arrive fleeing violence,\" he said, even though Mexican migrants also have fled to the U.S. to escape violence tied to organized crime.\n\nAlexandra Haas, now executive director of Oxfam Mexico, has followed the evolving patterns of migration for more than a decade. Beginning with the migrant caravans in 2018, Haas began to note a shift in public opinion - a spate of angry protests in Tijuana in the north, outbreaks of violence in the southern city of Palenque. Still, there were contradictions.\n\n\"I could see expressions of solidarity, people leaving clothes and food,\" she said. \"But on the other hand, in some cities migrants faced some rejection. I thought we didn't really know what the Mexican public thought of migration.\"\n\nOxfam launched a survey in 2022 and a research project that included evaluating more than 48,000 social media posts that mentioned migrants or migration.\n\nOne of the messages that emerged, Haas said, is that Mexicans \"are not so much preoccupied with migration but with the lack of capacity by Mexican institutions to deal with problems\" that can come with it.\n\nThe other finding, according to the Oxfam report, was that Mexico's immigration policies \"based on repression, containment and deportation ... have steered the public conversation toward racist, classist and xenophobic discourse.\"\n\nMexico's laws provide ample protections for migrants. The country has its own refugee agency that processes asylum claims . But in practice - under pressure from the United States - Mexico is increasingly leaning on U.S.-style enforcement, including blocking migrants from traveling north and curbing access to asylum.\n\nMexico has \"accepted a de facto outsourcing of U.S. enforcement-driven migration policies,\" said Arturo Sarukhan, former Mexican ambassador to the U.S.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry reported more than 925,000 migrant encounters in the first eight months of 2024, more than double the 440,000 encounters registered in 2022.\n\nThe surging number of migrant encounters reflects, in part, Mexico's policy of apprehending migrants on routes north and transporting them back south multiple times. At the same time, the country's refugee agency, known as COMAR, is processing far fewer applications for lawful refugee status, less than half the rate of a year ago.\n\nMexico stepped up its immigration enforcement earlier this year after the U.S. saw record-breaking crossings in December 2023, and the Biden-Harris administration asked for more enforcement.\n\nU.S. State Department officials told USA TODAY in September that Mexico agreed to harden its enforcement of migrant routes north, \"not just out of the kindness of their hearts, but also recognizing this was an important challenge to them,\" the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak freely about the bilateral discussions.\n\nThe quiet shift in Mexico, from broad acceptance of migration to an increasingly negative view, echoes a similar shift in the United States, where more than 76 million people voted for Trump, who has promised a \"mass deportation\" of immigrants living in the U.S. without permission.\n\nMexico could now face the prospect of millions of its own people being deported.\n\nAt the high point of Mexican migration in 2007, nearly 7 million Mexicans - roughly 7% of Mexico's population - were living unlawfully in the United States, according Pew Research and Mexico's INEGI census agency. Today, according to Pew, roughly 4 million Mexicans live illegally in the U.S.\n\nThen, \"almost everybody in Mexico had a friend or relative who had migrated (to the U.S.),\" said Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the nonprofit Washington Office on Latin America. \"They would view migrants as brothers, 'just like us.' Now when you hear somebody talking that way, it's a throwback.\"\n\nMany Mexicans do remember their close connections to migration.\n\nOutside the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, a family - father, mother and their toddler daughter - strolled along the tree-shaded Reforma boulevard. They were killing time before their appointment to request a travel visa to the United States and were in town from Michoacan, a state in southern Mexico where migrating to work in the U.S. has been a tradition going back decades.\n\n\"People simply go in search of better opportunities,\" said Ernesto Anguiano Ayala, who said he has family in California. \"I don't know if it's good or bad. But people go there for a better life, for their babies.\"\n\n\"Just like others have a right to look for a better future here in Mexico, maybe one day we'll want to look for a better life in another place, too,\" said Jessica Hernandez, holding their young daughter. \"So there should be equality.\"\n\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com."

      "text": "Opinion: All Latinos, not just immigrants, should fear Donald Trump's mass deportation vow\n\nImmigration is the defining issue for Donald Trump. Latino immigrants are the main target.\n\nBut all of us Latinos/Hispanics will be affected when Trump brings back the 1954 Eisenhower \"Operation Wetback\" raids where Mexican immigrants, and even Mexican Americans, were brutally rounded up and sent to Mexico. Trump has publicly praised Eisenhower and proclaims that his militaristic removal of unauthorized immigrants will be the largest in American history. If you research Eisenhower's \"Operation Wetback,\" you will learn that millions of Mexicans and many American Hispanic citizens were sent to Mexico under barbarous processes.\n\nTrump wants to conduct massive raids of churches, schools, hospitals, construction sites, farms, restaurants or other places where Hispanics congregate. He will use the military and \"deputize\" local law enforcement personnel to conduct these roundups. If you cannot prove citizenship, you will be placed in \"open air\" detention camps awaiting deportation. (Project 2025).\n\nIncredibly, many Latinos are voting for Trump, either agreeing with his \"roundup\" policy or believing it won't affect them. Really? What will stop an armed military trooper from accosting your grandmother, uncle, nephew or other relative and asking them for proof of citizenship? Under \"Operation Wetback,\" both Mexicans and American Latinos were asked for birth certificates because driver licenses and Social Security cards were held by many undocumented individuals and not deemed sufficient evidence of legal citizenship. That's still the case today.\n\nDo you want your friends and relatives exposed to this abuse? Think of the families you know which will be destroyed. Focus on the half a million DACA \"Dreamers\" who have been \"Americanized\" and are now working to strengthen our economy but who will be uprooted.\n\nIf you are worried about increased food, gas, or other service costs, you will be paying higher prices when millions of workers in agriculture, dairy, energy or construction are rounded up and deported. And the nearly $100 billion in federal, state and local taxes paid by undocumented workers will evaporate and guess who will fill the gap. A recent CBS News analysis concluded that that a mass deportation could cost $14.6-$19.6 billion for every million individuals deported or $40-$54 billion to deport 11 million undocumented migrants. Those are your tax dollars which could be invested in education or other more urgent needs.\n\nWhether you are a Latino/Hispanic like me (with my family's centuries-old presence in these lands) or a first- or second-generation American Latino, we will be under attack as never before. The recent verbal assault by an Anglo individual yelling epithets at me and telling me to \"go back to Mexico\" or the racially motivated Walmart slaughter of Hispanics in El Paso, will pale in comparison to what Trump will do. In this poisonous environment, Latinos will be attacked for speaking Spanish in public. Employers will be reluctant to hire someone \"appearing\" to be an immigrant. A pall of discrimination, hate and worry will fall on brown-skinned Americans. According to Trump, brown- skinned immigrants are \"rapists and killers\" and \"poisoning the blood of America.\" And many believe him.\n\nI know that my friends and relatives along the Texas-Mexico border are frustrated with the surge of migrants crossing the Brownsville, Laredo and El Paso borders. I know because I was born in Laredo, grew up in Brownsville and practiced law in El Paso. I have many friends and relatives living along the border. But another \"Operation Wetback\" is not the answer. Do my fellow Latinos/Hispanics want to see their family members stopped randomly on the streets or as they emerge from church or work or a restaurant and asked by an armed official for proof of citizenship? Will there be physical resistance or confrontations?\n\nThe real solution to our immigration problem is updating our immigration laws just as a group of bipartisan Congressmen tried to do this year - until Trump killed the bill. The last time Congress dramatically amended our immigration laws was in 1986 when President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. It provided fines and jail terms for employers who violated the law and offered amnesty for several million individuals who had lived in the U.S. for four years. That law is 38 years old and obviously must be reformed as the Biden/Harris administration has tried to do.\n\nMy message to fellow Latinos/Hispanics: Don't be naive about Donald Trump's \"Operation Wetback\" and live to regret it.\n\nPeña served in two cabinet positions under President Bill Clinton, in Transportation and Energy, and is the former mayor of Denver."

Why not the same outrage?\n\nComedian George Lopez cracked jokes about Mexicans during a campaign rally for Kamala Harris in Phoenix last Saturday, but his comments didn't cause the same political backlash as jokes about Puerto Rico and Latinos made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at a Donald Trump rally in New York the same weekend.\n\nSome Trump supporters are calling the muted reaction generated by the Lopez jokes compared to the outrage ignited by the Hinchliffe comments a double standard. Others point out there is a difference between a Latino making jokes about his own people and a non-Latino making jokes that sound more like hate speech.\n\nAt the campaign rally for Harris at Trevor G. Browne High School in a predominantly Latino area on the west side of Phoenix, Lopez suggested Mexicans might steal materials before Trump had a chance to build his promised border wall.\n\n\"Enough lies,\" Lopez said . \"Donald Trump said he was going to build the wall, and George Lopez said, 'You better build it in one day because if you leave that material out there overnight.'\" Lopez then looked around the stage dramatically as if to suggest the materials had been stolen.\n\nLopez, who is of Mexican descent, followed up with a second joke suggesting Mexicans are poor at math.\n\nTrump \"also said he was going to get Mexico to pay for the wall,\" Lopez said. \"I wish he would have asked me. We can't even split a check at a restaurant, but you know.\"\n\nThe diverse crowd appeared to laugh at both jokes before Lopez went on to declare his support for Harris, calling her \"the real deal.\"\n\nIn contrast, Hinchliffe made several jokes about Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, and Latinos at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday that ignited an immediate political backlash that some say could cost Trump votes among Puerto Rican and Latino voters considered crucial to winning battleground states with large Latino populations, such as Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\n\"There is literally a floating island of garbage floating in the ocean right now,\" Hinchcliffe joked. \"I think it's called Puerto Rico.\"\n\nHinchcliffe also joked that \"Latinos love making babies\" and that he welcomes migrants to the U.S. \"with open arms, and by open arms, I mean like this.\" Hinchcliffe then waved his hands while mouthing the words, \"No. No. Go back.\"\n\nGrammy-winning singer Bad Bunny announced his support for Haris in response to Hinchcliffe's jokes about Puerto Rico, and several other high-profile Puerto Ricans also have expressed their outrage.\n\n\"Thankfully, my sweet abuelita wasn't here to hear that disgusting remark. But if she was alive today, I think she would say, 'Tony Hinchcliffe, go (expletive) yourself,'\" said actor Aubrey Plaza at the Wall Street Journal Magazine 2024 Innovator Awards event on Wednesday in New York City.\n\nThe Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Hinchliffe's comments following the uproar that has included protests by Puerto Rican supporters in Philadelphia, New York and Chicago.\n\n\"It was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste. Obviously, that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign,\" Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on the program, \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nBut some Trump supporters see a double standard.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Gretchen Patterson, 59, a Phoenix resident who was born and raised in Puerto Rico.\n\nPatterson, who identifies as conservative and cast an early ballot for Trump-Vance, said she was not offended by Hinchliffe's joke about Puerto Rico. She believes the comments have been misinterpreted and blown out of proportion.\n\nHinchliffe, Patterson said she believes, was referring to Puerto Rico's mounting trash crisis caused by dwindling landfill space, not the Puerto Rican people.\n\n\"The joke was not about the people. The joke was about the garbage issue the island has,\" Patterson said. She's glad Hinchcliffe's comments are drawing attention to the trash issue and some of the other problems the island is facing.\n\n\"Do you want to get offended, or do you want to say, 'Good, shed some light and let's figure it out what we need ... to rectify the problem that is happening right now ,'\" Patterson said.\n\nShe also wondered why so many people were offended by Hinchliffe's jokes at a Trump rally and not by Lopez's jokes at a Harris rally.\n\nIf people were offended by Hinchcliffe's jokes, they should also be offended by Lopez's comments, regardless of whether one is Latino and the other is not, she said.\n\n\"It's either all of it is wrong, or none of it is,\" Patterson said. \"Because what Lopez implied is that Mexicans are thieves, and that is an insult to the Mexican community because that is not true. I know some of the most honest people in the Mexican community, so to call everybody thieves is just not right.\"\n\nFrancisco Pedraza, a politics professor and associate director of the Center for Latina/os and American Politics Research at Arizona State University, said he does not believe the jokes are comparable because Lopez was using humor to unify people while Hinchliffe was using humor to divide.\n\n\"George Lopez is not cracking his jokes to define who belongs in America,\" Pedraza said. \"He's saying you are a part of the American polity. Be better.\" Whereas the spirit of Tony Hinchcliffe, he said, paired with Trump's negative comments about immigrants, is disparaging towards Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican-Americans. \"The undertone is we don't want you here. That's the difference. \"\n\nThat is why Lopez's jokes about Mexicans didn't elicit the same political backlash as the jokes about Puerto Rico and Latinos by Hinchcliffe, Pedraza said.\n\n\"George Lopez, he is delivering these jokes from a place that clearly he's signaled is out of love, respect and compassion for his community,\" Pedraza said.\n\nThe Trump campaign understands that Hinchcliffe's comments are likely to cost Trump votes and that is why the campaign has tried to distance themselves from the comments, Pedraza said.\n\n\"They know that it comes from a place where the aim is to exclude these people on the basis of a trait or a feature that is out of their control,\" Pedraza said. \"It's not equivalent.\"\n\nCésar Fierros, communications director at Living United for Change in Arizona, an advocacy group that works to increase voter participation by Latinos, said he does not believe Lopez's jokes will hurt the Harris campaign.\n\n\"If anything using Lopez as a surrogate is a great way to connect with Latino voters in AZ that adore his comedy, especially among older Latino voters,\" Fierros said in an email.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Fierros said, \"Hinchcliffe's comments explicitly targeted a community in a way that left an arena full of Trump supporters shocked, not amused. His words were unmistakably aimed at Puerto Ricans, and the audience's reaction was an audible gasp rather than laughter. I think that reflects how off-base and offensive it was.\"\n\nSome voter campaigns are already using Hinchcliffe's comments to try and erode Trump's support among Latino males , who prefer Trump at higher rates than Latinos in general.\n\nThe Working Families Party plans to send 100,000 text messages on Thursday aimed at Latino males, said Matthew Marquez, the group's Arizona campaign director.\n\n\"We're going to shine some light on what was said around Puerto Rico,\" Marquez said. \"If he attacks one Latino community, he is essentially attacking all our Latino communities.\"\n\nStill, some Latinos were put off by Lopez's jokes about Mexicans.\n\n\"It's never a good idea to reinforce stereotypes - no matter who delivers the punchline,\" said Phoenix City Councilman Carlos Galindo-Elvira, who has attended Harris campaign events. \"The consequences of the presidential election are far too serious for Latinos and all Americans.\"\n\nJoe Garcia, executive director of the Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund, a nonprofit political advocacy group, said the attention being placed on jokes by comedians is distracting from larger issues that will impact Latinos.\n\n\"It's a sad state of affairs when we are looking at what comedians have to say in determining who we should vote for as the leader of the free world,\" Garcia said. \"Rather than focusing on humor, or even inappropriate humor, we should focus instead on what is being said by the candidates themselves.\"\n\nFor instance, Garcia said, Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation in the nation's history.\n\n\"I don't think he's joking, I don't think he's kidding when he says that,\" Garcia said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nReporter Stephanie Murray contributed.\n\nReach the reporter at daniel.gonzalez@arizonarepublic.com ."

      "text": "Mexico has a new president, Claudia Sheinbaum. What does it mean for the United States?\n\nWhen Mexicans elected a new president, they also chose the next negotiator-in-chief who will make tough choices with the United States on issues from immigration and trade to fentanyl trafficking .\n\nMexicans voted overwhelmingly for Claudia Sheinbaum, giving her more than 58% of the vote and a substantial mandate to govern the second-largest economy in Latin America and the No. 1 trading partner for the United States.\n\nWhen President Andrés Manuel López Obrador leaves his post and Sheinbaum takes office on Oct. 1, she'll inherit a country that is reeling from slow economic growth and violence linked to organized crime . She'll also face a fractured relationship with the United States. Despite deep cross-border economic ties, the U.S.-Mexico relationship has been tested by the countries' shared problems with global migration and drug trafficking .\n\n\"The two countries have been suffering from an incredible fumbling of the ball in dealing with each other,\" said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the U.S. and Mexico at Rice University's Baker Institute. \"I think the two countries need to come back to the table.\"\n\nAmericans may love \"taco Tuesday\" and vacationing in Cancun, but the complexity of the U.S.-Mexico relationship is often lost amid marketing and political rhetoric. Mexico's stamp on the U.S. is everywhere.\n\nIt's in the Mexico-made car parts that keep U.S. autoworkers employed in Detroit , in the windmill blades exported to U.S. clean energy plants , in the pacemakers saving the lives of American patients with heart failure, and in the $15 avocado toast on restaurant menus nationwide.\n\nU.S. exports to Mexico include grains grown in the Midwest and natural gas pumped in Texas. Mexico sends fruits and vegetables north, keeping grocery costs lower amid volatile inflation in the U.S.\n\nThe country became the United States' largest trading partner last year, pushing China to the No. 2 spot, and the two neighbors now do nearly $800 billion in trade annually , according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut it's a fraught relationship. Mexico is also the transit country for hundreds of thousands of U.S.-bound migrants, provoking repeated humanitarian crises at the U.S. border. And it's the source country for the fentanyl that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico-Canada foreign trade agreement, known as the USMCA - negotiated during the Trump administration - is up for renegotiation in 2026. U.S.-based business leaders are concerned that renegotiating the deal could create uncertainty and hurt both countries' economies.\n\n\"Mexico is now the U.S.'s main trading partner,\" said Jennifer Apperti, director of the Texas-Mexico Center at Southern Methodist University. \"To again reopen the door to things that have just been negotiated would be, honestly, not the best use of time. And business time is of the essence.\"\n\nDomingo Garcia, president of the U.S.-based League of United Latin American Citizens, said in a statement that he looked forward to \"building bridges\" with the Sheinbaum administration.\n\nIn past meetings, Garcia said he found Sheinbaum \"open, engaging, and willing to listen and share her thoughts on moving forward. Mexicans are vital to the United States' economic future and our hemisphere's overall robust vibrancy. At the same time, we must consider environmental and scientific initiatives in the interest of our well-being today and for future generations.\"\n\nWith an estimated 60% turnout for Sunday's vote, it was one of Mexico's biggest elections in history. Nearly 100 million people were eligible to vote.\n\nFor the first time, Mexican citizens living in the United States were able to cast their ballots in person at 20 consulates in the U.S., including in Phoenix.\n\nContributing: Rafael Carranza, Arizona Republic"

Some soccer fans suggested sarcastically that Trump was paying tribute to the popular Mexican football team, Club América .\n\nBut not everyone is laughing. In an editorial for the Mexican newspaper El Universal , legal expert Mario Melgar-Adalid advised the country to push back.\n\n\"Mexico must firmly oppose this interference, otherwise the next step could be that instead of the United Mexican States (Mexico's formal name), as established in our Constitution, they will begin to call us Old Mexico,\" he wrote.\n\nIn the Mexican coastal state of Veracruz, which borders the gulf, Governor Rocío Nahle rejected Trump's move. \"Today and always ... for 500 years it has been and will continue to be our rich and great 'Gulf of Mexico,'\" the governor wrote on social media last week.\n\nJuan Cobos, a former resident of Veracruz who now lives in Mexico City, called it \"absurd,\" saying hundreds of years of history could not be erased by a pen stroke.\n\n\"You can't change something overnight, what we've grown up with - history, geography, all that. You can't be so authoritarian that you can change it from one day to the next.\"\n\nAnother resident told CNN that \"many Veracruzanos express annoyance, others confusion, and for many it is amusing ... because people do not care that the name of the Gulf of Mexico will soon change, and they find it fun to play with the name change.\"\n\nAnother Mexico City resident called Trump's order \"so childish,\" telling CNN, \"Obviously it is not right.\"\n\nGoogle said on Monday its move was in line with its \"practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\" The company noted that the change would be applied only in the United States. Users in Mexico will continue to see the \"Gulf of Mexico\" on Google Maps. The rest of the world will see both names.\n\nTrump, in his executive order last week, said he directed that the body of water be renamed the Gulf of America \"in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our nation's economy and its people.\" The order calls for all federal government maps and documents to reflect the change.\n\nHe also ordered that the nation's highest mountain, Denali, change its name back to Mount McKinley, in honor of President William McKinley. Google said it would also update the name of its maps when the Geographic Names Information System, a government database of names and location data, is updated.\n\nSheinbaum responded with ridicule at the time. At a press conference, she presented a 1607 map that labeled parts of North America as \" Mexican America ,\" and dryly proposed that the gulf should be renamed as such.\n\nShe said: \"It sounds nice, no?\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

Most analysts agree that if general tariffs are imposed, Mexico could face a contraction of more than 1% of the Gross Domestic Product.\n\nA prolonged climate of uncertainty doesn't favor Mexico, according to Samuel Ortiz Velásquez, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\n\nAfter phone conversations with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada, Trump decided last Thursday to pause until April 2 the general tariffs for products that are under a trilateral trade agreement. In early February, Trump also suspended tariffs after Sheinbaum promised to send 10,000 national guards to the northern border to contain drug trafficking.\n\nDespite the agreements, Trump's decision on the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada, which are scheduled to come into effect on March 12, remains in limbo."

Demonstrators wearing white shirts waved signs, chanted \"We want peace!\" and burned effigies of local politicians.\n\nGarcia said Mexico's government should be negotiating with Trump on ways to collaborate and bring the violence to an end.\n\nIrama Garcia, also protesting, said she would welcome help from the U.S., Europe, or any international body that could stop the bloodshed.\n\n\"We need someone to support us and resolve the situation,\" she said.\n\nThe Mexican government has sent thousands of troops to Sinaloa in efforts to pacify the violence. High-profile arrests and large drug seizures have followed, but confronting the heavily armed cartels brings the risk of inflaming violence, as has happened in the past.\n\n\"To the people of Sinaloa: know that we are working on this every day,\" Sheinbaum said earlier this week.\n\n(Reporting by Jesus Bustamante, writing by Laura Gottesdiener; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)"

De la Fuente said on Wednesday from El Paso, Texas, that he's working on a legal defense strategy for Mexicans in the US, as well as on a process to simplify procedures and digitize the documents they may require in case of deportations. That includes documents such as birth and marriage certificates, he said in webcast remarks to Sheinbaum's daily press conference.\n\nAmong the reasons why Sheinbaum chose De la Fuente for this key role at the Foreign Ministry is that he measures his public statements and approaches the position in an institutional manner, said the people.\n\nA psychiatrist by training, De la Fuente was the chief of Sheinbaum's transition team and previously held roles such as Mexico's ambassador to the United Nations, rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and chair of the board of the Aspen Institute in Mexico.\n\nLast month, Trump threated to impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico as soon as he's inaugurated \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country.\"\n\nIn a call between the two leaders, held in English, Sheinbaum noted the efforts Mexico is making in both areas. Trump later described the call as a \"wonderful conversation.\"\n\nMexico will look to continue showing Trump the progress it's making to stop migrant caravans going north and reduce border crossings to the US -as well as the increase in fentanyl seizures - because Sheinbaum's administration believes Trump's threats could diminish if he sees progress in these areas, the people added.\n\n(Updates with Mexican strategy starting from the tenth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOffice Real Estate Is Facing 'a Year of Reckoning' in 2025\n\nPhil Knight Is Using His Nike Fortune to Make Oregon a Football Powerhouse\n\nThe Property Brothers Say Hold Off on the Big Home Renovation in 2025\n\nElon Musk's Christmas Gift to America: Chaos\n\nAI Giants Seek New Tactics Now That 'Low-Hanging Fruit' Is Gone\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

That's the difference. \"\n\nThat is why Lopez's jokes about Mexicans didn't elicit the same political backlash as the jokes about Puerto Rico and Latinos by Hinchcliffe, Pedraza said.\n\n\"George Lopez, he is delivering these jokes from a place that clearly he's signaled is out of love, respect and compassion for his community,\" Pedraza said.\n\nThe Trump campaign understands that Hinchcliffe's comments are likely to cost Trump votes and that is why the campaign has tried to distance themselves from the comments, Pedraza said.\n\n\"They know that it comes from a place where the aim is to exclude these people on the basis of a trait or a feature that is out of their control,\" Pedraza said. \"It's not equivalent.\"\n\nCésar Fierros, communications director at Living United for Change in Arizona, an advocacy group that works to increase voter participation by Latinos, said he does not believe Lopez's jokes will hurt the Harris campaign.\n\n\"If anything using Lopez as a surrogate is a great way to connect with Latino voters in AZ that adore his comedy, especially among older Latino voters,\" Fierros said in an email.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Fierros said, \"Hinchcliffe's comments explicitly targeted a community in a way that left an arena full of Trump supporters shocked, not amused. His words were unmistakably aimed at Puerto Ricans, and the audience's reaction was an audible gasp rather than laughter. I think that reflects how off-base and offensive it was.\"\n\nSome voter campaigns are already using Hinchcliffe's comments to try and erode Trump's support among Latino males , who prefer Trump at higher rates than Latinos in general.\n\nThe Working Families Party plans to send 100,000 text messages on Thursday aimed at Latino males, said Matthew Marquez, the group's Arizona campaign director.\n\n\"We're going to shine some light on what was said around Puerto Rico,\" Marquez said. \"If he attacks one Latino community, he is essentially attacking all our Latino communities.\"\n\nStill, some Latinos were put off by Lopez's jokes about Mexicans.\n\n\"It's never a good idea to reinforce stereotypes - no matter who delivers the punchline,\" said Phoenix City Councilman Carlos Galindo-Elvira, who has attended Harris campaign events. \"The consequences of the presidential election are far too serious for Latinos and all Americans.\"\n\nJoe Garcia, executive director of the Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund, a nonprofit political advocacy group, said the attention being placed on jokes by comedians is distracting from larger issues that will impact Latinos.\n\n\"It's a sad state of affairs when we are looking at what comedians have to say in determining who we should vote for as the leader of the free world,\" Garcia said. \"Rather than focusing on humor, or even inappropriate humor, we should focus instead on what is being said by the candidates themselves.\"\n\nFor instance, Garcia said, Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation in the nation's history.\n\n\"I don't think he's joking, I don't think he's kidding when he says that,\" Garcia said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nReporter Stephanie Murray contributed.\n\nReach the reporter at daniel.gonzalez@arizonarepublic.com .\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Is there a double standard over political rally jokes?"

Of those interviewed, 27.6% disapprove her administration, up from 22.5% in October.\n\nSheinbaum inherited top voter concerns of graft and security from her predecessor and mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Her first weeks in office were marred by bloody incidents including a murdered priest and car bombs. Still, this week her security team said homicides fell by 18.3% from 2018 to 2024 while high-impact crimes such as violent robberies also dropped.\n\nThe head of state faces scrutiny when it comes to fighting poverty, which is one of the top goals acquired from Lopez Obrador. Of those polled, 42% believe the policies in that area are bad, while only 35% think they are good.\n\nRoughly 29% of respondents have a negative opinion of Finance Minister Rogelio Ramirez de la O, while nearly 19% view him positively and almost 53% said that they were unsure when asked about the official.\n\nGrowing Optimism\n\nStill, the poll also showed support for Sheinbaum. The president's overall economic policies are considered good by 53%, while 27% think they're bad.\n\nMany voters also see the country heading in the right direction. About 57% of people interviewed believe Mexico's economic situation will improve during the next six months, while 26% think that it will get worse.\n\nOptimism increased since the start of Sheinbaum's term, when 51% of those surveyed believed the nation's economic outlook would get better.\n\nAlso, roughly 57% said Sheinbaum's economic policy management is better than that of her predecessor, while only some 23% believe it is worse.\n\nFor Palmira Tapia, a political scientist who works for the government of the State of Mexico, Sheinbaum's main challenge is combating organized crime.\n\n\"This could explain why the good opinion of her economic policy is not enough to offset the perception of insecurity and violence in some parts of the country,\" she said.\n\nAtlasIntel surveyed 1,749 people in Mexico between Dec. 26-31. The poll has a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHe Built Russia's Biggest Tech Company.

      "text": "ICE encounters fuel concern for Indigenous New Mexicans\n\nManage your account\n\nCorrection appended.\n\nSome tribal leaders in the Southwest are urging members of Indigenous communities to carry personal identification amid anxiety about President Donald Trump's promises to expand deportations.\n\nTheir concern is that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will mistake Native Americans for illegal immigrants.\n\nMescalero Apache Tribe President Thora Walsh-Padilla said in a written statement Thursday she's received multiple calls since Wednesday evening from tribal members who've heard of such encounters.\n\nThe Southern New Mexico tribe was able to verify only one incident in which an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent questioned a tribal member in a public place in Ruidoso on Wednesday, approaching the person and asking for a passport in Spanish, Walsh-Padilla said in the statement.\n\n\"To be safe, be aware of your surroundings, let family members/friends know where you are, and keep identification with you at all times. If possible, then carry multiple forms of identification,\" Walsh-Padilla wrote.\n\nThe statement added the ICE agent stopped questioning the tribal member once the individual presented a New Mexico driver's license and a tribal identification card.\n\nSome Navajo officials have raised similar concerns.\n\n\"Despite possessing Certificates of Indian Blood and state-issued IDs, several individuals have been detained or questioned by ICE agents who do not recognize these documents as valid proof of citizenship,\" the Navajo Nation Council said in a statement Thursday.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to emailed questions Friday.\n\n\"ICE agents are harassing and threatening Native Americans,\" wrote U.S Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, D-New Mexico, in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Trump said you can tell bad immigrants by what they 'look' like. Tribal members look like the first Americans. Stop harassing them.\"\n\nNavajo Nation President Buu Nygren has urged caution, noting in a social media post there has been some panic in Native communities since Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president on Monday.\n\n\"My office has received multiple reports from Navajo citizens that they have had negative, and sometimes traumatizing, experiences with federal agents targeting undocumented immigrants in the Southwest,\" the statement said.\n\nIn Thursday's statement, the Navajo Nation Council pressed Nygren to take urgent action to address concerns about ICE raids in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, as reported by Navajo citizens and state officials, which \"have sparked significant fear, especially among tribal members in urban areas who face challenges with documentation.\"\n\nThe council stressed the need for collaboration with state and federal governments as well as other tribal nations to \"address the broader implications of these raids.\" Plans include a toll-free hotline, community outreach to educate citizens on their rights and legal support for those affected by ICE actions.\n\n\"It's very new. I was blown away,\" New Mexico Sen. Shannon Pinto, D-Tohatchi, said about the speed with which the Trump administration has acted on campaign promises.\n\nThe state senator, who is Navajo, spoke about wanting to converse with other lawmakers in the early days of the 2025 New Mexico legislative session and potentially put out a statement on the matter.\n\nPinto said she has not directly heard from constituents with concerns about ICE but said \"I think there has been some concerned voices, and that's why the president [of the Navajo Nation] put out his statement.\"\n\nThe New Mexican received several reports of operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at restaurants and schools, as well as checkpoints on roadways, and messages circulated on social media. However, no such incidents or arrests could be confirmed by law enforcement agencies, government officials, advocacy organizations or businesses.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on Friday, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., predicted Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants via executive order will fail. He said Trump lacks the authority to \"rewrite the Constitution\" or \"eliminate an amendment with the stroke of a pen.\" A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the executive order, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"I'm terribly worried about the type of profiling we're going to see in this country,\" said Vasquez, who is a first-generation Mexican American and whose border district is one of the most Hispanic congressional districts in the country.\n\n\"It's so critically important that the American public understands the contributions of immigrants to this country,\" Vasquez said. \"So again, if we start to see mass deportations of folks like farmworkers who help us secure our nation's food security, who help lower the cost of goods all the way from production to the grocery store, when we start to seeing that Dreamers don't get a fair shot at becoming American citizens, when families are torn apart, I think the American public is going to realize this is the wrongheaded approach.\"\n\nSanta Fe has a City Council resolution in place declaring itself a \"welcoming community for immigrants and refugees\" and limiting local authorities' cooperation with immigration enforcement.\n\nThis story has been amended to reflect the following correction. A previous version of this article referred to Mescalero Apache Tribe President Thora Walsh-Padilla as \"he,\" rather than \"she.\" The error was made in editing."

      "text": "A day without Mexicans in Mammoth? Locals mull how to get a message to Trump\n\nManage your account\n\nIf all the service workers born in Mexico stayed home from their jobs for just one day in this thriving resort town perched high in California's Sierra Nevada, the humming tourist economy would probably faceplant harder than a first-time skier on an icy expert slope.\n\nMost of the restaurants would have no staff, residents say. Hotels and Airbnbs would suffer the same fate. Construction projects across this posh skiing destination would come to a grinding halt.\n\n\"I think that would be like one of those zombie movies,\" said Jose Diaz, 33, from Sinaloa, a supervisor at the Stove, a cozy breakfast spot in the heart of town.\n\nLike so many others who have made their way here from small towns in Mexico, Diaz didn't come for the skiing. He had heard through the grapevine that Mammoth was a good place to earn a steady paycheck.\n\nThat was 14 years ago. Now, Diaz and his wife - she's from Guadalajara, and they met working at a Mammoth restaurant - are both here legally, he said. They have two kids born in the U.S. and recently bought a condo in town.\n\nBut, like almost everyone else in this alpine community of about 7,000 people, they have friends and family who would be vulnerable if President-elect Donald Trump's pronouncements about deporting millions of undocumented immigrants actually come to pass.\n\nLocals are torn about how exactly to respond. Some workers say they are counting on Trump, given his business background, to take a softer stance when it comes to resort towns such as Mammoth and South Lake Tahoe, whose economies would be devastated by mass deportations.\n\nOthers urge something more proactive: Restaurant kitchens, hotel break rooms and group chats have been buzzing with the notion of Latino workers staging a one-day strike to demonstrate the town's dependence on imported labor.\n\nMayor Chris Bubser said she sympathizes with the growing anxiety around deportations, but hopes the strike doesn't materialize.\n\n\"I feel badly for the business owners, because they're not the ones making these awful threats and they'd be left in the lurch,\" Bubser said.\n\nAs state and local officials across California grapple with the potential consequences of Trump's proposed deportations, the natural focus is on farm communities in the Central Valley, where roughly half the people working in the fields and orchards are believed to be undocumented.\n\nBut pricier ZIP Codes are vulnerable, too, and it's hard to imagine anywhere in the state that would suffer more than Mammoth Lakes if a substantial percentage of its undocumented workforce suddenly disappeared.\n\nThat's because almost all of the tourists who flock to this internationally renowned resort are white-collar professionals. And the people who own property are, by and large, real estate investors, skiers with enough money to afford a second home or well-to-do retirees who headed for the hills to escape the congestion of coastal cities. None of them are likely to respond to help-wanted ads for line cooks and snowplow drivers.\n\nSo, immigrants end up doing most of the labor.\n\nAbout a third of Mammoth's population is Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and more than half the students in the local public school system are from Spanish-speaking homes.\n\nMany of the Latinos in town are citizens or green card holders, some from families who have lived here for generations. But residents guess at least half are in the country illegally. They're not hard to find.\n\nOn a recent chilly afternoon, about a half dozen men were clearing snow from a commercial office building in town. The roofing company owner asked to be identified only as Julio, because he is undocumented. He said he has been doing construction work in the U.S. since 1989, most of that time in Mammoth Lakes.\n\nHis company has 15 employees, he said. He also has three kids, all U.S. citizens; his oldest is an officer for the California Highway Patrol.\n\nHe has doubts about the benefits of a one-day strike by Latino workers: \"The purpose of doing it is to show that Hispanic labor is necessary, but I'm pretty sure everyone already knows that,\" he said with a shrug.\n\nHe mentioned the record snowfall in the winter of 2022-23, when homeowners were desperate to get snow off their roofs before their houses collapsed.\n\n\"I didn't see a whole lot of Americans, you know, white guys, up on those roofs,\" Julio said.\n\nHe's not worrying much about the talk of deportations, he said, in part because he sees no point in stressing about something he can't control. But he also said he thinks Trump is a rational businessman who must know how much undocumented laborers add to the economy.\n\nAnd Trump is in construction, Julio joked, so, \"I'm pretty sure he's got some undocumented people working for him, too.\"\n\nIn fact, while Julio was put off by the sweeping, derogatory comments Trump made about Mexicans during the campaign, he thinks Trump is \"a pretty good president.\" He's right about deporting people who come across the border illegally \"looking for free stuff,\" Julio said.\n\n\"I've been working my ass off,\" Julio said. \"I pay all my medical bills out of my pocket, my dentist, my vision. I didn't get any low-income housing, because I don't think I need it.\"\n\nHe hopes Trump will spare hard workers, like him, who \"make the country stronger,\" he said. But he's fine with deporting lazy people.\n\n\"Whoever doesn't benefit the country, kick them out of here,\" he said.\n\nFor others, the shocking breadth of Trump's threat to deport up to 11 million undocumented U.S. residents is terrifying. It's hard for them to imagine how a dragnet of that size could pause to consider the merits of individual cases.\n\nA secretary in the Mammoth school system, who asked only to be identified as Maria, is one of the people who is worried.\n\nShe said she came from Mexico with her mother when she was a kid and has since been granted U.S. citizenship. But her husband, who has worked in construction in Mammoth for more than 20 years, is undocumented.\n\nHe got caught coming across the border illegally when he was 14, and has not been able to \"adjust his status,\" she said.\n\nMaria and her husband have three kids, all born in the U.S. One is about to join the military, she said. But the kids follow the news and hear the gossip at school, and their anxiety is building.\n\n\"My 10-year-old is terrified with the new president saying he's going to deport everyone,\" Maria said.\n\nIn addition to working in construction, her husband has worked as a bus driver for the school district and recently started his own snow removal business. He has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITN, a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service to foreign nationals - including undocumented immigrants - so that they can pay taxes like everybody else.\n\n\"He is a responsible guy, a hard-working guy, with no ugly background at all,\" Maria said.\n\nA few years ago, his kidneys failed. He was able to get dialysis and, eventually, a transplant, thanks to the health insurance Maria gets through her job at the school district. But he now depends on very specific medication to stay alive, Maria said.\n\nIf he gets deported and has to return to the village they're from in Michoacan, Maria worries that he'll lose access to the lifesaving pills.\n\n\"People in Mexico die from things like that,\" she said.\n\nLike many law enforcement officers in California, Mono County Sheriff Ingrid Braun said she won't help round up undocumented residents for deportation. But she worries that fear of federal immigration agents will prevent people from reaching out to her for help when they've been robbed, assaulted by a romantic partner or otherwise victimized.\n\n\"They're not going to call if they're afraid he's going to get deported, or that they'll be separated from their kids,\" Braun said.\n\nFor the moment, Braun said, she's skeptical the roundups will actually materialize. \"I don't think they have a plan. I think it was all a bunch of talk,\" she said.\n\nThough she can't do anything to stop federal agents if they show up, she said, news travels fast in a small town and she thinks outsiders who don't know the lay of the land would struggle to catch locals who would almost certainly know they were coming.\n\nShe also thinks the disruption to the economy would be so severe that immigration officials would get little cooperation from others in town. One way or another, most everyone here depends on the immigrants.\n\n\"People think resort towns like Mammoth are just full of rich people playing,\" Braun said. But it's immigrants who do all the work and keep the \"industry humming.\"\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

By the sound of the statistics, Mexicans' satisfaction with their lot ought to be low.\n\nBut despite weak performance across rankings in the 2013 \"Better Life\" index released this week by the 34-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Mexicans come out strong in terms of satisfaction. They're more satisfied with their lives than the average in the OECD - a collection of mostly wealthy nations - and fall just behind a handful of countries like Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark: 85 percent of Mexicans say they have more positive experiences than negative ones in a given day.\n\nIt's not because they're making more money. Mexicans earn roughly half the OECD annual average wage of about $23,000 in a country plagued by inequality. The top 20 percent of earners bring home nearly 13 times what the bottom 20 percent earn here.\n\nAnd it's not because they have more free time. The OECD report calculates that Mexicans work 2,250 hours per year - the highest rate of all the countries surveyed. Women, more of whom work in the informal sector, still bear the brunt of labor at home, too. Mexican men dedicate less than a third of their time on unpaid domestic work than women do.\n\nSchool isn't a bright spot, either. When it comes to education, Mexico falls well below OECD nations in reading literacy, math, and science test scores. Few people earn a high school diploma compared to the rest of the OECD field: 36 percent versus the organization average of 74 percent.\n\nMexicans even fare worse in life expectancy: 74 years versus 80 years, the OECD average.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nFaith, family, and pride in the patria, or homeland, may have something to do with it.\n\n\"Even if the economy isn't great, the opportunity God gives us to live every day is more than sufficient,\" says Marina Garcia while playing in a park with her two dogs.\n\nRosalina Tuma, waiting for a Tai Chi class to begin, says, \"I live happily.

Apart from government pronouncements and \"folkloric\" tourism campaigns, she said, it's as if \"dark-skinned people don't exist.\"\n\nIt might seem like a harsh judgment. After all, Mexican tourism campaigns promote the nation's multicultural heritage and its heritage as a home of the Aztec and Mayan empires. The nation of 118 million people includes 15.7 million who consider themselves indigenous. Moreover, an estimated 450,000 Afro-Mexicans live mostly along the coasts.\n\nLegislators amended Mexico's constitution in 2001 to bar all forms of discrimination and set up the National Council to Prevent Discrimination. Twenty-two of Mexico's 32 states (including the federal district) now have anti-discrimination laws on the books. The nation has signed more than two dozen international treaties and conventions banning unfair treatment.\n\nBut the distance between legalities and practice is substantial, said Mario Arriagada Cuadriello, a doctoral candidate in comparative politics at the London School of Economics. He is an editor at Nexos, a leading cultural and political magazine.\n\nWhen Mr. Arriagada published an article in this month's issue about widespread discrimination in Mexico, he received a flurry of responses.\n\n\"People wrote to say that if you are light-skinned, you get better treatment in restaurants,\" he said. One person told him that in an exclusive area of the capital, residents ask that their dark-skinned domestic servants not walk in the common gardens \"because it is anti-aesthetic and makes the areas ugly.\"\n\nOne of Mexico's most prominent intellectuals from the early 20th century, Jose Vasconcelos, held up the mestizo, or person of mixed Indian and European blood, as part of a superior \"cosmic race\" with greater spiritual values.\n\nFollowing the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910, the government embraced the mestizo as an ideal. Images of dark-skinned Mexicans appeared on items such as lottery tickets. By midcentury, in an apparent effort to win over the upper class, the then-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party adopted images of more European-looking Mexicans wearing Indian clothing. People of all color filled the Congress, and still do.\n\nAt the end of the century, Mexico had accepted global norms against discrimination. But kiosks sagged with society magazines, such as Caras, Central, and Clase, published by some of the nation's biggest tycoons and celebrating the light-skinned moneyed classes, a distinct minority.\n\nIndigenous Mexicans rarely appear in media and are treated as a class apart, although the discrimination is closely tied to economic conditions.\n\n\"The Indian is only accepted if he is decorative, wearing his traditional costume. But not in jeans and a jacket because then [the perception is that] he'll rob you,\" de Anda said.\n\nOn playgrounds and sidewalks, a fighting insult is to describe someone in racial terms as a dark indigenous person.\n\nAccording to a 2010 government survey on discrimination, only 13 percent of Mexicans considered themselves light-skinned or blonde while 64.6 percent said they were \"dark.\" The rest described themselves as anywhere from \"cinnamon,\" \"swarthy,\" \"chocolate,\" \"brown,\" \"yellow,\" \"a little tanned\" to \"black.\"\n\nArriagada flipped through a copy of Clase, a magazine-style supplement to the El Universal newspaper that gives photo spreads to prominent families during their beach holidays, at weddings, or celebrating social events.\n\n\"Look,\" he said of those portrayed in its pages, \"it's like Norway.\"\n\nFor his Nexos article, Arriagada counted the photos of light- and dark-skinned people appearing in publications. In a May edition of Club, a social supplement to the Reforma newspaper, he tallied 529 light-skinned people and 11 with darker skin. In a March issue of Caras, published by the Televisa conglomerate, he found 340 light-skinned people and four who were darker.\n\nEven foreign media conglomerates adhere to the pattern, he said. He pointed to Quien, a women's jet set and celebrity magazine published by Grupo Expansion, a subsidiary of Time Inc., part of Time Warner Inc.\n\n\"It's a white people's magazine,\" Arriagada said, \"in a nation that is not white.\"\n\nOn the company's website, Quien is pitched as a magazine aimed at the Mexican woman who is \"a trendsetter and opinion leader among her social circle.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Grupo Expansion, Maria Fernanda Evia Portillo, said in an email that the magazine has made efforts for \"the inclusion of different groups: gay community, activists, politicians, and successful and influential people in Mexico.\"\n\nIn addition to articles about a Mormon activist, a Roman Catholic priest to migrants, and a poet who lost a son to hired gunmen, Evia sent a copy of a 2011 article on textiles made by the Otomi ethnicity and another on an indigenous woman who has entered politics in the state of Oaxaca.\n\nAdvocates for greater equality say videos of abusive behavior posted on the Internet have helped spark an outcry.\n\nA video went viral last month that showed municipal inspectors in Villahermosa forcing an indigenous boy to dump candies he was selling from a basket onto the ground, and then taking three packs of cigarettes from him. The Tabasco state governor pledged to give the Tzotzil boy a scholarship, and first lady Angelica Rivera also pledged assistance.\n\nThis week, a 31-second video of two city inspectors in Cancun harassing an indigenous woman selling trinkets in the resort's hotel zone led to their suspension.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It translates directly to \"rotten fruit\" and implies both poor Spanish skills and a perceived superiority complex.\n\nBut in a small conference room at the \" pocha house,\" a nongovernmental organization is accelerating the work it has done over the past decade to help deportees - and reframe the term pocho into something that means pride, resistance, and resilience. The work of Otros Dreams en Acción (ODA) couldn't come soon enough. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to expel mass numbers of unauthorized immigrants his first day in office.\n\nDeportations entail fear and heartbreak. But amid an expected wave of deportees from the U.S., Mexican civil society is mobilizing to lay out a more positive reintegration.\n\nODA joins other civil society groups across Mexico preparing a massive reintegration effort, by publishing information on how to access schools and jobs, or by working to shape attitudes towards deportees and toward the act of rebuilding lives more broadly. Experts say those efforts are critical at this time of transition since the Mexican government's response to the uptick in deportations over the past 15 years has been reactionary - and this wave could set records.\n\n\"Truly those who take charge of the reintegration of deportees are civil society organizations and family networks, for those who have them,\" says Nuty Cárdenas Alaminos, an associate professor at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics whose research focuses on deportation and the reintegration of returnees.\n\nAn estimated 12 million unauthorized immigrants reside in the U.S., and that's likely an undercount. If Mr. Trump follows through on his promises, the vast majority of those deported are expected to be Mexican, the nationality of almost 40% of unauthorized immigrants in 2022.\n\nMexico has experience with mass deportations, as recently as the administration of Barack Obama, whom some referred to as \"the deporter in chief\" for the estimated 5 million people deported between 2009 and 2017. Mr. Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden also racked up significant deportation numbers at roughly 1.5 million deportees in each four-year term (through fiscal year 2024), according to the Migration Policy Institute. Mr. Biden's tally is closer to 4.4 million if including Title 42 expulsions during the pandemic.\n\nOne lesson learned for researchers - and the Mexican government - over the past 15 years has been that preparing for deportations needs to begin long before people start arriving back.\n\nThe more than 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. have reinforced programs over the past several years offering legal assistance to their citizens. And in recent weeks they've created links between schools and legal firms, and contracted more than 2,500 legal professionals to support consular services for Mexicans in the U.S. without authorization or in legal limbo.\n\nBut inside Mexico, state and federal governments have provided little training or policy proposals. That's why ODA has called a meeting on a chilly evening in late December, with butcher paper and markers to brainstorm ideas in English and Spanish. The attendees include those previously deported or forced to return to Mexico, academics and professionals, and a slew of volunteers. They discuss publishing information packets outlining basic first steps for reintegration into Mexico or creating a registry of returnees willing to help new arrivals with schools and jobs in cities across Mexico.\n\nThe group, formed 10 years ago, last year successfully advocated for lifting the Mexican government requirement for school transcripts to be officially stamped before giving children from abroad the right to enter Mexican public schools - a barrier that had vexed returning families, says Leni Álvarez, the ODA co-director.\n\nShe was brought to the U.S. at age 2 and grew up saying the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance every morning at school. When her family had to return to Mexico amid pressure on unauthorized immigrants and the financial crisis, she recalls a bureaucratic nightmare trying to get admitted to the Mexican school system, and a general sense of not belonging in the country of her birth.\n\nSo tonight her focus is on action. \"How can we attend to this population this time around?\" she asks the group gathered. \"And in a sustainable way, so that we don't burn out?\"\n\nThis question echoes across Mexican society. Deportation has turned one couple in Mexico into social media influencers poised to help those now at risk of being kicked out of the U.S.\n\nIn May 2020, Candice and Fidel, who only use their first names for privacy, started sharing on social media details of their family's experience rebuilding their lives in Mexico following Fidel's 2016 deportation from the U.S. Candice, an American, fields many logistical questions - about 50 to 100 daily. But she also shares across her platforms under the name _laguerita70 stories of the family building its \"forever\" home in the central state of Puebla where Fidel left for the U.S. when he was 17. She runs errands with their three children (two of whom were born in Mexico) and learns to bake traditional Mexican treats.\n\n\"My goal is just to be there\" for families experiencing deportation and putting down new roots, she says.\n\nThat psychological support - for returnees and Mexican society - can be just as important as the logistical. ODA has experimented with free mental health services for deportees who often face depression from the displacement. Humanitarian groups are also holding events to educate local communities that deportees need a helping hand - not stigmatization as criminals.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nThe pochos at this ODA strategy meeting are prepared to help in the work of shifting attitudes because they have the lived experience, they say. \"The biggest tool of this new [Trump] administration is to terrorize and create uncertainty,\" says one young returnee in a room with a sign on the door that reads \"Resistance.\" \"We have to stand up to these challenges with creativity.\"\n\nHer fiery words are met by a sea of nodding heads. This is a group of individuals who say they are ready to stand up to the challenges coming their way like true pochos leaning into pride, resistance, and resilience - and a deep understanding of what it's like to live both here, and there.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Belgians, at the opposite end of the spectrum, work 7 hours daily. The OECD average is 8 hours, with Americans working about 8-1/2 hours daily.\n\nThe unpaid work includes housework or other chores. Mexicans do the most work in the home, at 3 hours a day, while Koreans do the least, at 1 hour and 19 minutes. Much of that is dedicated to cooking. Americans spend the least amount of time in the kitchen - only 30 minutes daily. The conclusions were drawn by asking those surveyed, including those retired or on vacation, to report what they were doing every five minutes.\n\nRELATED: Top 5 nations working the most hours\n\nFrom company advertisements to Hollywood films to TV cartoons, Mexican culture with its afternoon siesta has been stereotyped as lackadaisical and half-baked. But whether they are computer engineers, government hacks, or street vendors, most Mexicans log longer days than American doctors and Wall Street bigwigs.\n\nDon't buy it? Then I can offer an arsenal of anecdotal evidence, starting with myself. Years ago when I was living in Boston , a phone call after 11 p.m. was likely a friend just back from a first date. Now, as a reporter based in Mexico City , when my phone rings at that hour I assume it is Los Pinos, the White House of Mexico.\n\nI am often invited to press conferences arranged at 10 p.m. the night before. When I seek out interviews with sources, it is not uncommon that they can only talk after 8 p.m. Happy hour at 5 p.m.? Try 10 p.m.\n\nBut for most Mexicans, such long work days are not offset with additional vacation time. Many Mexicans work in the informal economy, meaning that they have no state protection and their endless hours are the only way to make ends meet.\n\nRELATED: Top 5 nations working the most hours\n\nEven in the corporate world, vacation is more an ideal than a reality. With a good job at a Mexican company, my husband only receives seven days of vacation a year, and that is only after the first year. Yes, seven, and his work hours are 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nLabor abuse is rampant. The two doormen in our building work 24-hour shifts every other day. Once I asked one why he did not demand better conditions. \"Someone else will just take the job,\" he said plainly.\n\nI am not sure where the lazy stereotype has its origins. A day's work in Mexico is far more than an average day elsewhere, as anyone who has sat in late-night traffic jams, or witnessed a street vendor working 12-plus hours every day on the same street corner.\n\nThis is not to say Mexican work culture is particularly efficient. Part of the reason my husband works 11 hours is that he is essentially forced to take a two-hour lunch every day. Lunch at the desk is pretty much unheard of. I can recall at least a dozen times that I have waited hours for a plumber or roofer who simply did not show up.\n\nSo are Mexicans productive? Not necessarily. Punctual? Less so. But lazy? Para nada.\n\nHow well do you know Mexico? Take our quiz.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Login\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

Mexico is now a potential model for the rest of Central America.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 09, 2021, 2:12 p.m. ET\n\nOn her first trip to Central America to promote good governance, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris found a pleasant surprise in one stop. Despite a wave of campaign violence, Mexican voters turned out strong on June 6 for the country's largest, and perhaps cleanest, elections.\n\nThey also sent a message to a populist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, that he should not jeopardize the independence of the election watchdog and the courts. His Morena party lost dozens of seats in Congress, dashing hopes of a supramajority that would allow him to alter the constitution.\n\nFor a democracy that ended one-party rule only a quarter-century ago, Mexico now emerges as a potential model for a region backsliding in electoral integrity and toward strong-man rule. A whole range of civic-minded people, from a million poll workers to public intellectuals, stood up for the endurance of Mexico's democratic institutions. They affirmed the need for a check on the executive branch and a higher level of debate and consensus.\n\nThe educated middle class in Mexico City, where the president was once a popular mayor, was especially important in giving AMLO, as the president is called, an electoral shellacking. While his party retains a majority in Congress and took most of the governorships on the ballot, he appeared humbled after the election. His ambitions to rule without the restraints of normal democracy were given a course correction by voters eager to safeguard basic institutions.\n\nThe results are notable for a country that has the ninth highest homicide rate in the world and whose economy has not grown in two years. Mexico's recent history of both left and right governments has led many voters to worry first about their democracy's ability to find centrist solutions. Their display of self-governance should make the Biden administration's goal of seeing and supporting real democracy in Central America a bit easier.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But the high-protein, low-impact cuisine could have lessons for the rest of the world, as well.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated May 01, 2017, 9:01 a.m. ET | Mexico City\n\nAt first glance, the stalls set up in this neighborhood garden look like they could be part of any typical farmer's market. There are the men selling artisanal chocolates, the bread maker stacking her loaves precariously high, and the couple slinging tortillas over a smoking comal, or griddle.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, there's something buggy about this scene. Literally.\n\nA glistening cockroach is perched upon that square of chocolate. There are crispy brown grasshoppers cooked into that bread. And the tortillas? Smeared with fly eggs and garnished with a spicy green salsa.\n\nThis is the third annual Festival of Edible Insects, and the crowded passageways between the horseshoe of stalls is a testament to the growing resurgence in popularity of this centuries-old Mexican culinary tradition, amid a broader uptick of interest in Mexico's heritage that goes beyond its borders.\n\nEating bugs \"is confused with being something exotic,\" not just by foreigners, but by many city-dwelling Mexicans as well, says Isaac Sandoval, co-owner of the Época de Oro Chocolateria, who is serving up critter-covered chocolates.\n\n\"This is tradition and is a huge part of Mexico's story,\" Mr. Sandoval says.\n\nThe Mesoamerican diet has long included hundreds of species of insects. Although many rural and small towns across the country have held on to the tradition, it fell out of favor in bigger cities where bugs are more often associated with rolled-up newspapers than nutrition.\n\nBut it's having a renaissance, both in Mexico and internationally. Some vendors here today export their products, like Chilipines Gourmetier, which sells legless grasshoppers (less crunch getting stuck in one's teeth) destined for Switzerland, Spain, and Canada. And top Mexican chefs have helped amp up the \"cool factor\" of edible insects in recent years with the inclusion of things like soft, cream-colored ant eggs in omelets at popular brunch spots, or crunchy grasshoppers mixed into guacamole at restaurants with white table cloths.\n\nInsects on the menu are part of a broader, global interest in Mexican culinary and artistic traditions, says fair organizer Enrique Cervantes, who is sporting a green foam hat shaped like a grasshopper. \"Frida [Kahlo], mezcal, pulque, mole, anything from Oaxaca, really,\" says Mr. Cervantes. \"There's more of an interest in Mexican food and culture world-wide.\"\n\nTop Mexican chefs who feature traditional ingredients and recipes have opened restaurants in places from New York City to Dubai, and Mexico City was featured as the top place to visit in 2016 by The New York Times. Two-thirds of Americans have favorable views of their southern neighbor , according to a February Gallup poll. That's the highest percentage in a decade, despite the prevalence of headlines about drug trafficking and violence in US coverage of Mexico.\n\nAnd ever since US President Trump cannon-balled into the US political scene, there's been greater interest in Mexico from within Mexico, too, Cervantes says. After months of jabs from north of the border about Mexicans as criminals, or dragging the US down, \"Mexico and its traditions are finally being valued by Mexicans,\" he says. For decades before, he feels, people were \"down on Mexico,\" prioritizing US or European culture. \"But little by little, we're starting to love ourselves.\"\n\n\"We are starting to find our own force, what we can offer the world,\" he adds, leaning back in a plastic chair and watching as festival-goers flow in from the street. \"We have this incredibly rich gastronomy and ingredients that are historic and so unique...that's something we can take pride in.\"\n\nBug-eating, in particular, is \"like eating history,\" he says.\n\nNineteen-year-old Bruno Ituarte came to the festival because he was interested in expanding his bug-eating repertoire. \"I'm from Mexico City, so I didn't grow up eating these things,\" he says, taking an audibly crunchy bite of his cockroach con chocolate . \"I've had chapulines (grasshoppers) and tried gusano de maguey (agave worms) once or twice,\" he says. \"People in the city can be hesitant, but you see a bug in the street and that's one thing. These bugs are harvested and farmed. And really, they take on the flavor of what they're cooked in.\"\n\nA few stalls away, Jesus Ortiz and Uveira Cruz Soriano, who started a collective in Oaxaca dedicated to gathering and promoting insects eaten in pre-Hispanic times, disagree. Mr. Ortiz and his wife are preparing traditional Oaxacan tlayudas (flatbreads) and topping them off with insects big and small. The end results are colorful masterpieces in hues of reds, oranges, and greens. He rattles off the names of the dozens of creepy-crawly delicacies laid out at his stand: chapulines, chicatanas , cuchamas , cocopaches, and condaches are just a few.\n\n\"Each bug has its own distinct flavor,\" he says. He's here today because of the importance he sees in teaching Mexicans about their own history and culture. \"Food is part of our genetic map. If we don't teach our kids to gather grasshoppers with nets from crops or what season the chicatanas come out, we'll lose this history,\" Ortiz says. \"My grandkids eat grasshoppers with beans and think it's delicious.\"\n\nHe also sees a bright future in including bugs in all diets, citing a 2013 report published by the United Nations saying insects are a valuable source of protein, and could be an environmentally friendly key to fighting global hunger . Feeding the world in 2050, the report notes, will likely require twice the food produced today - and insects, whose cultivation requires less land and produces fewer greenhouse gases compared to traditional meats, could be one way to fill that gap.\n\nBug-eating in the future, however, depends on sustainable choices in the present. Despite the excitement around entomophagy here today, some vendors say it's not just about teaching history and the joy of cooking with insects that's important. Maintaining an environment where these insects can continue to hatch is paramount.\n\nGuillermo Barragan, who also goes by the name \"Don Aceituno,\" or Sir Olive, gives out olive samples in front of his wife's stall where she's hawking snacks made of ground-up fly eggs. His family is from Mexico State, and for generations has gathered fly larvae called Axayacatl around his town's brackish lakes. The eggs, sometimes referred to as Mexican caviar and named after an Aztec emperor, have become increasing difficult to harvest, Mr. Barragan says.\n\n\"Climate change and urbanization have wiped out\" much of the marshy environment where these eggs are traditionally laid, he says. Now he and his neighbors plunge pine fronds into the water's edge, creating a substitute habitat for the Axayacatl to lay their eggs.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Tens of thousands of Mexicans jam the Zócalo, the sprawling public square in front of Mexico's National Palace. They don oversized sombreros and mustaches in a raucous nod to the revolutionaries who founded Mexico, starting with the call from priest Miguel Hidalgo in Dolores to rise up against colonial Spain on the morning of Sept. 16, 1810.\n\n\"Viva México! Viva México! Viva México!\" thunders the country's leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as AMLO, from a dais at the National Palace.\n\n\"Viva!\" returns the crowd in a sonorous, synchronized chant.\n\nWhat does it mean to be Mexican? Five hundred years after the Spanish conquest, three years after Donald Trump took office, and one year after Mexico elected its most populist president in decades, the answer is complex - but also proud.\n\nThe heroes of Mexican independence celebrations - which kick off with El Grito, or the cry of Dolores, each Sept. 15 - are always clear. But they are never as absolute as the rituals might suggest - and that's never been truer than this year, 500 years after Hernán Cortés arrived at the coast of Veracruz and waged the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire.\n\n\"Viva México,\" the cry of independence that marks Mexico's struggle against imperial Spain, has always implied a search for identity in a country that defines itself as mestizo , or mixed blood, but hasn't always been at ease with that reality.\n\nOctavio Paz, the late Mexican poet and Nobel Prize winner, wrote in \"The Labyrinth of Solitude,\" an essay on Mexican identity, that the cry, when used in the context of an expletive, carries with it the subtext of a ravaged nation that is both a challenge and an affirmation. \"When we shout this cry on the 15th of September, the anniversary of our independence, we affirm ourselves in front, against, and in spite of the 'others.'\"\n\nToday the country's struggle is no longer in opposition to European conquerors. The new foes are globalization, neoliberalism, and the United States under President Donald Trump - who many Mexicans believe has humiliated their country, sparking a renewed sense of patriotism and nationalism. It comes as Mexico, not coincidentally, has elected its most nationalist, populist leader in decades.\n\nIndeed, for many in the square here, the \"Viva México\" exhortations are a battle cry for a new Mexican nation, or the Fourth Transformation, that AMLO has promised will mark his presidency. The 4T, as it's called, would follow independence in 1821, the reform movement of the 1850s, and finally the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920.\n\nAlejandro Moreno, who conducts public opinion polls, says enthusiasm for AMLO's government comes with a surge in what it means to be Mexican. In polling around Independence Day for the newspaper El Financiero, national pride stood at an average of 91% for all 32 Mexican states.\n\nOn the edge of the main square here, Edgar Tena, an accountant and lawyer, is dressed in a velvet hat with red, white, and green stripes, the colors of the Mexican flag. His wife and college-age sons are wearing equally over-the-top headgear. This he calls their patriotism - and it's the first time they've opted to display it at an independence celebration since his sons were born. But he says his nationalism runs much deeper, and he strikes a more somber note.\n\n\"We cannot accept it, so many things have built up, and this is why we shout,\" he says. \"We want to be free. This is a call of hope, and the hope that the 4T represents. Viva México!\"\n\nA gulf has always existed between Mexico and American perceptions of the country: At worst, people north of the border view Mexico as a backward or crime-ridden nation that pushes unauthorized immigrants to the U.S., at best a place for a beach vacation. In fact, with thousands of years of indigenous history woven into the fabric of modern life, Mexico is \"the most authentically mestizo of all the Latin American countries and has achieved a greater degree of cultural synthesis,\" says Ronald Wright, author of \"Stolen Continents,\" a book about the survival of indigenous cultures after the conquest.\n\nBut the country's rich and diverse history is hard to appreciate in the U.S., experts here say, when the rhetoric coming from the north is often so harsh. In the 2016 election, Mr. Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" and \"criminals.\" He made a border wall the centerpiece of his campaign and promised it would be the Mexicans who would pay for it. His administration has pushed Mexico to do more to stop Central American migrants - causing some anti-migrant sentiment to flare in Mexico, which in turn has offended people's pride in the country as a haven for war refugees and political exiles.\n\nFor many Mexicans, the deadly attack Aug. 3 at a Walmart in El Paso by a gunman railing against the \"Hispanic invasion\" of Texas represents the apotheosis of anti-Mexican sentiment in the U.S. Its roots trace as far back as Protestant colonizers in a fledgling America whose antipathy toward Catholic Spaniards remains to this day in the form of anti-Hispanic sentiment, says Mexican historian Silvestre Villegas Revueltas from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City.\n\nBut animosity toward the U.S. also runs deep in Mexico. Anti-Americanism predates the Mexican-American War, in which Mexico lost half its territory to the U.S. in 1848 while the U.S. became a regional and later a global superpower. From the second half of the 19th century on, Mexican foreign policy was shaped around the idea of differentiating itself, as much as economically and politically possible, from imperial Yanquis.\n\nThe antipathy was finally tempered during negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the 1990s. The accord's promise of a partnership drew the two nations together and old misgivings were buried, at least for a time. It would be wrong to say that widespread anti-Americanism has flared anew in Mexico; the deep distrust today is focused mainly on the Trump administration.\n\nBut Andrés Rozental, Mexico's deputy foreign minister during the NAFTA negotiations, says that if Mr. Trump continues his attacks on Mexico, it could despoil three decades of building a bilateral relationship.\n\n\"Obviously if the Mexico bashing ... and everything that we have on the bilateral agenda continue to be dealt with by the U.S. president and his government on the basis of Mexico being the 'them' against the 'us,' then I am convinced that there will be eventually a resurgence of what is a fairly latent anti-Americanism in Mexico.\"\n\nAnd yet Mexico has had to deal with foreign powers on its soil since way before its clash with America. When Cortés arrived on the Gulf coast, he aligned himself with indigenous groups against the Aztecs and felled the mighty empire in central Mexico within just two years.\n\nFive hundred years later, as the main square here fills out for independence celebrations, people stream past the Church of Jesus of Nazareth in Mexico City, many blowing whistles without looking up. It is here that the bones of Cortés have been laid to rest - after being moved around and their location kept secret for decades. Even today his resting place is hardly acknowledged: There's just a plaque, well above eye level, that reads: \"In this temple rest the remains of the conquistador Cortés, who died in 1547.\"\n\nThe people who have congregated on the benches that surround the nondescript church are using it for a place to rest or eat - tacos and tepache , a fermented pre-Hispanic beverage made from pineapple peel, raw sugar, and spices. Few know that Cortés' remains lie here, and fewer still that it's the quincentenary of his arrival in Mexico. Those who are willing to share their thoughts - and most look confused about why they are even being asked - say his place in Mexican history is unclear.\n\nJust as an older generation of Mexicans was taught in school about evil American imperialists, it was also given a black-and-white picture of Cortés. Officially, he was the villainous intruder who plundered Mexico and stole Tenochtitlán for Spain. Diego Rivera's early 20th-century murals in the National Palace depict Cortés as weak and sickly. The historic figure La Malinche, who served as his ally and interpreter and gave birth to his child - and thus the mestizo nation - is reviled. To be a malinchista in Mexico means to be a traitor to one's culture - part of the identity struggle that Paz wrote about.\n\nBut distance has given way to a more nuanced view. Blocks from Cortés' tomb lie the ruins of the Templo Mayor, one of the most sacred sites for the Aztecs. It is believed to be the spot where the Aztecs witnessed the eagle with a snake in its mouth upon a cactus - the symbol on the country's coat of arms. The stones of the Templo pyramid were used to build the imposing Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico - the backdrop for Independence Day celebrations.\n\n\"We are not pure Aztecs, nor are we pure Spaniards,\" says archaeologist Martin Robles Luengas, who works as an official guide at the Templo Mayor. \"Today as a Mexican you cannot complain of the Spaniards, because part of you is a Spaniard.\"\n\nYet questions of identity are far from settled. This year AMLO used the 500th anniversary of Cortés' arrival to write a letter to the Spanish king demanding an apology for the conquest. \"It wasn't just about the encounter of two cultures,\" he said of his request. \"It was an invasion. Thousands of people were murdered during that period. One culture, one civilization, was imposed upon another to the point that the temples - the Catholic churches - were built on top of the ancient pre-Hispanic temples.\"\n\nSome members of Morena, AMLO's political movement, went even further. One senator urged Mexicans to give up carnitas , or roasted pork tacos, since pigs were introduced to Mexico by the Spaniards. \"You should realize that every time you eat roast pork tacos, you are celebrating the fall of Tenochtitlán,\" she said.\n\nSpain dismissed AMLO's letter, and Mexicans have largely ridiculed conquest politics, not least the call to forgo pork. Many say Mexico would be better off dealing with modern discrimination against indigenous people than a centuries-old war. And yet the issue is symbolic of deeper sensitivities.\n\n\"Mexican identity is very much founded on the basis of defending our honor, from being trampled on by foreign forces,\" says Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador. \"So we were humiliated by the Spaniards who conquered the Aztec empire, we were humiliated by the United States who stole half of our territory, we were humiliated by the French. It's a long story of humiliation.\"\n\nThat story connects to a renewed sense of nationalism that is surfacing in Mexico - and it is showing up in areas other than politics and whether to eat pork. It has also led to a revival of precolonial art and sport.\n\nOn an early evening in northern Mexico City, the skies, beholden to the rainy season, threaten to open. But 20- and 30-somethings continue to arrive, heading to a stone-walled court in the back of a community center, FARO Azcapotzalco Xochikalli. The young people suit up - binding cloth around their hips, waist, and groin areas - and start passing a ball back and forth to warm up.\n\nThis is no soccer game, however. They are about to play ulama , a ballgame that dates back thousands of years and was once a high-stakes ritual in Mesoamerica. The modern iteration no longer entails human sacrifice, but it is still fierce: At more than 6 pounds, the rubber ball resembles - and feels - like a bowling ball. To move it, the players can only hit it with their hips, either bumping it in midair or lying on the concrete floor and sweeping it down the court with a pelvic thrust.\n\nIn some variations, the object is to put the ball through stone hoops, 20 feet in the air, on either side of the court. But the team is so new that few people here have mastered the skill. Simply reaching the other team's end line is the goal at this point.\n\nChantal Perez Urbina, a university student studying chemical engineering, says when she began playing ulama a year and a half ago, she had bruises and scrapes across her body. But she was compelled to keep returning to the court, despite the skepticism of her family, in a drive she talks about in almost spiritual terms. \"These are our roots. This is our origin,\" she says. \"It's an equilibrium between our energy, just like life and death, the energy moves between us in each blow. This is about rescuing my culture.\"\n\nIt's also about understanding themselves. Ulama was so integral to Aztec society that when the Spanish conquistadors arrived they immediately banned it, part of a long process of stamping out indigenous culture, from language to religion to architecture. \"They took everything from us,\" says Ms. Perez Urbina, \"even the very stones of our pyramids to build their churches.\"\n\nThe community center offers a host of other workshops built around precolonial traditions, from dance to medicine to indigenous language. But the activity that's received the most attention is ulama . \"No one thought that this workshop was going to work [with] a sport that disappeared 500 years ago,\" says Emmanuel Kakalotl, the coach, during the pickup game.\n\nMr. Kakalotl says about half of Mexico's states now field teams that play each other in tournaments. Andrea Aviles Escoto, an ulama player who took up the sport just 10 days earlier, would like to see teams in every state. She sees the resurgence of ulama as part of AMLO's Fourth Transformation. \"This is the power of Mexico,\" she says. \"Our culture, our land, and traditions - our ancestral power.\"\n\nAs AMLO nears the anniversary of his first year in office Dec. 1, it's still unclear whether he can deliver on the promises of 4T - and even what the initiative really is. In a country with deeply rooted issues that overlap - from corruption to drug violence to stark inequality - it would require a radical overhaul to address any one of them. So far analysts see little evidence that is happening beyond the rhetorical.\n\nAMLO's popularity remains high, with approval ratings of 60% to 70%. The first leftist president in modern history, he draws the bulk of his support from the working class and rural poor but also from the academic left and disillusioned voters from other political parties.\n\nA lot of his appeal lies in an everyman style - he addresses the nation every day at 7 a.m. in press conferences - and eschewing the wealth and pomp associated with earlier presidencies. He slashed his salary and put the presidential jet up for sale, for example, moves that were symbolically resonant.\n\nDr. Villegas Revueltas, the historian, says that the Fourth Transformation is right to try to complete the job of independence, reform, and revolution, to bring economic benefits to all segments of society. \"We weren't equal in 1521, nor in 2019,\" he says.\n\nBut to get there, AMLO is casting himself as a '70s-era revolutionary, Dr. Villegas Revueltas says - talking about energy, food, and economic independence. Implicit in AMLO's message is a rejection of globalization. But if he were to actually act on his words, many believe the economic consequences would be dire.\n\n\"We have a man who talks about energy independence ... about food independence - those types of things that have already failed in the past,\" Mr. Guajardo says. \"And yet there is the temptation to go back.\"\n\nIn many ways, AMLO and Mr. Trump are similar figures, although from opposite sides of the political spectrum. They both use \"us versus them\" rhetoric to rally supporters.\n\n\"They know exactly how to play to their base and what it is that fires their base up,\" says Mr. Rozental. \"In the case of Trump, it's all of this stuff about anti-immigration and then 'let's drain the swamp.' ... Here it's the same thing. 'Let's get rid of everything that we had before because it was all bad, corrupt, rotten ... and we're going to make a new transformation of Mexico.'\"\n\nThe clash of personalities could lead to a clear rupture in the bilateral relationship if not played right. But so far AMLO has been handling Mr. Trump with restraint, agreeing to do more to stanch the flow of migrants under threat of tariffs, for example, and steering clear of confrontation.\n\nPolitically this stance has not damaged him at home, but if Mr. Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric heats up, as many analysts believe it will for the 2020 election, AMLO runs the risk of looking as if he's doing the American president's bidding.\n\nThe strongest stand AMLO's government has taken thus far came in the days after the El Paso massacre, which the Spanish newspaper El País called the \"greatest racist crime against Hispanics in modern United States history.\"\n\nMexican Foreign Affairs Minister Marcelo Ebrard called the attack \"an act of terrorism\" and said that he would push to have the gunman extradited to Mexico. He is also organizing a summit of leaders from Spanish-speaking nations to address white supremacy.\n\nSuch moves have kept AMLO supporters believing that change is coming. For the first time in her adult life, Ximena Fernandez chose to go to the independence celebration this year so she could show her support for the Fourth Transformation. As regional dance exhibitions from each state dazzle the crowd on large-screen TVs, she says this year El Grito is about far more than patriotism, mariachi music, sombreros, or simply being proud of who you are.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And we don't like it because we are a country of migrants. ... We know as a people or a nation that we have this fight to come,\" she says. \"Not with anger but with, 'Hey, look at us.

Those seeking to reach the U.S. are coming from more than 100 countries, with more than 41% from outside of Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 07, 2022, 2:03 p.m. ET | Yuma, Ariz.\n\nAs hundreds of migrants line up along an Arizona border wall around 4 a.m., agents try to separate them into groups by nationality.\n\n\"Anyone from Russia or Bangladesh? I need somebody else from Russia here,\" an agent shouts and then says quietly, almost to himself, \"These are Romanian.\"\n\nIt's a routine task for the Border Patrol in the wee hours in this flat expanse of desert where the wall ends. Migrants from at least 115 countries have been stopped here in the past year, but that may be less striking than what's missing: Mexicans are virtually absent.\n\nInstead, families from Venezuela, Colombia, Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, India, and dozens of other countries arrive in Yuma after wading through the knee-deep Colorado River. Their presence reflects how a pandemic-era rule still shapes the journeys of many migrants, even though much of the United States has moved on from COVID-19.\n\nThe changing demographics mark a dramatic shift away from the recent past, when migrants were predominantly from Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle countries - Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. That's especially clear at some of the busiest crossings, like Yuma and Eagle Pass, Texas, near where several people died in recent days while trying to cross the Rio Grande.\n\nMexicans still cross elsewhere but often try to elude capture because they are likely to be expelled under a pandemic rule that denies them a chance to seek asylum.\n\nMexicans still account for 7 of every 10 encounters in the Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector, where smugglers order them to walk at night with black-painted water jugs, camouflage backpacks, and boots with carpeted soles to avoid leaving tracks in the sand, said John Modlin, the sector chief.\n\n\"Incredibly different tale of two borders, even though they're within the same state,\" Mr. Modlin said.\n\nMigrants who are not from Mexico and the Northern Triangle accounted for 41% of stops on the border from October through July, up from only 12% three years earlier, according to government data.\n\nIn Yuma, they wear sandals and carry shopping bags stuffed with belongings over their shoulders. Some carry toddlers. The migrants typically walk a short distance through tribal lands and surrender to agents, expecting to be released to pursue their immigration cases.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexicans made up 35% of all border encounters from October through July, higher than three years ago but well below the 85% reported in 2011 and the 95% at the turn of the century.\n\nIn theory, the rule that denies migrants the right to seek asylum on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19 applies to all nationalities. But in practice, Title 42 is enforced largely for migrants who are accepted by Mexico, which agreed to take in people expelled from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, as well as its own citizens.\n\nIt is difficult for the U.S. to send others to their home countries due to costs, strained diplomatic relations and other considerations. \"The challenge is what Mexico can accept,\" Mr. Modlin said. \"That's always going to be a limiting factor.\"\n\nIn Yuma, Title 42 has become almost nonexistent, with the pandemic rule being applied in only 192 of 24,424 stops in July - less than 1%. In Tucson, it was used in 71% of stops. A court order has kept Title 42 in place indefinitely.\n\nIt is unclear why routes are so divergent. U.S. officials believe inhospitable mountains and canyons near Tucson favor people trying to escape detection, while the ease of crossing in places like Yuma makes those paths better suited for families seeking to surrender.\n\n\"What we know with absolute certainty is that the smuggling organizations control the flow,\" Mr. Modlin said. \"They decide who goes where and when they go to the point. It's almost like air traffic control of moving people around.\"\n\nIn Yuma, groups of up to about two dozen migrants are dropped off by bus or car on a deserted Mexican highway and then begin arriving shortly after midnight at the edge of the imposing wall built during Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nIf English and Spanish fail, agents use Google Translate to question them under generator-powered lights, take photos, and load them onto buses.\n\nMigrants arrive over several hours on different paths, sparking concern among agents that smugglers may be trying to confuse them to sneak some through undetected.\n\nOne recent morning, six Russians said they flew from Istanbul to Tijuana, Mexico, with a stop in Cancun, and hired a driver to take them four hours to the deserted highway where they crossed.\n\nOne man who flew from his home in Peru to Tijuana said the most difficult part of the journey was the anxiety about whether he'd make it to his destination in New Jersey.\n\nNelson Munera said he, his wife, and their 17-year-old son got off a bus on the highway and crossed to Yuma because fellow Colombians had taken the same route.\n\nLazaro Lopez, who came with his 9-year-old son from Cuba by flying to Nicaragua and crossing Mexico over land, chose Yuma because that's where his smuggler guided him.\n\n\"An opportunity presented itself,\" said Mr. Lopez.\n\nThe Border Patrol drops off hundreds of migrants each day at the Regional Center for Border Health, a clinic near Yuma that charters six buses daily to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Migrants are released on humanitarian parole or with a notice to appear in immigration court.\n\nThe clinic began the airport shuttles for migrants in February 2021 and recently added buses to Washington, paid for by the state of Arizona.\n\n\"We have seen families from over 140 countries,\" said Amanda Aguirre, the health-care provider's chief executive officer. \"We haven't seen one from Mexico, not through our processing.\"\n\nThe shift is also evident on the Mexican side of the border.\n\nThe Don Chon migrant shelter in nearby San Luis Rio Colorado fills many of its roughly 50 beds with Central Americans who were expelled under Title 42.\n\nKelvin Zambrano, who arrived in a large group of Hondurans, said he fled threats of extortion and gang violence. Border Patrol agents wouldn't let him share his story, he said.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Critics say the video treats women as props - and sends the message that this class of so-called Mexican \"juniors,\" or elite youth, gets to party, play, and go on to inherit positions of power.\n\nIn Mexico, as elsewhere, rich kids are assumed to get whatever they want. But it's a particularly sensitive subject here. Corruption and bad behavior often go unpunished among the powerful, something top of mind for many here after a six-month run of government scandals ranging from apparent kickbacks from big business to nepotism in hiring practices.\n\nAnd a rising middle class (17 percent of 114 million Mexicans joined the middle class between 2000 and 2010, according to the World Bank) with access to social media and mobile technology feels empowered to call out bad behavior that's historically slipped below the public radar.\n\n\"It [the video] says a lot,\" says Vicki Galacia, a preschool teacher walking her dog in a Mexico City park. \"No matter what we protest against now, there are more people who think they're above the law that are\" growing up to be our next leaders.\n\nThe video is a constant topic in Mexican editorials and on social media.\n\n\"What message do they want to send? Basically that they have loads of money . And that they couldn't care less about what any of us might think of them,\" Mexican media critic Susana Moscatel wrote in Milenio Noticias. She says the only good that comes out of videos like these - which she says are a tradition at the school and are typically professionally produced - is that they offer an \"unadulterated look at how many of these people see the world.\"\n\nIn the video, a stream of young woman appear before a panel of bored, dismissive young men who are \"casting\" for their graduation party. It's pretty PG - no explicit sex or violence - but it stereotypes women as being crazy, ditzy, and subservient.\n\nIf this video has any silver lining , it's that \"society is aware and is getting upset at the portrayal of women as objects,\" María Lucero Jiménez Guzmán, a political and social science researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México told El Universal, a daily in Mexico City.\n\nIn recent years, calling out bad behavior by \"Juniors\" or \"Mirreyes\" (a play on \"My King,\" a pet name used by many upper class parents for their sons) has gone mainstream.\n\nTake the 2013 case of \"Lady Profeco.\" The daughter of Mexico's then-attorney-general for consumer protection threw a fit at a hip restaurant when she wasn't given the table she wanted. The restaurant, Maximo Bistrot - a cozy space where it's hard to imagine a \"bad\" table ­- held its ground; the woman threatened to have her father shut them down. Sure enough, officials showed up almost immediately, prepared to shutter the joint.\n\nBut thanks to the documentation and tweets of a number of diners, not only did the restaurant stay open, but the woman's father was fired and she was named and shamed on social media.\n\nThere are many other such stories, including a high-profile drunk driving incident when a politician (who inherited leadership over Mexico's Green Party from his father) tried to pay his way out of a ticket , according to local media. Mexicans subsequently discovered that he had only been held by police for a few hours, instead of the mandatory 24 hours.\n\nBut can we really blame these Mirreyes , asks Salvador Camarena in an opinion for newspaper El Financiero. There are so many examples of poor behavior by Mexico's elites that go unpunished; these kids grew up understanding one shouldn't \"fight success,\" he writes.\n\nThree days after the graduation video's release, the school put out a statement. \"The community of Mexico's Cumbres Institute apologizes for the content of the video, which has offended and angered many people. This video in no way represents the values and principles of the high school, its students, families, and alums,\" it read.\n\nThe school said it \"didn't know about the video's content\" and is preparing to take action, though didn't get into specifics.\n\nA campaign on Change.org, signed by more than 15,000 people, is trying to inject a little more global awareness into these kids' lives: It's petitioning for 180 hours of required gender studies and human rights courses for the 2015 graduating class at Cumbres.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But what exactly is a course on human rights going to do, he asks.\n\n\"Maybe the problem is that this course isn't taught in all primary schools,\" Mr. Hill writes. \"I wonder, though, would this short course in primary, secondary, or high school make any difference if, once at home, parents and children laugh together at the content.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

[+] called 'Serenade to Break the Wall' against US President Donald Trump's immigration policies. / AFP PHOTO / Pedro PARDO (Photo credit should read PEDRO PARDO/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nI can trace my ancestry to La Grulla, a small community just west of McAllen, on the Texas side of the Rio Grande. My ancestors settled there in the 1830s -- a decade before Texas became a state. They pre-date the ancestors of most current Texans.\n\nOf course, when my family settled in La Grulla, it was part of Mexico. They became residents of the United States after the U.S. government was given their land -- or stole it, depending on your point of view -- in 1848.\n\nMy family settled in what is now the United States decades before President Trump's ancestors arrived. In other words, we \" Mexicans \" did not immigrate to the United States. We lived on U.S. land before it was U.S. land. And we 're not going away.\n\nThe chanting of \"Build that Wall\" at Trump campaign rallies and in our schools was disappointing. Even more insulting was Trump's accusation that Mexican immigrants are \"criminals and rapists.\"\n\nBut these are only the latest salvos in the U.S. government's centuries-long track record of anti-Mexican sentiment.\n\nA little history. In the early 1800s, with a passion for expansionism fueled by Manifest Destiny, the United States craved a passage to the Pacific Ocean -- and by extension, the shipping routes to Asia.\n\nBut Mexico inconveniently stood in the way. So the United States invaded. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two-year Mexican-American War in 1848 and ceded present-day Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming to the United States.\n\nThe United States realized its \"destiny\" and secured its pathway to the Pacific. But it also inherited the hundreds of thousands of Native Americans and millions of Mexicans who had long lived on that land.\n\nIt was an immigration problem of the U.S. government's own making.\n\nThe U.S. Army responded to Native Americans with involuntary removals and reservations. From 1864 to 1866, nearly 10,000 Navajo and Apache people were forced to walk 450 miles to a camp in eastern New Mexico. The reservation didn ' t have adequate shelter or food. Over 2,300 Navajo and Apache died before the Army allowed survivors to move back home.\n\nDealing with the much larger group of Mexicans -- many of them landowners, office-holders, entrepreneurs, lawyers, bankers and members of the clergy -- was more complex. The government couldn' t consign them to reservations.\n\nTheir customs, language, traditions, values, culture, food and communities all became part of who we are as a nation -- whether the U.S. government liked it or not.\n\nBut the U.S. government still did its best to make its newest citizens foreigners in their own land and unwelcome in their own country. Congress passed the Homestead Act in 1862, allowing Americans to apply for Western land in exchange for farming on it -- taking land that belonged to Mexicans .\n\nLater, during the Great Depression, the United States deported almost 2 million Mexicans . More than half of them were U.S. citizens.\n\nDespite this history of bigotry, discrimination and exclusion, we 're still here , contributing to American society and the economy. Latinos have $1.5 trillion in purchasing power. Latino-owned businesses were responsible for 86% of small business growth from 2007 to 2012. That means we created a whole lot of jobs, for Latinos and non-Latinos alike.\n\nAnd there is no wall high enough or long enough to exclude us from this country's future. By 2060, one in four Americans is projected to be Hispanic. We 're not confined to our ancestral home in the Great Southwest. The fastest-growing Latino communities are in North Dakota, Alabama, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, South Dakota and Utah.\n\nPresident Trump is seeking to close the stable door a century and a half after the horse has bolted. Mexicans are here -- in our homeland -- to stay. Nearly 33 million Latinos were born in this country. We were here before many of our fellow citizens arrived. And a fence, a wall, a moat, or a river will serve only to keep us in, not out."

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nBy John Tamny ,\n\nContributor.\n\nTOPSHOT - Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks about ... More immigration and border security near Coronado National Memorial in Montezuma Pass, Arizona, August 22, 2024. (Photo by OLIVIER TOURON / AFP) (Photo by OLIVIER TOURON/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe view here is that mass deportation of Mexicans from the United States will ultimately result in quite a few more Mexicans searching for a way to get to the United States than before. It's basic economics. Regardless of ideology, please read on.\n\n\"I build their dream houses. That means I depend strictly on the U.S. economy.\" Those are the words of Crispin Agustin Mendoza, mayor of Alcozauca in Mexico. It comes from reporting by Simon Romero, of the New York Times . Some on the right will reject the reporting by Romero as propaganda at the Times , but it's better to consider the meaning of what Romero is reporting.\n\nMendoza builds houses paid for by remittances from Mexican workers in the United States, and the houses he builds in Alcozauca are strictly a function of Mexican productivity within the U.S. economy. Stop and think about that.\n\nWhat it signals firstly is contra the popular view that Mexicans are crossing over into the United States in order to attain welfare, the more realistic story, one that Americans visibly see, is that they're coming to the U.S. to work. Annual dollar remittances to Mexico from Mexicans working in the U.S. of an estimated $63 billion are indicative of this truth.\n\nWhat the remittances further signal is that as opposed to openness to Mexican workers potentially leading to a massive inflow, it's more likely that Mexicans presently working in the U.S. actually limit the inflow of quite a few more. The aforementioned remittances are indicative of this speculation. Precisely because so much dollar wealth flows back to Mexico, a high number of Mexicans don't need to find their way to the United States exactly because remittances sustain them in Mexico.\n\nWhich is why those cheering planned deportations of Mexican workers should perhaps be careful what they wish for. If deportations actually succeed, the economic impact on the Mexican economy will be devastating. Think the $63 billion in estimated annual remittances.\n\nWith a not insubstantial piece of Mexico's economy reliant on production stateside, a cessation of those inflows will logically impoverish a big number of those formerly sustained directly by remittances. Beyond that, think of the businesses and workers within Mexico similarly sustained by those remittances.\n\nIf they cease, the result will be more economic desperation within Mexico, not less. From there, readers need only stop and contemplate what the effect of economic desperation is: migration to where there isn't desperation. Think the United States. Deportation will paradoxically increase urgency within the Mexican population to get to the United States.\n\nTo which some will respond that President-elect Trump's border czar Tom Homan means business, and will not allow the inflows of people that past presidents have. Ok, but how?\n\nSeemingly forgotten by conservatives in their support of deportation, walls, enhanced border security, and other deterrents is that none of this will come cheap. Which raises the obvious question of how much conservatives will countenance the growth of a great deal more government necessary to keep increasingly desperate Mexicans out of the United States.\n\nWhich is why conservatives should arguably be circumspect in cheering on Homan, along with any policy meant to suffocate the market signal that is Mexican citizens choosing to work in a United States. Markets always speak, and if Mexican labor stateside that sustains people and economy in Mexico is suffocated, the costs to the U.S. economy in terms of productivity and a soaring cost of government will be immense. And may paradoxically result in more Mexicans finding their way to the U.S. despite costly efforts to keep them out."

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Stuart Anderson writes about immigration, business and globalization.\n\nBy Stuart Anderson ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer checks identifications as people cross into the United ... More States from Mexico on September 23, 2016, in San Ysidro, California. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nMexican immigration to the United States encourages increased trade and investment, enhancing prosperity in both countries, according to new research. Most political discourse over immigration from Mexico to the U.S. has been emotional, with U.S. elected officials using heated political rhetoric and focusing on illegal entry. The research suggests Americans should look beyond the rhetoric and focus on economic facts.\n\n\"We find a generally positive and significant relationship between Mexico-U.S. migration and Mexico-U.S. imports, exports, and inward FDI [foreign direct investment] from the U.S. to Mexico,\" concluded economists Michael Gove and Liliana Meza González. Gove is an economics professor at the University of North Georgia, and González is a professor and researcher in the international studies department at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City.\n\nIn their research , the two economists examined 10 years of data, from 2008 to 2017, to estimate the \"potential contribution of migration to international trade and foreign direct investment.\" Gove and González concluded: \"Migration complements trade and inward foreign direct investment, and point to transnationalism as a central factor that leads to migration's positive contribution.\"\n\nRonald Reagan proposed a North American free trade agreement. \"The original idea was from Ronald Reagan,\" said Agustín Barrios Gómez, a former federal congressman and diplomat from Mexico. \"He proposed it to José López Portillo, our president at the time . . . The reason he (Reagan) proposed a free trade agreement with Mexico was he knew that American prosperity and national security directly depend on a stable and cooperative Mexico. Without a stable and cooperative Mexico there is no American superpower.\"\n\nThe original North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA FTA ) contained some measures to encourage the free movement of foreign professionals between the United States and Mexico and Canada. However, Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton knew it would not be possible to gain Congressional approval if the pact also included broader immigration provisions to allow more Mexicans to work legally in the United States.\n\nIllegal immigration from Mexico is primarily caused by the limitations on legal avenues for Mexicans to work in the United States. President George W. Bush attempted to rectify that through a proposed U.S.-Mexico migration agreement that included expanded work visas and broader immigration enforcement cooperation between the two countries. An agreement neared completion, but after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, it would have been impossible to gain Congressional approval, and the effort was largely abandoned before becoming a formal pact.\n\nDonald Trump's vision of Mexican immigrants differed from earlier presidents. In his first speech as a presidential candidate, Trump said many Mexicans were rapists who would commit crimes against Americans . That became part of a central message of his campaign. In contrast, in a book published in 2021, George W. Bush, who served as president from January 2001 to January 2009, wrote about the family values and work ethic of Mexican immigrants.\n\nTrump threatened to end NAFTA, though ultimately it was renamed and updated , with parts becoming more \"managed trade\" rather than \"free trade.\" Trump gained leverage over Mexico on immigration enforcement not by an agreement to admit more Mexican workers legally but by threatening to harm Mexico's economy with punitive tariffs .\n\n\"The transnational networks that link migrants to their country of origin generally promote economic activities that benefit both the U.S. and Mexico, a result that has policy implications both in Mexico and in the U.S.,\" according to Gove and González.\n\nThe economists make several policy recommendations. First, the United States should \"increase the avenues for more regular migration from Mexico.\" Gove and González favor increasing visas for skilled and unskilled temporary workers from Mexico.\n\n\"Expanded temporary worker programs, properly constructed, will aid economic growth and enhance border control efforts and national security,\" according to Senate testimony delivered in March 2015 by Randel K. Johnson on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Johnson, now a distinguished immigration fellow at Cornell Law School, said, \"The current existing temporary worker programs are extremely difficult to use and are capped at unrealistically low levels.\"\n\nAccording to Gove and González, providing more opportunities for Mexican workers to become permanent residents in the U.S. would promote more trade and investment and raise living standards in both countries. Additional investment in the human capital of those who come to the United States also would help both nations. \"To promote beneficial economic dynamics in the country tied to the migration flows to the U.S., the Mexican government could emphasize the quality of education and the use of remittances in the human capital of the potential migrants,\" they write.\n\nGove and González conclude that U.S. and Mexican societies are closely connected. Their research finds that Mexican immigration to the United States benefits both countries."

      "text": "What A Poor Mexican Fisherman Taught Me About Time And Happiness\n\nBy Chuck Bolotin\n\nBy Chuck Bolotin ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nChuck Bolotin with Pemex gas station attendants in Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of traveling, or better yet, of living in a different country, is to be able to see how others live their lives and to compare it with how we live ours. If we are open to it, we can gain perspective and insight, not only into the human condition in general, but more directly, into our own condition.\n\nI'll give you an example.\n\nWhile on a road trip through Mexico for almost a year, I noticed repeatedly that, especially in the poorer villages, virtually all the Mexicans I saw in interactions with each other appeared to be happy. There was, as the French call it, a joie de vie , or \"joy of life,\" and a lightness to their attitude. Now that I've settled down here in Mexico to run Best Mexico Movers , when our team unloads our clients' household goods, I almost always see a lot of joking and spirited cooperation among the team members. A client even pointed this out to me, using another French phrase, esprit de corp , or a spirited cooperation.\n\nI have noticed that, compared with the US, the workers / laborers everywhere here in Mexico joke and kid each other a lot. When walking past a construction site, it is not unusual in any way to hear several of the workers singing (loudly) along with the radio. You'll see this spirit in lots of places, whether encountering Mexicans here in their little stores, or when walking their children to school. They seem to be genuinely content and socially connected. Not the fake, perfunctory \"how are you / I really don't care\" type of socially connected, but the \"genuinely happy, joking with each other, greeting each other warmly as if the other person mattered\" socially connected. On\n\nTacos Being Made in Lo de Marcos, Nayarit, Mexico\n\nsome level, this even extends to complete strangers, for example, me. When I walk through some village where no one knows me, I almost always receive acknowledgements, warm smiles and several instances of \"buenos dias\" or \"buenas tardes\".\n\nBut from my typical North of the Border perspective, this made no sense. From how I was used to looking at it, these people lived in tiny little houses and had very little in the way of material goods. So wouldn't it naturally follow that their relative material poverty would make them relatively miserable? Poor = unhappy, right?\n\nBut what I was seeing with my own eyes told me the opposite.\n\nThe situation was so different from what I expected that I couldn't help but compare what I saw in these areas in Mexico with what I saw when I was in much wealthier, large First World cities, such as New York City, Chicago, or Tokyo. In those places, I would generally see people with strained looks on their faces, most likely over-scheduled and late, hurrying from one place to another, seemingly not very happy and certainly not very relaxed. When they encountered each other in the street, their concern was not to say \"hello\" and spend some time inquiring about each other's relatives, but rather to figure a way to get past the other person, and to do so as quickly as possible. The other person was viewed more as an obstacle than as a human being.\n\nCould some of this be because I was spending a lot of my time in Mexico in the more\n\nJet Metier with Jane in Cordoba, Mexico\n\nrural, more traditional areas? Perhaps, but that didn't account for all of it. There was an overall a cultural difference as well.\n\nComparing the attitudes of what I saw in Mexico to what I saw in the US reminded me of the Spanish word that the people south of the US border use for \"to worry about\", which is \" preocuparse ,\" and which seems to me to come from the root of \"to be preoccupied.\" In our Developed World quest for material goods, most pronounced in the larger cities, have we traded a portion of our free time and with it, some of our humanity, in exchange for the more \"nose to the grindstone\" activity of acquiring material goods? Of course, we have. But in the bargain, have we made ourselves more preoccupied / worried / unhappy? And what is the objective of working for all these material goods, anyway? Isn't the objective of acquiring more material goods to be happier?\n\nAn economist may argue that the people in these little, poorer villages were \"freeloading\" off of the advancements made by those preoccupied First World people with their more hurried, self-important lives and their grim determination, which is true. People who are not working as seriously and instead, are more light-heartedly enjoying each other's company are not developing cures for diseases, or even figuring\n\nJet Metier at ease at a restaurant in Chapala, Mexico\n\nout how to have clean water and enough food to eat, etc., without which no one would be very happy. And you, too, may be personally less happy when your light-hearted, easy-going, singing plumber shows up two hours late to fix your drain because he got distracted when talking with a friend. So there are trade-offs. We just have to understand where the trade-offs are and then know where to make these trade-offs.\n\nHere's what I see as the trade-off: time not focused on making money (what I will call \"free time\") vs. material success. For conceptual clarity, we can view it as a continuum, with more free time on one end of the continuum and more material success on the other. The more free time you have, all other things being equal, the less material goods you will acquire. The more material goods you acquire, the more free time you had to give up in order to acquire them.\n\nWe don't think a lot about this continuum, unless, as a result of being in another country or place, you see people at a significantly different place on the continuum\n\nJet Metier with air conditioning repairman in Lo de Marcos, Nayarit, Mexico\n\nthan where you are. For me, this has been one of the benefits of living in Mexico. As I observed these people who chose a different place on this continuum than my friends and me north of the border, it made sense to ask myself, \"Where is the best place on this continuum for me?\"\n\nWouldn't it make sense for you to ask yourself the best place on this continuum for you as well?\n\nThis all reminds me of a parable I was told more than 30 years ago. (I tend to remember these types of things and then apply them when it is most appropriate.).\n\nThe story begins with an investment banker on a vacation in Mexico who, after taking his ulcer medicine, jamming down a hurried breakfast he didn't enjoy and making several tense phone calls to the office very early in the morning, on the advice of his doctor, uncharacteristically took a walk down the beach from his $600 per night hotel room. There, he comes across a poor Mexican fishing village where he notices a particular fisherman who had come in hours before the others but had three times as many fish, and who was leaving his boat to go home. Being naturally inquisitive, the investment banker stopped the fisherman and asked him how he caught so many more fish than the other fishermen.\n\nJet Metier with people on the beach in Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\n\"I have a secret technique, señor, that I use to catch lots of fish easily.\"\n\nThe investment banker was intrigued, but he was also perplexed. \"OK. So, if you can catch so many more fish so easily, why don't you go back out for a second or third run? Then, you could bring back even more.\"\n\n\"I would rather come home early.\"\n\nTaking a beat to digest the answer he just heard, even more confused and a bit incredulous, the investment banker asked, almost shouting, \"Well, what in the world do you do when you come home early?\"\n\nFinding the investment banker to be a bit unpleasant and intense, but still wanting to be polite, very calmly, the fisherman replied, \"I can be with my kids. Later, after I have a big lunch with my family, I take a nap and have enough time to stroll along the beach with my wife. If I made several trips back out to fish, I wouldn't be able to do that.\"\n\nThe investment banker was aghast and a bit appalled that the fisherman was leaving so much potential profit on the table. Composing himself, as if talking to a child who just didn't \"get it\", he said, \"Listen. Here's what we'll do. You tell me the technique. I'll hire a bunch of high-end IP lawyers to get a patent with the exclusive rights. If anyone infringes on our patent, we'll sue the pants off them! Then, I'll go to New York to raise some investment capital, we'll buy a fleet of boats, train the crews, set up distribution worldwide, go public, and cash out for a fortune!\"\n\n\"How long would this take and now much time would I need to work?\"\n\n\"I guess it would take five or six years and you would work seven days a week, 12 hours\n\nJet Metier at Playa Tecolote, Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nper day. But after that, you'll be rich!\"\n\n\"And after I'm rich, what would I do then, señor?\"\n\n\"Well, with all that money, you would come home early and be with your kids. Later, after you have a big lunch together with your family, you can take a nap and have enough time to stroll along the beach with your wife.\"\n\nNow that I've seen this in person (and I'm getting older), this story means a lot more to me."

      "text": "Nearshoring Has Become A Trending Topic For Mexicans, What's Next?\n\nBy Lala Elizondo\n\nBy Lala Elizondo ,\n\nForbes Councils Member.\n\nLala Elizondo , Managing Partner of Tule Capital, Startup advisor and Business Consultant. She sits on the board of Endeavor Mexico North.\n\nNearshoring is the practice of outsourcing business processes to neighboring or nearby countries. It can offer cost savings, access to skilled talent and better control over operations when compared to offshoring.\n\nIn the past few years, due to a shift in economic relations between the U.S. and China, as well as other political and economic circumstances, more and more companies are establishing their operations on the Mexican border states with the U.S. This is a phenomenon that started about two years ago, but it is now what everyone seems to be talking about on my business trips to Mexico.\n\nHowever, I believe that Mexico has a lot of work to do to position itself as an optimal place for U.S. companies wanting to tap into the country's skilled workforce and benefit from its geographical proximity.\n\nI recently returned from an event organized by Forbes in Monterrey, Mexico, that focused heavily on nearshoring topics. I'm pleased to see that this concept, which has been on some people's minds for years, is more universally relevant and on people's lips (at least on the Mexican side). Undoubtedly, the government of Nuevo León, along with other stakeholders, has done a great job, and the confirmed investment in the new Tesla plant in Mexico helped spread the word. But what comes next?\n\nAs a Mexican living \"across the border\" and being well connected in the tech community in Austin and the commercial real estate community in Dallas and Houston, I realize that there is still a lot of work to be done to create awareness of the growing collaborative opportunities between both countries-particularly on the American side.\n\nHow can Mexican production position itself as top of mind on the American side? It still happens to me that when I'm in Austin attending venture capital, tech or real estate events, I tell someone that I moved from Monterrey, and in 80% of the cases people respond with \"from Monterey, California?\" No one can believe that it's just a seven-hour drive from Austin to Monterrey.\n\nWith projects like Scale Up Nation, led by Rogelio de los Santos, which includes specific initiatives such as the Expedition Building in Distrito Tec or the Venture Café, the city of Monterrey is slowly laying the groundwork and adding the ingredients to ride this wave.\n\nIndependent efforts have been made as well to position Nuevo León in Texas. In 2021, INCmty organized an event aimed at promoting collaboration between the border state and the northern region of Mexico.\n\nAnd during the past South by Southwest conference and festival, a similar event was organized with much more attendance than the first one. But I don't think one event per year is enough, and the attendees were mostly Mexican. There is still a long way to go to be on the minds of the average American business stakeholder.\n\nI would love to see an office of the Mexican federal government and/or the border states established in Texas, specifically in Austin or Dallas, whose main function is to promote different collaboration initiatives between both regions and attract investments from the \"golden Texan triangle\" to northern Mexico.\n\nThe office could collaborate with different chambers or relevant sectors in nearshoring, promoting opportunities through informative sessions and industry networking events. This office could not only focus on manufacturing issues but also on tech talent.\n\nCurrently, I find that very few Americans consider Mexico as an option to recruit quality talent in areas such as data science and machine learning, considering instead Middle Eastern countries or Canada as their first choice in these fields.\n\nAlthough the state government of Nuevo León has shown great progress and has become the state that attracted 50% of the investment in production centers in 2022 due to nearshoring, it is regrettable that Tamaulipas, another border state with enormous potential and a major port like Altamira, has not managed to attract any new investment through nearshoring.\n\nTo promote its nearshoring efforts in the U.S., businesses and organizations in Mexico can take several steps. First, the country can improve its business climate by simplifying processes and offering tax incentives. I also believe Mexican business leaders can help by emphasizing the country's advantages such as geographical proximity, skilled workforce and cost-effectiveness.\n\nAs a part of this, collaboration with trade organizations can connect Mexican and U.S. businesses while investment in educational programs can enhance workforce skills. Moreover, things like establishing special economic zones with incentives, improving infrastructure and sharing success stories are all effective marketing strategies.\n\nLeaders should look to foster collaboration and partnerships while providing support through incentives and customized services. These measures can further position Mexico as an attractive nearshoring destination for U.S. companies.\n\nOverall, the winds look to be favorable for Mexico, but it is up to businesses and the government to take advantage of them. If the Mexican government or affiliated organizations fail to establish a constant and active presence in the United States, I don't see them turning the nearshoring trend into a real and sustainable opportunity.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

      "text": "The 10 Most Corrupt Mexicans Of 2013\n\nBy Dolia Estevez\n\nBy Dolia Estevez ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAlarming levels of corruption in government, the judiciary and law-enforcement, earned Mexico the 2013 title of one of the two most corrupt countries in Latin America, according to the Global Corruption Barometer released in July by Transparency International , an anti-corruption nonprofit group. Mexico shares its rank with Argentina.\n\nIn the group's Global Corruption Barometer of 2013, Mexico's political parties, police, legislature and judiciary were perceived as the most corrupt, with 91%, 90%, 83% and 80% negative views on corruption.  The report, which is based on a survey of  114,000 people in 107 countries, offers a warning that the abuse of power, secret dealings and bribery continue to ravage societies around the world. In  Mexico corruption cases are rarely prosecuted.\n\nA serious drag on Mexico's development and a significant obstacle to Mexico achieving a functional democracy, corruption has long been a part of the country's political culture. Carlos Hank González, the deceased founder of the powerful Grupo Atlacomulco, which masterminded Enrique Peña Nieto's run for president, once said: \"A politician that is poor is a poor politician.\" For many Mexican politicians, his motto became the Bible.\n\nThe following is a list of the 10 Mexicans perceived to be among the  most corrupt in 2013. I appreciate the input received from colleagues and academics during the process of compiling this list.\n\nElba Esther Gordillo Former teacher's union leader known as La Maestra (the Teacher) was charged in February with embezzling $200 million from union funds to pay for her lavish lifestyle . She is notorious for her $5,000 Hermes bags and expensive plastic surgeries in California clinics. Three residences connected to Gordillo have been identified in California. The main one, where the now jailed teacher spent most of her time, is a $4.7 million house on a cul-de-sac in Coronado Cays that features a private dock with a boat and jet ski.\n\nCarlos Romero Deschamps is the powerful Pemex workers union leader and one of the most notorious PRI members long suspected of influence-peddling for personal enrichment. Paulina Romero, his daughter, displays on Facebook her travels around the world in private jets --accompanied by her three English bulldogs Keiko, Boli and Morgancita-- her voyages on yachts, dining in first class restaurants and sporting $12,000 Hermes luxury bags. Her brother drives a $2 million limited edition red Enzo Ferrari sport car, a gift from their father, whose trade union monthly salary is $1,864. Romero Deschamps, a federal senator, is reported to have a \"cottage\" in Cancun with a value close to $1.5 million. According to political analyst Denise Dresser , in 2011 he received $21.6 million for \"aid to the union executive committee\" and $15.3 million from union dues. My \"hands are clean,\" Romero Deschamps claims. The Peña Nieto administration seems to agree. He is not under investigation.\n\nRaúl Salinas de Gortari is largely responsible for destroying his brother Carlos Salinas de Gortari's presidential legacy by becoming a symbol of corruption and impunity. Raúl spent ten years in jail convicted of a high-profile political homicide, but was acquitted in 2005. In July, a Mexican judge exonerated him on the final charge pending against him of \"unlawful enrichment\" and ordered $19 million dollars deposited in twelve bank accounts and 41 properties be returned to him. The decision outraged Mexicans . It was perceived as one more proof of abuse of power by Mexican elites.\n\nGenaro García Luna was the powerful Secretary of Public Security (SSP) under the Calderón Administration. With the biggest budget assigned to his department and a blank check from Calderón, García Luna was the most feared cabinet member. His tenure was marked by an excess of spending for self-promotion and abuse of power scandals exposed by the Mexican press. In her book Narcoland: The Mexican Drug Lords and their Godfathers , award-winning journalist Anabel Hernandez links García Luna with the country's top drug capos, including J oaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzman , leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. García Luna allegedly threatened to have Hernandez killed . In 2012, convicted drug kingpin Edgar \"La Barbie\" Valdez Villareal claimed that García Luna had been on the payroll of drug trafficking groups for ten years. The Peña Nieto Administration dissolved the SSP. García Luna has not been seen since he left office in 2012. He is believed to be living in Miami but reporters have not been able to find him . There is no known investigation against him in Mexico or the U.S.\n\nUPDATE Dec. 18: Genaro García Luna broke his one-year self-imposed silence in a December 17 letter to Steve Forbes to say that the \"value judgments\" about him in this article \"are lies and they lack journalistic rigor.\" He charges that the \"source on which they are based is false.\" The \"source\" he seems to be referring to is the book Narcoland: The Mexican Drug Lords and their Godfathers (Verso 2013), by award-winning Mexican journalist Anabel Hernandez. In the letter to Steve Forbes, the man in charge of conducting the bloody war on drugs during the Calderón administration lists medals and merits bestowed upon him by world governments and international organizations as proof of the results of his public performance. He claims that what he describes as \"disinformation and discrediting campaigns\" against him are due to his having \"hurt drug trafficking and kidnapping structures\" in Mexico.\n\nGarcía Luna's \"clarification letter\" was reprinted in various Mexican media on Tuesday, hours after being sent to Forbes, under headlines such as García Luna, who has more than a year without appearing, accuses Forbes of lying and says he is not corrupt.\" ]\n\nAndrés Granier , former PRI governor of Tabasco, was arrested by Mexican federal law-enforcement in June on charges of corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and money laundering. In a taped conversation leaked to the media, Granier bragged about owning 400 pairs of shoes, 300 suits and 1,000 shirts, bought from luxury stores in New York and Los Angeles. His yearly salary as governor was $92,000. His successor discovered that $190 million was missing from state coffers. He was also indicted by the Tabasco authorities. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nTomás Yarrington is a former PRI governor of Tamaulipas. He was indicted in early December on racketeering and money laundering charges in Texas. Yarrington allegedly took large bribes from major drug trafficking groups in Tamaulipas, including the Gulf Cartel, in return for letting them operate freely during his administration (1999-2004). Yarrington's lawyers say that the charges are based on false accusations by people trying to bargain with U.S. prosecutors. The U.S. has not asked Mexico for his arrest and extradition. His whereabouts are unknown.\n\nHumberto Moreira is the former PRI governor of Coahuila state. During his administration (2005-2011), the debt of the state increased from $27 million to $2.8 billion , creating the state's worst financial crisis in history. The debt scandal forced Moreira's resignation first as governor and later as head of the PRI. Jorge Torres López, who took over as an interim governor, was charged with conspiracy to launder money and other financial crimes in Texas in November. Moreira has not been charged. He is living with his family in an upscale neighborhood in Barcelona, Spain, while earning a masters degree.\n\nUpdate Dec. 23: In a letter to Forbes following publication of this post, counsel for Humberto Moreira denied that his client was involved in any corruption scandal and requested that he be removed from this list.\n\nUpdate January 3, 2014 : In a letter to Dolia Estevez, Christian F. Zinser Cieslik, attorney for Humberto Moreira, demanded that his client be removed from this list, that the author contact everybody who has reproduced this post and ask them to amend it, and that the author reveal the methodology used to compile the list. Steve Zansberg,  counsel for Dolia Estevez at Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz, LLP, informed Mr. Zinser that she has declined his demands. Both letters are appended here:\n\nLetter from Humberto Moreira's counsel.\n\nLetter from the law firm representing Dolia Estevez.\n\nFidel Herrera , former PRI governor of Veracruz. Under his administration (2004-2010) the Zeta cartel's criminal activities thrived. Allegations about his connections to the Zetas emerged during a trial in April in Texas. An FBI agent testified that Francisco Colorado Cessa , a contractor for Mexico's state oil company Pemex, acted as an intermediary between Herrera and a founding member of the Zetas. Colorado Cessa was convicted. Herrera allegedly was bribed into allowing the Zetas to operate freely. Herrera has denied the allegations and is not under investigation in Mexico. There are unconfirmed reports that he may be sent as ambassador to Greece.\n\nArturo Montiel , former Mexico state PRI governor, uncle of Peña Nieto and member of the Grupo Atlacamulco , is accused by French citizen Maudi Versini, his former wife, of kidnapping their three children. Versini, who has custody over the children, claims that justice has been manipulated by her ex-husband to prevent her from seeing them. Montiel dropped out of the 2005 presidential race following allegations of millionaire mansions and bank transactions in Mexico and France. He is not under investigation.\n\nAlejandra Sota , former President Calderon's spokesperson, is being investigated by Mexican authorities for alleged embezzlement and trafficking of influence. She is suspected of favoring friends and former classmates with government contracts during the time she served as a top government official. She is currently attending graduate school at Harvard's Kennedy School even though she has no college degree .\n\nUpdate Dec. 23: In a letter to Steve Forbes following publication of this post, Alejandra Sota objected to being included among the ten most corrupt Mexicans of 2013 and asked for a clarification on what is said about her in this article.\n\nUpdate Dec. 15, 2014: On May 29 2014, Alejandra Sota, former President Calderon's spokesperson, was cleared by Mexico's Department of Public Performance of \"illicit enrichment\" while she was a high level official under de Calderón Administration. After an investigation into how she increased her assets while being a public servant, the now defunct agency said that her estate was consistent with her income.\n\nUpdate Dec. 22, 2014: An update made on Dec. 15, 2014 incorrectly stated that the agency that investigated Alejandra Sota is now defunct. The agency does exist though Congress approved dissolving it in 2012.\n\nTwitter: @DoliaEstevez\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This post refers to Mexico's ranking on Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer, issued in July.

      "text": "Illegal Entry By Mexicans Fell 82% In Past 10 Years\n\nBy Stuart Anderson\n\nBy Stuart Anderson ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nThe rationale for building a wall is that illegal entry by Mexicans has been increasing unabated across the U.S.-Mexico border. However, illegal entry by Mexicans, as measured by apprehensions at the Southwest border, fell by 82% between 2005 and 2015, and the numbers so far in 2016 are much the same, notes a recent study from the National Foundation for American Policy. In other words, illegal immigration from Mexico is at about a 40 year low.\n\nHistorically, apprehensions along the Southwest border are a good indicator of illegal entry. \"Despite their limitations, then, as now, INS apprehension figures are the best available indication of the degree of illegal immigration,\" noted the Congressional Research Service. In general, the fewer the apprehensions, the lower the flow of illegal immigration, while an increase in apprehensions generally means more illegal entry. Law enforcement, market conditions, demographics and the availability of legal entry all affect the illegal flow.\n\nOver the past decade, two factors have contributed to this enormous drop in attempted illegal entry by Mexicans. First, the U.S. economy slowed down leading up to the \"Great Recession\" that began in 2007. Second, demographics have played a major role in the decline of Mexicans attempting to enter the United States unlawfully.\n\n\"Undocumented migration from Mexico actually began to decline in 1999, not because of border enforcement, but because of that country's demographic transition,\" according to Douglas S. Massey, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University and co-director of the Mexican Migration Project. \"From a fertility rate of around seven children per woman in the 1960s, Mexican fertility fell rapidly in subsequent years and today stands at 2.25 children per woman.\" Massey explains that, \"The fertility rate is important because migration is undertaken by young people. The probability of migration rises sharply in the teens, peaks around age 20 and falls to low levels by age 30.\"\n\nIn FY 2015, there were 186,017 apprehensions of Mexicans along the Southwest border, compared to approximate 1 million apprehensions 10 years earlier in FY 2005, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. For the first 10 months of FY 2016, there were 160,196 apprehensions of Mexicans along the Southwest border.\n\nThe increase in the use of H-2A visas for agricultural workers since 2011 may have contributed to the decline in attempted illegal entry by Mexican nationals, as individuals who in the past may have attempted to enter illegally instead used the legal visa process, which is a positive development. That would follow the historical pattern. Between 1953 and 1959, a large increase in the use of the Bracero program resulted in a 95% decline in illegal entry by Mexicans, as measured by apprehensions at the Southwest border.\n\nDespite the problems with H-2A visas, the demand for labor has increased their use, with the number of H-2A visas issued rising from 55,384 in FY 2011, to 108,144 in FY 2015. Still, processing delays remain a problem for growers and industry sources note that many agricultural employers are excluded from using the visa and others struggle to meet the visa category's housing requirements.\n\nAmerica still does not possess a means for individuals to fill lower-skilled jobs with legal visas in year-round industries like construction, hotels and restaurants. The influx of children and other migrants from Central America is one manifestation of the lack of economic-based visas.\n\nParents from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador who first came to the country to work have found that increased enforcement means it is not advisable to travel back and forth. Having established economic footholds superior to those in their home countries many have sent for their children to join them to escape the violence.\n\nIf parents could work in the United States legally and travel back and forth to Central America or petition legally for their children (or spouse), then the situation of unaccompanied minors and family units appearing at the border likely would never have happened - and would not happen in the future.\n\nThe increase in enforcement personnel starting in the 1990s (along with a change in border strategy) had the unintended consequence of encouraging people to remain in the country after making it to the United States. The unauthorized immigrant population in the United States rose from 3.5 million to 11.8 million between 1990 and 2007, according to the Department of Homeland Security. During those same years, the number of authorized U.S. Border Patrol Agents increased from 3,733 to 14,923 (and is over 20,000 today). In other words, as enforcement efforts increased, so, too, did the unauthorized (illegal) immigrant population.\n\nBuilding a wall while neglecting to add new ways for individuals to work legally at lower-skilled jobs would continue the status quo. It is neither a smart, nor a new approach, to reducing illegal immigration."

      "text": "Debunking Donald Trump's Five Extreme Statements About Immigrants And Mexico\n\nBy Dolia Estevez\n\nBy Dolia Estevez ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nRepublican front-runner Donald Trump has sparked outrage among Mexicans and Latinos over comments he made when he kicked off his Presidential bid about Mexico sending its \"rapists\" and criminals to the U.S. and calling for a human-proof wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to keep them out.\n\nSince then, Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric has become more strident: he wants to deport 11.3 million undocumented workers (6 million of which are Mexicans) and strip babies born to undocumented immigrants of their birthright citizenship.\n\nHere is some data that suggest that five of Trump's most outrageous statements about immigrants, Mexico and the border do not correspond to reality.\n\nDonald Trump during his trip to the border in July. (Photo by Matthew Busch/Getty Images)\n\n1- Immigrants are no criminals. In his kickoff speech in June, Trump said that Mexican undocumented immigrants are \"rapists\" and they are \"bringing drugs and crime.\" Data shows that the real estate mogul's assertions are wrong. According to a July report by the American Immigration Council , immigration is associated with lower crime rates and immigrants are less likely than the native-born to be serious criminals.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2013, when unauthorized immigrants in the U.S.  more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.3 million, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48%-which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41%, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary.\n\nThe American Immigration Council also found that immigrants are less likely than the native-born to engage in either violent or nonviolent \"antisocial\" behaviors; that immigrants are less likely than the native-born to be repeat offenders among \"high risk\" adolescents; and that immigrant youth who were students in U.S. middle and high schools in the mid-1990 and are now young adults have among the lowest delinquency rates of all young people.\n\n2- A border wall is no solution. Trump has said repeatedly that if elected President, he will build an impenetrable 2,000 mile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep \"illegals\" out. There is already a wall in one third (650 miles) of the border. But it has been pretty much irrelevant. In fact, data indicates that it may have backfired. In an article in Foreign Policy, Princeton sociologist Douglas Massey said that evidence shows that money spent on border enforcement, wall included, \"is worse than useless - it's counterproductive.\"\n\nThe \"militarization of the border,\" as Massey calls it, made it harder, if not impossible, for immigrant workers to go back home as they did before the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was enacted. Researchers estimate that tightening of border enforcement since 1986 actually added 4 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. in 2010.\n\n3- Mexico will not pay for the wall. Throughout the course of his presidential bid, Trump has assured voters that his plan for a wall would be subsidized by the Mexican government. \"Trust me, Mexico will pay,\" the billionaire said on July 31.\n\nBut Mexican Presidential spokesperson Eduardo Sánchez called Trump's assertion that Mexico would pay for a wall \"false.\" Sánchez said: \"It reflects an enormous ignorance for what Mexico represents, and also the irresponsibility of the candidate who's saying it.\"\n\nThe idea that Mexico will pay for a blatant monument to anti-Mexican hostility defies all logic.\n\n4- Mexican immigration has declined. Trump has called the immigration situation \"completely out of control\" and has promised \"to take our country back.\" But Pew Research Center's  data shows that Mexican unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. declined by 1 million, from the 6.9 million 2007 peak to 5.9 million in 2012. Driven partly by economic and demographic factors,  net migration from Mexico reached zero in 2010, and since then more Mexicans have left the U.S. than have arrived.\n\n5- Mexico is no threat to the U.S. economy. Trump claims Mexico \"is not a friend\" because \"they're killing us economically....\" The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world, with a GDP 13 times larger than Mexico's; likewise, the U.S. per capita income is four times larger than Mexico's. With $308 billion yearly trade, Mexico's is the U.S. third largest trade partner after Canada and China. By no stretch of the imagination could Mexico be \"killing\" the U.S. economically.\n\nBut by listening to Trump, one would not know that Mexico is a friendly nation closely linked to the U.S. by geography, trade, culture and history.\n\nTwitter: @DoliaEstevez"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. U.S.-Mexico Relations; Economics, Energy, Migration, Border, Security\n\nBy The Mexico Institute ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nRoughly 88 million Mexican voters are registered to vote in their country's elections on July 1st. A significantly smaller population of voters has already begun to cast their ballots-Mexicans who live abroad. Mexican emigrants make up 12.2% of the total Mexican population, 97.33% of whom live in the United States . U.S. based Mexicans have been registering to vote in record numbers, but the overall number of registered voters abroad is unlikely to play a pivotal role in this election. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) is so far ahead in the polls that absentee ballots will not be decisive this time around.\n\nBut the growing number of Mexicans registered to vote in the U.S. and other countries holds enormous potential for the future of Mexican democracy. Including millions of Mexicans should be of interest not only to political parties and their candidates who would love to benefit from their support, but also to those who wish to see a more inclusive democratic system.\n\nAbsentee Ballot Registration Increase\n\n2018 is the first election year in which Mexico has allowed its citizens abroad to register to vote without returning to the country. Mexican nationals who have a registered voting card can go to the National Electoral Institute (INE) website and solicit a voting kit containing information and voting cards. Mexicans who did not have their voting card were able to make appointments through a Mexican consulate to obtain one to register. Mexican nationals can apply for a voter ID card regardless of their immigration status. The INE has also made efforts reach out to U.S.-based voters by increasing their absentee ballot funding and launching social media campaigns urging voters abroad to register through the online portal.\n\nLifting restrictions and greater promotion of absentee voting has facilitated the increase in registered voters outside of Mexico. As of May 2018, 181,256 Mexican nationals abroad had registered to vote, nearly triple the number from 2012. Potentially, the vote abroad could even play a determining role in a close election. Notably, in 2006, the presidency was decided by a little over 250,000 votes. The latest count shows that 4,235 voting packets have already been received in Mexico. Although Mexican law prohibits candidates from officially campaigning outside of Mexico, pre-campaign events held across the United States indicated a desire from the Mexican diasporic population to be included in their origin country's politics.\n\nVoting Process Too Difficult\n\nAlthough 2018 looked promising for bringing in more absentee votes, the voting process is not without its challenges. The small number of ballots received to date reflects the difficulties that many potential voters have faced.\n\nUnlike migrants from many other countries in Latin America, Mexicans abroad cannot vote in consulates. Instead they must mail in their votes, which often leaves room for human errors like forgotten signatures. Other difficulties stem from larger institutional problems. Despite the increase in mail-in votes, there is only one warehouse for storage, preemptively creating difficulties if a high voter mail-in rate occur. Consulates in places like Texas and California have been overrun with people seeking appointments to obtain a voter ID card. There were too many voting applicants in Dallas to process in time for the 2018 presidential election.\n\nFor those who did manage to obtain their credentials in time, delays of nearly two months were reported before their kits arrived. When they received their kits, voters reported difficulties in activation. Some kits even included the incorrect mailing address . The challenges in the voting process erode some of the progress gained in allowing Mexican nationals abroad to vote without returning to Mexico.\n\nFuture of Democracy in Mexico and Bilateral Relations\n\nBut what if these problems could be resolved in future elections to fully harness the potential of the migrant vote? While the percentage of Mexicans abroad is small, it is not insignificant. The Mexican population living abroad in 2017 was at 12,027,320, with over 11 million in the United States. If every Mexican abroad exercised their right to vote, they could substantially impact election outcomes. Yet, in 2012, only around 30,000 Mexicans in the United States voted. Although 2018 will likely have greater abroad voter turnout, the total number of registered migrant voters is only slightly higher than 1.5% of the total migrant population. The barriers to vote create a major disincentive to participate in the democratic process.\n\nNonetheless, the untapped potential of this group is considerable. This voting demographic could and should be a resource that Mexico uses as the country continues to transition to a full and mature democracy. More can be done to include absentee voters, such as growing the appointment capacity at Mexican consulates, improving the delivery process for voting packets, increasing transparency of vote counts, and communicating more effectively to voters abroad that their votes matter. It is also probably time to modify Mexican campaign laws to allow candidates to campaign in the United States as a way of attracting greater interest and participation.\n\nAn even better solution would be to permit voting in consulates. Mexico has 50 consulates in the U.S., the largest of any country abroad. These consulates have been crucial in protecting Mexican migrant rights in the U.S., and have been leaders in issuing recognized I.D.s so that Mexicans have a form of official credential. Consulates should now become centers not only for migrant rights in the U.S., but also for advancing the cause of democratic inclusion.\n\nImagine a future where more than 10 million Mexicans in the United States vote. This is not only important for election results. Mexicans abroad would be more closely tied to the political (and economic) future of their country of origin. Greater inclusion for Mexican migrants could be an important force for bilateral relations. Mexican governments would pay more attention to their citizens overseas and, in return, would likely see a stronger support network among their citizens within the United States, many of whom are also becoming American citizens. Increased migrant voting could end up being a force not just for greater democratic inclusion but also for a more positive U.S.-Mexico partnership.\n\nDuncan Wood is the Director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Chuck Bolotin relates his experiences living in Mexico with his wife.\n\nBy Chuck Bolotin ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAuthor's wife wearing a sombrero in Mexico\n\nPerhaps you've thought about moving to Mexico, or perhaps you have a loved one who is considering it.  Either way, you're almost certainly dealing with all the objections arguing against the move.\n\nWe certainly did, before we moved.\n\nFriends, family, and even almost complete strangers were very open about offering us their dire warnings, filled with concern and dread.  Oddly, almost none of them had actually lived in Mexico, but that didn't stop them from offering their advice.\n\nWhen considering whether an objection is true or not, I've generally found that it to be a good idea to know how someone else who has some firsthand experience would respond.  As a person who now has this firsthand experience, herein, if you are considering moving to Mexico or know someone who is, I offer my answers to your own concerns and those of your well-meaning but perhaps not all that well-informed friends, relatives and complete strangers.\n\n\"If it's so great in Mexico, why do all the Mexicans want to come to the US?\"\n\nWhile not all Mexicans want to come to the US, a huge percentage do, so this is a valid (albeit, overstated) objection.  In order to answer this objection, let's take a closer look at who it is who want to move from Mexico to the US.\n\nThe almost painfully obvious reason most of the people who move from Mexico to the US do so is that the vast majority are poor and believe that they can make more money and have a better life in the US than in Mexico.\n\nWe can all agree on that. But here's the follow up question: How relevant is this to your move to Mexico?  They are poor Mexicans, with limited opportunity in Mexico.  You are a US citizen, with US dollars.\n\nAnother great meal at a great price in Mexico\n\nThere's a big difference.\n\nThe life of a poor Mexican in the US may indeed be better than would be their life in Mexico, just like your life in Mexico may indeed be better than it would be in the US.\n\nAs a side note, many Mexicans are quite happy living in Mexico, especially those who are from the upper-middle class.  The reason: their lives are better in Mexico than in the US; just like yours could be, with your US dollars.\n\nDepending on your personality and other factors, you may or may not have a better life in Mexico than in the US, but the amount of Mexicans who want to enter the US has no relevance to your situation; only theirs .\n\n\"It's very violent in Mexico, so you could get killed.\"\n\nAny reasonable answer to this objection would have to admit that, on the whole, it is true that it is more violent in Mexico than in the US.  That is, unless you live in certain parts of certain US cities, which are extremely violent, but most of us don't live in those cities.\n\nHowever, just like the objection above, we need to look a bit deeper to see the extent to which this objection is relevant to you, as a US citizen living in Mexico.\n\nA lot of the crime in Mexico is cartel-related, so you have cartel members killing rival cartel members.  Do you plan on becoming a part of a Mexican drug cartel?  If you do, the possibilities for violence against you is pretty high.  In contrast, if you do not plan on becoming a cartel member, cartel-on-cartel violence may not be all that relevant to your safety, just like the violence in certain areas of Los Angeles isn't all that relevant to you if you live in the Los Angeles-area suburb of Thousand Oaks, where you can leave your doors unlocked.\n\nJet Metier selfie with Chuck Bolotin at Baja California Sur beach\n\nCould you get caught in the crossfire of a drug cartel shootout?  I suppose so, but it isn't very likely, unless you go to certain parts of Mexico.  If I were you, I would avoid those areas, just like I would avoid gang areas of the US.\n\nAbove everything else, these cartels are businesses, and it is very bad for business in Mexico to harm an American.  When an American is harmed, not only would the US government get involved, but so would all the other legitimate businesses in Mexico that make their money from US citizens, both as tourists, and as residents.  As a result, not only are US citizens not likely to be a victim of the violence problem in Mexico, but we a protected group, with everyone looking after our safety, cartels included.\n\n\"If the healthcare in Mexico is so great, why do Mexicans come to the US for treatment?\"\n\nThe answer to this is two-fold.  The first part of the answer is similar to the answer to the first objection.  By general US standards, the healthcare system in Mexico is not great... for Mexicans with very little money.  Mexico has state-run healthcare systems for their residents who are least able to pay, for which these residents are grateful, but for which a US citizen would probably not be very happy.\n\nHowever, unless you are a poor Mexican, why would you go to the healthcare system run by the government for poor Mexicans?  You are not a poor Mexican; you are a US citizen with US dollars.\n\nThe healthcare system in Mexico is two-layered; the one for the people with very little money that you would not want to visit, and the one for the people who do have money.  The one you would go to is the one for the  people who have money.\n\nThe healthcare system for the Mexicans with money and you, as an American with US dollars, is the same, and it is superb; in my opinion, far superior in cost and care to what we have in the US.  No comparison.  As an example, my insurance premium decreased more than 80% by moving to Mexico, with far superior care.  It is the norm here in Mexico for a very qualified English-speaking physician to spend an hour with you and charge you the equivalent of US $35 out-of-pocket, with no insurance.  Dental care is also 80% less or even 90% less, with highly qualified dentists using the same or better equipment than what you would expect in the US.  It's all wonderful, and removes a lot of worry that you would otherwise have in the US about getting sick and not being able to pay for it.\n\nThen why do the richest people in the world come to the US for treatment of the more exotic illnesses?  Because the US still leads the way in treating these very unusual, exotic illnesses.  For everything else (which is close to all of it), I much prefer the healthcare system I go to here in Mexico to the one in the US.  It's one of the main reasons we moved here.\n\nDog on the sand in front of sea on Baja California beach\n\nIt's too far away; I'll never see you again.\n\nThis could also be true, depending on your particular circumstance.  But it's no more true than if you moved someplace far away in the US.  For example, we live in the Lake Chapala / Ajijic area, which is 35 minutes from the international airport in Guadalajara.  To get to the airport, I drive for about 35 minutes (unlike when I lived in LA and it could take me from 40 minutes to three hours), I park right at the airport, walking distance from the terminal (as opposed to 3 miles away), and pay about $5 per day to park.  So far, so good.\n\nThen, I can fly non-stop to Los Angeles in three hours and 25 minutes, or to Dallas in two hours and 35 minutes or even to New York in five hours and twenty minutes.  Alternatively, if lived in Los Angeles and wanted to fly to New York, even after adding in the additional time to get to the airport and the cost, your flight would take five hours.  The net result is that many parts of Mexico are within just a few hours by plane to many places in the US, so by living in Mexico you may actually be closer by airplane to many parts of the US, not further away.  I might add the shortest flight to Hawaii from the US mainland is more than 5 hours, and most people don't complain too much about that.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany Americans who move to Mexico experience a much better lifestyle for much less money, are safe, their healthcare is much better and much less expensive, and they are \"airplane close\" to most places in the US.\n\nAre there downsides to living in Mexico?  You bet.  Here's just a small list of them .  I'm sure other people have additional and valid complaints.  Also, of course, living in Mexico is not for everyone, and especially those with more pronounced Type A personalities who cannot learn to slow down and go with the flow.\n\nThere are plusses and minuses to moving anywhere, especially outside of the US .  However, now at least you know the answer to four of the most common objections to moving to Mexico.  With that cleared up, you can at least make a more informed choice."

As of 2015, 98 percent of Mexican lawful immigrants to the U.S. said that they would naturalize as citizens if they could. Some 70 percent of lawful Mexican immigrants said they planned to stay in the U.S. and not return to their home country at a later date.\n\nPew Research Center surveyed Mexican immigrants to the U.S. in 2015 about barriers to citizenship.\n\nThe center found that language, along with other \"personal barriers\" was the most common reason for not applying, with 35 percent of those asked citing this. Financial and administrative barriers were cited by a further 13 percent.\n\nIt is likely that 2017 will see a surge in citizenship applications, the research found.\n\nGovernment data show there were 525,000 applications submitted during the first half of the 2017 fiscal year, which started October 1.\n\nThat marks a 21 percent rise from the 435,000 applications during the same period of 2016, itself a jump compared to the levels of applications in previous years.\n\n\"Some have posited that fiscal 2016's growth in applications and the more recent spike during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (right after the election) are attributable to anti-immigrant rhetoric associated with 2016 U.S. presidential election ,\" the research said. \"There is also evidence that some organizations worked to help lawful immigrants submit naturalization applications during the campaign.\"\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

So far, Mexico has reported roughly 475 cases and six deaths related to the novel virus.\n\nMembers of the group Sonorans for Health and Life led the blockade of the DeConcini checkpoint on Wednesday afternoon. Residents in Sonora have pledged to do it again, although they did not specify when.\n\nDuring the demonstration on Wednesday, the protesters held up signs urging Americans to \" stay at home \" while wearing face masks to protect from the virus. Although the border is already officially closed to all non-essential businesses, the protesters say that authorities have not adequately enforced the measure.\n\n\"There are no health screenings by the federal government to deal with this pandemic. That's why we're here in Nogales,\" Jose Luis Hernandez, one of the protesters, told the Arizona Republic . \"We've taken this action to call on the Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to act now.\"\n\nThe group also urged authorities to consider conducting coronavirus testing on all Mexicans being deported from the U.S.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Mexican officials for comment.\n\nThe protest comes as Mexican authorities continue to face sharp criticisms over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Miguel Barbosa, the governor of Puebla, recently drew outrage by claiming that poor Mexicans are immune to COVID-19 after reports said a large portion of those infected domestically were wealthy people who had been overseas.\n\n\"Most of them are wealthy people,\" Barbosa said. \"If you are rich you are at risk. If you are poor you are not.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump 's mass deportation policy will wreck Mexico's economy, experts have warned.\n\nTrump has vowed to conduct the largest mass deportation program in U.S. history , shut down the CBP One app , end the catch-and-release policy and reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" program as part of his immigration agenda.\n\nHis flagship immigration policy is part of an effort to \"secure the border\" and curb migration figures as well as stop the flow of drugs entering the country.\n\nA key aspect of Trump's immigration policy is the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants. He called for the deportation of individuals in the U.S. illegally, with a particular focus on those who had committed crimes.\n\nHowever, critics have pointed out that Trump's mass deportation proposal will be a huge \"blow\" to Mexico's economy , according to Ismael Plascencia López, a specialist with the Northwest Mexico Federation of Economists.\n\nExperts estimate that Mexico will need to invest millions of dollars to provide care, food, housing and transportation for deported migrants , as well as for those arriving from other countries.\n\nBanxico, Mexico's National Bank, reported that migrants in the U.S. sent $63.3 billion to Mexico in 2023. From January to October of this year alone, the amount has already reached nearly $55 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, mass deportations could cost the U.S. a staggering $315 billion for a one-time effort, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nThe long-term cost of deporting 1 million people per year could average $88 billion annually, totaling $967.9 billion over a decade. This would require a vast expansion of detention and court systems.\n\nAccording to the American Business Immigration Coalition, agricultural output will fall between $30 and $60 billion if Trump's flagship policy is enacted.\n\nLópez told Border Report: \"They're talking about deporting 11 to 13 million undocumented migrants now in the United States, it seems like an impossible task. But, if only 1 to 2 million people get deported, it would still be a huge strike on the Mexican economy.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a blow just in terms of the number of people sent here, but what about all those countries that refuse to take in their own people? They will likely end up in Mexico, you have to care for them as well.\"\n\nErnesto Castañeda, Director at Immigration Lab and the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies, and Professor at the College of Arts & Sciences and the School of International Service at American University, told Newsweek : \"Trump's promised mass deportations would impact Mexico negatively in the short term because of a decrease in the money Mexicans working in the U.S. send to their families in Mexico.\n\n\"Remittances to Mexico in 2024 surpassed 68 billion, according to the World Bank . But Mexico's population growth has decreased, the minimum wage has increased and, according to official estimates, unemployment rates in Mexico at 2.67 percent are lower than in the United States.\n\n\"So, the extra workers would strengthen the Mexican economy in the middle and long term. Mexico is currently the 12th-largest economy in the world and, with return migrants, deportees and their families, expats and international immigrants, it could grow more.\n\n\"People who lived in the U.S. return to Mexico with new skills, technical knowledge and experiences that would help Mexico's economy and society. The U.S. economy would receive the largest negative impact if around 4 million undocumented Mexicans plus some of their U.S. citizen family members were deported to Mexico. It would decrease economic output by close to 2 trillion dollars.\n\n\"Based on previous studies conducted at the Immigration Lab, I calculate that the U.S. GDP would decrease by over 6.4% after the removals of Mexicans only have taken place. People from other parts of the would also be caught in the dragnets and deported, causing further economic contraction in the United States.\"\n\nTrump-Vance transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Newsweek : \"President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families.\n\n\"The American people reelected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness. He will deliver.\"\n\nRam Ben Tzion, co-founder and CEO of the digital vetting platform Publican, told Newsweek : \"Pushing the problem across the border is not going to make it disappear. The creation of large, displaced communities, of stateless and vulnerable populations from across Latin America, presents both a risk and an opportunity on two of the most important agendas of the new administration.\"\n\nThe president-elect is expected to sign a series of executive orders on \"day one\" of his administration focusing on mass deportations and border security.\n\nAfter regaining control of the presidency and Senate , along with the House, Trump and the GOP could face minimal resistance in enacting their immigration agenda.\n\nBillal Rahman is an immigration reporter based in London, U.K. He specializes in immigration policy and border security.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nOn the final day of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a small group of Mexicans and Americans converged along a rural segment of the Rio Grande River to do something perhaps never done before: highline across a portion of the treacherous ravine.\n\nThey met - many for the first time - on January 25 along the southern border miles away from Terlingua, a small town located in the southwest portion of Texas that is home to only 50 or so people . From there, they paddled down the Rio Grande in a raft for roughly 20 miles before stopping to set-up their slackline across the canyon that acts as a natural deterrence to those who wish to cross the border.\n\nThat is, unless you know how to highline.\n\n\"It's a really beautiful symbol of trust because when you're rigging a highline, you have to entirely trust the other side,\" Kylor Melton, a member of the U.S. side who filmed the adventure, told Newsweek . \"We put our hands and our lives entirely in the trust of the other side.\"\n\nBut the experience was not about highlining or even specific immigration policies. What it was about, Melton said, was the chance to offer a more humanizing depiction of an issue that so often is politicized by the president and lawmakers thousands of miles away in Washington, D.C.\n\nA short film of the entire journey will debut Sunday morning on Melton's YouTube channel and Instagram with the hopes of allowing people to view America's neighbors to the south, in addition to other foreigners, with a new sense of understanding. A preview has already been uploaded online and can be watched below.\n\n\"For me, this isn't a highlining story. There are better, bigger highlines. This story is about two groups of people coming together to stand for what they believe,\" Melton explained. \"We see ourselves as divided. But the truth is, we're really all the same people. We just construct these walls in our mind of division. And while they are very real and the U.S.-Mexico border is very real, we just hope that people can humanize it and see these characters as humans.\"\n\nImmigration has been a pillar of President Donald Trump's campaigns and his presidency. He's often used divisive, anti-immigrant rhetoric while touting policies that would restrict legal and illegal immigration. As a candidate, he claimed the majority of Mexicans trying to come to the United States were bringing drugs, crime and were rapists.\n\nSince taking office, Trump's issued several forms of travel bans against Muslim-majority countries and implemented a \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy that separated thousands of migrant families who crossed the southern border illegally. Migrant detention facilities have come under recent scrutiny as the record-number of border apprehensions have overwhelmed government facilities and drained resources, leading to unsanitary and severely overcrowded conditions.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced a new rule that seeks to curb legal immigration by making it harder for less educated and less wealthy migrants to obtain and maintain legal status . On Wednesday, a new proposal was unveiled that would allow migrant families to be held in custody indefinitely as they await their court date, replacing a previous rule that children could not be detained longer than 20 days.\n\nBut perhaps the climax of the immigration debate came in December of last year, when portions of the federal government came grinding to a halt after spending measures failed to pass Congress because of last-minute demands made by Trump for billions of dollars in border wall funding. The stalemate carried over into the new year and a new Congress, when Democrats regained control of the House. Eventually, the feud ended after 35 days when lawmakers passed a temporary funding measure without the president's desired money for the wall, leading Trump to declare a national emergency and unilaterally reappropriate money from other departments.\n\nHowever, that was after Melton and his friends had already begun to make their idea become reality. It began when one of his friends, Corbin Kunst, who later became the leader on the U.S. side of the group, made a proposition.\n\n\"During the government shutdown, Corbin calls, and he's like, 'I have this idea, bro. I want to rig a highline between our two countries,'\" Melton recalled. \"And I was like, 'Meet at my house tomorrow.'\"\n\nThey immediately set the plan into motion, with Kunst phoning friends that he knew in Mexico.\n\nThe final video, which is set to be around 11 minutes long, elaborates less about the actual highlining experience and more about how the group came to meet and reach their destination. Once there, Knust balanced his way from the U.S. side, camera in hand. One person from the Mexico side also walked across the highline.\n\nMelton said the video has already been shown at events and festivals around the world and has received positive reactions that have humbled him. But it's yet to be released in full to the general public. In this political climate, it's something Melton hopes can give viewers a new perspective on how they see and treat other people.\n\n\"The news you hear is just flooded with negativity. I just feel bombarded. Any news channel you go to - detainment centers, immigrants being held, kids being detained, all this negativity,\" Melton said. \"This story is all about people coming together and I hope it can stand as a symbol of light in these dark, dark political times.\"\n\nRamsey Touchberry is a Washington Correspondent for Newsweek based in the nation's capital, where he regularly covers Congress.\n\nPrior to joining Newsweek in 2018, Ramsey was a multimedia reporter at the local NPR and PBS affiliate WUFT News in Gainesville, Florida.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said in an address that she would respond to new U.S. tariffs with her own \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" on Sunday, March 9, according to comments reported by local media.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump imposed on March 4 a 25 percent tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports and also raised tariffs to 20 percent on China. Trump had threatened tariffs over problems with the border, such as the trafficking of drugs like fentanyl .\n\nSheinbaum called on Mexicans to gather in Mexico City's Zócalo-its main square-at noon that day so she can \"share with them the actions that we will undertake and together face this challenge,\" Mexican newspaper Reforma reported.\n\nThe Mexican president said the \"damage\" tariffs will cause affects both Mexicans and Americans, and will result in higher prices and fewer jobs. \"No one wins with this decision,\" Sheinbaum reportedly said.\n\nWhile Mexico is delaying its response for a few days, Canada and China retaliated with their own immediate tariffs. China also put new export and investment restrictions on 25 American firms.\n\nTrump sees tariffs as a useful tool for pursuing key parts of his agenda. He wants to pressure America's immediate neighbors Canada and Mexico to do more to tighten their borders and stop the trafficking of illicit drugs and undocumented migrants.\n\nThe American president is also using tariffs to force better trade terms with other countries or, if they are not willing to improve access for American firms, protect domestic companies from global competition instead.\n\nMexico and Canada are the two largest trading partners of the U.S. Census Bureau data shows U.S. trade volume in goods with Mexico and Canada was worth $1.57 trillion combined in 2023.\n\nSheinbaum emphasized that these measures were not intended to \"initiate an economic or commercial confrontation,\" which \"is the opposite of what we should be doing,\" and urged greater economic integration in their region to stay competitive globally.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said, per newspaper Milenio: \"We will always seek a negotiated solution, as we have proposed within the framework of respect for our sovereignty, but the unilateral decision made by the United States affects national and foreign companies operating in our country and affects our peoples. That is why we have decided to respond with tariff and non-tariff measures that I will announce in the public square next Sunday.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said in remarks at the White House: \"I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they're going to build car plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here, because we have the market. We're the market where they sell the most.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement: \"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship.\"\n\nJason DeVito, Senior Portfolio Manager for Emerging Market Debt at Federated Hermes, said: \"We don't believe aggressive tariffs on Mexico will remain in place for long given the substantial inflationary impact it would have on U.S. economy. However, we do expect some form of tariffs to be levied, but not 25 percent persisting.\n\n\"Twenty-five percent tariffs, if persistent would almost invariably shock the Mexican economy into recession, in my view. External buffers in Mexico are strong and debt-to-GDP ratio is moderate. We expect limited default risk, but the next 12 months may be an economic malaise.\"\n\nSheinbaum will reveal the nature of Mexico's tariff and non-tariff measures against the U.S. on Sunday.\n\nThe economic impacts of the burgeoning trade war will be seen in data such as GDP, employment, and inflation figures over the coming months.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nShane Croucher is a Breaking News Editor based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris strode along the United States' southern border in Douglas, Arizona recently, she sought to draw voters' attention to a tougher Democratic stance on immigration policy.\n\nShe claimed former President Donald Trump \"did nothing to fix our broken immigration system\" as president, and that Republicans offered a \"false choice\" between border security and a \"safe, orderly, and humane\" immigration system. \"We can and must do both,\" she said.\n\nBut Harris' campaign event and photo op was only possible because the Chihuahuan desert backdrop behind her was as quiet as it has been in years.\n\nAfter reaching a record high in December 2023, the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol encounters with migrants crossing the southern frontier has dropped by 77 percent overall -a stunningly sharp decline in a 9 month-period.\n\nSince June executive orders limited the extent to which U.S. border officers will consider asylum claims-a likely violation of international and U.S. humanitarian law-the Biden Administration and Harris have been quick to take credit .\n\nBut the difference since last December is not only that prospective entrants are being turned away by U.S. law enforcement; it's that these would-be asylum seekers are barely even approaching the border in the first place because Mexican officials are proactively intercepting them en route and transporting them to the southernmost reaches of the country.\n\nMexican authorities have reportedly been intercepting roughly 8,000 U.S.-bound migrants per day thanks to a mix of military patrols and highway checkpoints as part of a program Mexico launched at the request of American officials last year.\n\nIts effect on the November election cannot be overstated.\n\nTrump reportedly believes that voters' dissatisfaction with border control will power his re-election on Nov. 5.\n\nAnd when she became the Democratic Party 's nominee in August, Harris' greatest political liability was her time as the unofficial \"border czar\" in the White House. Though she was never so ordained, President Joe Biden assigned Harris to lead an initiative addressing the root causes of irregular migration in 2021-an impossible file that became an albatross for her political ambitions.\n\nIn significantly alleviating what was a crisis mere months ago, the Mexicans have allowed Harris to neutralize her primary policy weakness and change the subject.\n\nMore than any Iranian email hack or Russian trolls on social media, this is the most significant form of \"foreign influence\" on the 2024 election to date. And it's not a secret.\n\nTo be clear, the Mexican government has not ignored the U.S. border until now. They too are invested in order at their biggest trading partner's 2,000-mile border, where hundreds of thousands of people cross each day to work, visit family, and attend school.\n\nFormer Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador imposed visa restrictions on people from migrant-sending countries this year, he spent $1.5 billion to improve \"smart\" border technology two years ago, and the U.S. and Mexico have long worked together to combat drug trafficking and transnational crime.\n\nBut Mexico's more aggressive patrols and interceptions, combined with the Biden administration's revised asylum rules, have produced the greatest effect.\n\nIn his first term, former President Donald Trump destabilized US-Mexico cooperation, and diplomatic observers know that the Mexican government is wary of another four years of tension and \"America First\" unilateralism.\n\nHowever, the takeaway here is not Mexico's pro-Harris bias; it is that the only real way to make international migration more orderly is for sovereign nations to work together.\n\nIndeed, if Donald Trump were serious about bringing greater order to the U.S. southern border, he would have engaged his counterparts to the south to produce the same results. Instead, Trump vilified Mexicans and pulled out of the United Nations ' 2018 Global Compact for Migration-a non-binding agreement in which 152 countries, including Mexico, agreed to broaden multilateral governance of people crossing borders. So, it's not surprising that, after Trump's four years in power, the challenges of border control persisted.\n\nAlthough the Global Compact was no panacea, it at least was intended to facilitate more multinational cooperation to resolve a collective action problem in the face of escalating push factors like climate change, violence, and poverty in low-income countries.\n\nIn the absence of a broader regional partnership, today's U.S.-Mexico partnership struggles to strike the balance between controlling flows and protecting migrants' human rights.\n\nThe new American asylum rules, which the White House tightened this month , block asylum access when border enforcement encounters spike. This prevents people who claim to be fleeing persecution and humanitarian crises from receiving due process . Of equal concern, last week, Mexican soldiers opened fire on a truck carrying a group of international migrants near the border with Guatemala, leaving six migrants dead and 12 injured.\n\nIf more countries like Canada or Chile were to collaborate with the U.S. and Mexico in the future, they could pursue a burden-sharing arrangement that would not require such violations to relieve the border bottleneck. The Biden administration is actually beginning to assemble such a regional architecture of multilateral governance. And this month, Brazil imposed entry restrictions on some Asian nationals to prevent migration to the U.S.\n\nBut if countries try to govern migration alone, the Chihuahuan Desert will only get busier.\n\nJustin Gest ( @_JustinGest ) is a Newsweek columnist.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation project in American history, using the military and local law enforcement to do it, in a move that could echo the last major effort to remove migrants en masse in the 1950s.\n\nDubbed \"Operation Wetback\", hundreds of thousands of mostly Mexican undocumented immigrants were forcibly removed or self-deported during President Dwight D. Eisenhower's term.\n\nThe program's name was derogatory even at the time, referring to migrants who crossed illegally into the United States by crossing rivers along the southwest border. Historians say racial profiling and large-scale roundups were common, and some U.S. citizens were caught up in the sweeps.\n\n\"It's often referenced as this moment when aggressive immigration law enforcement 'solved' the immigration problem or crisis. The problem is that understanding is not correct,\" Professor Kelly Lytle Hernandez, who teaches immigration and mass incarceration at UCLA, told Newsweek .\n\nOperation Wetback's roots can be traced to a project in the 1940s, known as the Bracero Program, that brought Mexican farm workers into the U.S. legally to help fill labor shortages brought on during WWII . Bracero was managed by agencies from both governments, with a requirement for minimum wages and humane treatment including shelter, food and sanitation.\n\nTexan farmers excluded themselves for the first five years, viewing the agreement as too restrictive, and brought in their own direct hires from Mexico instead, illegally.\n\nAn estimated 300,000 migrants were brought in through the Bracero program each year, and while many complied with the temporary status offered, many others did not and remained in the U.S. without documentation.\n\nThat spurred President Eisenhower to authorize Operation Wetback, with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) - the precursor to ICE - sending its officers out in July 1954 to find unauthorized migrants and deport them. On the first day alone, over 4,800 people were apprehended.\n\n\"The border patrol actually did not apprehend all that many people. They lied and they twister their numbers to make it seem as though they had deported a million people,\" Hernandez said. \"They had targeted Mexicans in particular, it was a highly-racialized campaign.\"\n\nThe professor explained that INS didn't just target farm workers. Officers also raided kitchens and restaurants in urban areas, while detention camps were set up in cities like Los Angeles for those awaiting deportation .\n\nThose who were arrested by the border patrol were sent back across the border, often deep into Mexico to discourage reentry, in collaboration with the Mexican government.\n\nAround 700 officers were tasked with fanning out across Texas and then further afield to reach illegal immigrants, but the government messaging and media coverage made the operation sound much bigger, pushing some to \"self-deport\" out of fear.\n\nThe numbers put out by INS, which showed a spike in arrests and then a drop off, did not herald the success many claimed the operation to be. Hernandez explained that at the end of summer 1954, immigration forces were simply demobilized.\n\n\"They just stopped arresting people, they couldn't apprehend as many people when they didn't have the trucks and the planes and the boats they were using to deport people,\" she said, adding that how the operation played out should serve as a warning to the Trump administration as it games out its own mass deportation strategy.\n\n\"We're being sold a story that mass arrests are what's going to resolve our immigration issues, when in fact it's comprehensive immigration reforms.\"\n\nHernandez noted how the U.S. has changed how it polices its borders since Eisenhower's term, both externally through newer technology and diplomatically with agreements with other countries. Under the next Trump administration, Hernandez expects to see echoes of Operation Wetback play out in a modern context.\n\n\"I would expect to see roadblocks and a stop-and-frisk operation around immigration control, especially in the 100-mile zone\" near the southern border, she said.\n\n\"I expect racial profiling to be rampant. Back in '54 it targeted Mexican immigrants, at this point I think it's pretty clear that Black and Muslim migrants, in addition to Latinx migrants will be targeted.\"\n\nMexico has been getting tougher on tackling immigration, both when it comes to those wanting to stay in the country and who are passing through to get to the U.S. The Biden administration has also struck agreements with Panama to manage the flow of people through the Darien Gap.\n\nThe President-elect has said tackling the flow of illegal immigration will be a day one priority, meaning he will likely sign executive orders to push through actions on the border, including mass deportations and the revocation of legal pathways used by the Biden administration, such as Temporary Protected Status and Humanitarian Parole, known as CHNV.\n\nBoth allowed migrants from select countries to enter the U.S. or remain in the country without fear of deportation, while allowing them a period of time to work while more formal visas were processed.\n\nWhile it remains unknown as to who may be targeted first, CHNV has allowed upwards of 530,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter the U.S., while 863,000 people from around 16 countries were covered by TPS.\n\nAll of those are present legally , but if the programs are ended by the next administration, then those migrants could be included in initial deportations as part of what Trump branded \"Operation Aurora\", after the Colorado city which has seen issues with Venezuelan gang members.\n\n\"I would expect to see a lot of publicity stunts and lies about what they're actually accomplishing,\" Hernandez said.\n\nFormer acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) chief, Tom Homan, who will be Trump's new Border czar , has promised to first target those who present a threat to national security and those in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"If you're in the country illegally, you shouldn't feel comfortable, absolutely not. I wouldn't feel comfortable if I were in another country illegally; you shouldn't be comfortable either,\" Homan told Fox News on Monday. \"When you enter this country illegally, you have committed a crime.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMexicans from different regions of the country are as genetically different as Europeans are from Asians, researchers have found.\n\nThe vast differences in the patchwork of Native American ancestry indicate that Mexicans should no longer be lumped into one homogeneous group, particularly when it comes to clinical practice, according to a report published Thursday in Science . The study was led by a group of scientists from Stanford University's School of Medicine, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and the Mexican National Institute of Genomic Medicine.\n\n\"When you walk into a clinic, whether you know it or not, someone makes a decision about you. Are you white, are you European, are you African, are you Asian?\" says Esteban Burchard, professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences and medicine at UCSF. \"In the U.S., one of the things we ask is, are you Hispanic?\"\n\nNow, says, Burchard, it has become clear that what is normal for one ethnic group may be borderline abnormal for another-and taking the finer details of Latino health into consideration can make the difference between an accurate diagnosis and an erroneous one.\n\nResearchers studied lung function, in particular, and concluded that diseases such as asthma and emphysema are determined by a person's type of Native American ancestry. For example, a person in northwest Mexico would have lungs that appear approximately 12 years younger than a person of the same age and height in the country's southeast region.\n\nScientists also found that people of mixed European and Native American heritage-two groups that began exchanging genes some 500 years ago during the Spanish colonization-were found to have genomes corresponding to their local indigenous population. A person in the northern state of Sonora, for example, is more likely to have Seri or Tarahumara genomic components while someone from Yucatan, in the country's southeast, would probably display a Mayan gene component. These, in turn, are as genetically different as the Europeans are from the Chinese.\n\nThese results can be used to spot larger trends. \"This is not just relevant to Mexico. It's relevant, number one, to all of Latin America, so a fifth of the world population. The method, the observations, are generalizable to the entire world,\" said Burchard.\n\n\"We're showing, for the first time on a country-wide level, genetic variation in Native American population,\" added Burchard.\n\nSince most genetic studies to date have concentrated on Europeans or European Americans, researchers said, the team decided to focus this study on Native American ancestry. It was a way to both celebrate and understand a marginalized and understudied segment of the global population, says Carlos Bustamante, professor of genetics at Stanford and one of the lead authors of the study.\n\nMexico was a natural choice not only because it has one of the largest amounts of pre-Columbian genetic diversity in the Americas but also because some scientists in the team had already been collecting samples from the area for years. In the end, researchers utilized 1,000 samples, about half of which belonged to Native Americans and half to mestizos, or people with mixed descent. Together, scientists had nearly 1 million genetic variants to work with.\n\nThe study, its authors say, highlights the need to study populations worldwide so that the fruits of the Human Genome Project become accessible to all.\n\n\"Our hope is that we can move the needle and develop genomic medicine so that it benefits everyone, not just the populations of European descent,\" says Bustamante.\n\nThe findings, Burchard says, will also help advance precision medicine, a practice in which a person's genetic information is used to tailor a specific medical treatment.\n\nBustamante said his team plans on using the samples to study signatures of natural selection in different environments, as well as biomedical traits such as height.\n\nAbout 40 experts, including researchers from Puerto Rico, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, participated in the study, which was financed by the Mexican government, the UCSF Chancellor's Research Fellowship, the American Asthma Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, among others.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Thousands more are expected to arrive in the coming weeks, and their total number could reach as high as 10,000.\n\nThe travelers have been on the road for more than a month and now face a long wait to have their asylum claims processed. Mexican and U.S. authorities have strengthened security at border crossing points as more and more migrants arrive.\n\nOn Sunday, protesters gathered at a statue of Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc, around a mile from the U.S. border. Waving Mexican flags and singing the national anthem, the demonstrators chanted, \"Out! Out!\" and suggested the Central American migrants \"are invaders! They are armed! Get out of the country,\" Reuters reported.\n\nEsther Monroy, 58, told Agence France-Presse she was worried that the arrival of the migrants would lead the U.S. to close the border crossing entirely. \"Most of us in this depend on business from people coming and going across the border,\" she explained. \"If they close it, it will be [the migrants'] fault.\"\n\nCounterprotesters stood nearby in support of the new arrivals, calling on the government to do more to assist the vulnerable migrants waiting for their turn to apply for asylum north or the border.

The mayor warned that migrants would have to wait up to six months to be processed by U.S. authorities-a strain that might prove too much for his city of 1.6 million people.\n\nOn Saturday, Mexico's Interior Ministry said the government was sending extra food and blankets to help migrants in Tijuana. The local government has converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. This move has more than quadrupled the city's shelter capacity-from 700 in privately run facilities to up to 3,000 at the gymnasium.\n\nPresident Donald Trump frequently mentioned the caravan in the run-up to the midterms, banking on immigration as an issue that could energize his base.\n\nDespite Trump's aggressive rhetoric, which critics condemned as \"racist ,\" and his deployment of around 7,000 American troops to the border-branded a PR stunt by opponents-the Republicans suffered a heavy defeat at the polls. Though the party managed to cling on to its Senate majority, the Democrats took back the House by a comfortable margin.\n\nThe president was quick to pick up on Gastelum's warnings. On Sunday, he tweeted : \"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months,'\" he tweeted. \"Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico.

      "text": "8 facts about recent Latino immigrants to the U.S.\n\nNumbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World\n\nRead our research on:\n\nFull Topic List\n\nRead Our Research On:\n\n|\n\nNearly 20 million Latino immigrants lived in the United States in 2021 , accounting for almost a third (31.8%) of the nation's total Latino population that year.\n\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to explore the demographic characteristics of recent Latino immigrants to the United States, both overall and by individual origin group. Recent immigrants are defined as those who have resided in the U.S. for five years or less at the time of the survey.\n\nThe analysis uses microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 decennial census and 2010 and 2021 American Community Surveys, accessed through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) from the University of Minnesota. Findings in this analysis are only shown for origin groups with an unweighted sample size of more than 200.\n\nThe terms Hispanic and Latino are used interchangeably in this analysis, as are the terms foreign born and immigrant . Foreign born refers to individuals born outside the U.S. who are not U.S. citizens at birth.\n\nIn this analysis, Hispanic origin is not the same as birthplace. Origin is determined by Hispanic self-identity. For example, a respondent who identifies as being of Mexican origin may have been born in a country other than Mexico. Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin are included in the analysis of all Hispanics living in the U.S., but not the analyses of Hispanic immigrants living in the U.S. Those born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens at birth.\n\nAll displayed numbers are rounded. Shares and percent changes are calculated using unrounded numbers.\n\nAbout 2.6 million of these immigrants arrived in the U.S. in the five years prior to the 2021 American Community Survey - the primary data source for this analysis - but before a recent spike in asylum-seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border .\n\nHere are eight facts about these recently arrived Latino immigrants in the U.S.\n\nThe number of recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. has declined. In 2000, there were 3.8 million foreign-born Hispanics who had been in the U.S. for five years or less. This number fell to 3 million in 2010 and 2.6 million in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Hispanic immigrants who have been in the U.S. for more than five years has grown, from 10.4 million in 2000 to 15.9 million in 2010 and to 17.3 million in 2021.\n\nMexican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Dominican and Venezuelan immigrants make up a large share of the recent Hispanic immigrant population in the U.S.\n\nIn 2021, Mexicans made up 34% of the recent Hispanic immigrant population and were the largest group. They are also the largest group among all Hispanic immigrants (54%) and all U.S. immigrants (24%). Even so, the foreign-born Mexican population in the U.S. declined 8.8% since 2010, including a decline in the number of recently arrived Mexicans.\n\nAnother 36% of recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are Guatemalan, Honduran, Dominican or Venezuelan. Each of these four groups saw an increase in recent arrivals from 2010 to 2021. For example, the number of Venezuelan immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for five years or less increased from 40,000 in 2010 to 215,000 in 2021.\n\nThe median age for recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. is 27.9 years, though the median varies widely among origin groups. Cubans and Venezuelans have the highest median ages at 36.3 and 36.0 years. The next oldest group is Peruvians at 35.3 years.\n\nHondurans and Guatemalans are the youngest groups among recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S., with median ages of 22.4 and 21.9 years, respectively.\n\nAmong recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S., Venezuelans are the most likely to have a bachelor's degree. Overall, 27% of recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. ages 25 and older have earned at least a bachelor's degree in the U.S. or elsewhere - up from 11% in 2000.\n\nAround six-in-ten recent Venezuelan immigrants ages 25 and older (62%) have completed at least a bachelor's degree. The same is true for 43% of recent Hispanic immigrants who are Colombian and 42% of those who are Peruvian.\n\nIn contrast, 88% of recent Guatemalan arrivals have no college experience, the highest share among recent Hispanic immigrants. They are followed by recent immigrants from Honduras (76%) and El Salvador (71%).\n\nWomen represent a growing share of recent Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. and are a majority in some origin groups. In 2021, women made up 47.8% of all recent Hispanic immigrants, up from 43.6% in 2000.\n\nMore than half of recent Peruvian (55.8%) and Colombian (55.7%) immigrants to the U.S. are women, the highest shares among recent Hispanic immigrants.\n\nBy contrast, 59.8% of recent Guatemalan immigrants are men, the highest share of any origin group. Men also account for more than half of recent Mexican immigrants (55.7%).\n\nFour-in-ten recent Latino immigrant adults have never been married. Recent Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran immigrant adults are the most likely never to have been married. This is the case for about half or more of recent immigrants from these countries. Notably, these are also the groups with the lowest median ages.\n\nAmong recent Mexican immigrants - the largest group in 2021 - a majority (54%) are married, while 38% have never been married.\n\nRecent arrivals represent more than 25% of all Hispanic immigrants in some states. This is especially the case in Louisiana, where 30.9% of all Hispanic immigrants have arrived within the last five years as of 2021.\n\nStill, these states have relatively small Hispanic immigrant populations overall. The largest Latino immigrant populations are in California, Texas and Florida. In these states, recent arrivals account for a comparably small share of all Hispanic immigrants.\n\nAbout a quarter of recent Latino immigrants to the U.S. are proficient in English, but there are notable differences by origin group. About a third of recent Venezuelan (34%), Peruvian (32%) and Colombian immigrants (31%) ages 5 and older are proficient in English.\n\nBy comparison, recent Guatemalan, Nicaraguan and Honduran immigrants are the least likely to be proficient in English. Fewer than 20% in each group report speaking English at home or speaking it \"very well.\"\n\nOverall, recent Hispanic immigrants in 2021 were slightly more proficient in English than those in 2000 (26% vs. 21%).\n\nHispanic immigrants who have been in the U.S. longer than five years are more proficient in English. This is the case for 37% of Hispanic immigrants who have been in the U.S. for five to 10 years and 39% of Hispanic immigrants who have been in the U.S. for 11 or more years.\n\nTopics\n\nJoanne Haner is a former intern at Pew Research Center .\n\nMark Hugo Lopez is director of race and ethnicity research at Pew Research Center .\n\n901 E St. NW, Suite 300 Washington, DC 20004 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

      "text": "Trump's Tariffs Will Make Americans, Mexicans, and Canadians Poorer\n\nFree Trade\n\nJack Nicastro | 1.23.2025 11:16 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump has floated 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, set to take effect on February 1. If implemented, these tariffs wouldn't just hurt the Canadian and Mexican economies, but also make American consumers poorer and domestic manufacturers less competitive.\n\nFrom January 2024 through September 2024, total trade between the U.S. and Mexico surpassed $700 billion , while trade with the U.S. and Canada came just short of that figure. Canada and Mexico are also America's two largest export markets: $325 billion and $275 billion worth of goods and services were sold to Canada and Mexico, respectively, over the first three quarters of 2024.\n\nU.S.-levied tariffs would hurt all countries involved. Research conducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicts that 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico would decrease American gross domestic product (GDP) by $200 billion, Canadian GDP by $100 billion, and Mexican GDP growth by 2 percent. These tariffs would also diminish American manufacturing.\n\nTD Economics finds that \"most Canadian exports are inputs used by American businesses in their own production.\" Similarly, Mexico's third-largest export to the U.S. is intermediate goods for vehicles, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity , a data visualization tool for international trade. Erecting tariffs on Canada and Mexico would not only increase the cost of goods enjoyed by American consumers but also increase the price of Canadian and Mexican inputs for American manufacturers, reducing the competitiveness of our exports internationally.\n\nTrump's proposed tariffs have triggered responses from Mexican and Canadian officials. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised that his country would \"respond to unfair tariffs in a number of ways.\" He has also cautioned the president, saying \"Canada provides many of the necessary inputs the American economy is going to need in order to grow and boom,\" such as $170 billion worth of oil, natural gas, and power. Ontario Premier Doug Ford went further, directing the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to prohibit the sale of all American alcohol in the event that Trump follows through with his tariffs on February 1.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided threatening the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs. However, Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico's chief negotiator in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement , warned that the American economy \"relies on hundreds of billions of dollars in Mexican imports that boost the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector.\"\n\nTrump would be well advised to heed warnings from America's neighbors and pursue a policy of bilateral free trade with them instead of a policy of mutual antagonism. Tariffs make American consumers poorer and American industry less competitive; there's no reason to adopt such an economically indefensible policy.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Are Hispanics Following the Path of the Irish?\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nHispanic\n\nIlya Somin | 1.1.2024 4:06 PM\n\nHispanics are by far the largest American immigrant group of the last several decades, and also the focus of the most extensive nativist concerns. Immigration restrictionists contend that Hispanic immigrants increase crime, undermine American political institutions, and cannot or will not assimilate. In a recent post , prominent economic policy commentator Noah Smith compiles evidence that these complaints are largely misplaced, and that Hispanics are in fact following a trajectory similar to that of Irish-Americans in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries:\n\n[T]he best historical analogy for Hispanic immigration to the U.S. is the great Irish immigration of the 1800s. The usual analogy we draw is to the Italians, but I think the Irish make a better model. First of all, Irish immigration, like immigration from Mexico and Central America - but unlike immigration from Italy - was very drawn-out over a long period of time....\n\nLike Hispanics, Irish migrants were mostly working-class folks who came for mainly economic reasons - pressures from poverty back in Ireland, plus the great dream of making it in America. And like Hispanics, they provoked a sustained and ferocious pushback from nativists....\n\nThe cartoon at the top of this post is from 1871 [note: I have reproduced the same cartoon at the start of this post], and features a huge number of negative stereotypes - the Irish as terrorists, as drunkards, as criminals, as seeking to dominate American culture....\n\nYou can see these anxieties paralleled in modern conservative worries about Hispanic immigration. Conservatives worry that terrorists are coming up through the southern border, that traditional American culture will be destroyed by immigrant culture, or even that the U.S. will have a civil war along racial lines.\n\nEconomic concerns are also very similar.... Worries that poor Irish immigrants would swamp local welfare systems - similar to worries about Hispanics overloading the welfare state in the 1990s and beyond - resulted in a large number of restrictive anti-immigration measures at the state level.....\n\nToday's fears of supposedly violent and unassimilable Hispanics are remarkably similar to the nineteenth century stereotype of brutish, un-American Irishmen.\n\nIn the rest of the article, Smith compiles evidence that the concerns about Hispanics are largely false: they are in fact rapidly assimilating, quickly increasing their wealth and income, and have significantly lower crime rates than native-born Americans (a point that applies even to undocumented immigrants ). Most of this evidence is well-known to students of immigration policy. But Smith does a valuable service in compiling it in one relatively short and easily accessible piece.\n\nI have previously written about how once-widespread hostility towards Irish-Americans gradually faded away to the point where the difference between the Irish and other white Americans no longer has much political or social significance. For example, most Americans barely even notice that Joe Biden is only the second Irish Catholic president, and hardly anyone worries that he's trying to advance Irish interests at the expense of WASPs, or that he's following the dictates of the Vatican. As Smith explains, the distinction between whites and Hispanics may well be gradually moving in the same direction.\n\nI would, however, note a few relevant caveats to Smith's thesis. First, it is not entirely true that Irish and Hispanic immigrants \"were mostly working-class folks who came for mainly economic reasons.\" In reality, many Hispanic immigrants were and are refugees from oppressive socialist regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and (most recently) Venezuela. Some others have fled repression at the hands of right-wing dictatorships. For their part, the many Irish migrants were fleeing not just poverty, but also repression at the hands of the British. This experience with repression in their countries of origin likely strengthens the migrants' attachment to American institutions, which, despite various flaws, offer them greater freedom and tolerance than those they fled.\n\nA second caveat is that Hispanic migrants are a much more diverse lot than the Irish were. They come from a variety of different nations and ethnic groups. This makes generalizations about them more difficult. Cubans, Mexicans, Salvadorans, Brazilians, and others all have somewhat different backgrounds and experiences, though there are some commonalities, as well. Indeed, as my George Mason University colleague David Bernstein shows in a recent book , \"Hispanic\" is actually a largely artificial category created not by the migrants themselves, but by US government bureaucrats.\n\nFinally, while Irish immigrants arrived in an era when there were few restrictions on European immigration, many Hispanic migrants are undocumented. Today, there are an estimated 7 million or more undocumented Hispanic immigrants in the US, which accounts for some one-third of all foreign-born Hispanics, and over 70% of the total undocumented immigrant population.\n\nFor obvious reasons, lack of legal status reduces migrants' incomes and educational opportunities, and impedes assimilation . The existence of this anchor makes Hispanics' progress look even more impressive than it would be otherwise. But, unless immigration policy changes, it is likely to continue to slow down the assimilation process highlighted by Smith.\n\nThe obvious solution to this problem is simply to grant legal status to the undocumented, or at least the vast majority of them. Previous amnesties have increased income and assimilation, and a new one would likely have similar effects (thereby also boosting the US economy in the process). But that may not be politically feasible for some time to come.\n\nUPDATE: In my post, I list Brazilians as one of the \"Hispanic\" groups. But the federal government does not classify them as such, because the official definition of Hispanic is limited to people of \"Spanish culture or origin.\" However, many Brazilians do describe themselves as \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" in surveys , and they are often colloquially described as \"Hispanic\" by others. Ultimately, little in my analysis turns on whether Brazilians are properly considered \"Hispanic\" or not. Even if we exclude them, the Hispanic category is still remarkably diverse, including people with origins in a variety of different countries.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The U.S. Is Trying To Keep Out Mexicans Who Want To Sell Their Blood Plasma\n\nBlood Donors\n\nFiona Harrigan | 7.27.2021 11:40 AM\n\nAmong other supply chain issues sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, the world now faces a shortage of blood plasma, which is used in life-saving therapies for people who have certain chronic illnesses. A new policy implemented by the Biden administration serves to make that shortage worse.\n\nOn June 15, Customs and Border Protection announced that Mexicans would no longer be permitted to enter the U.S. on temporary visitor visas to sell their plasma. The new policy now designates Mexican donors \"labor for hire,\" which makes it illegal for them to sell plasma while holding a B1/B2 visitor visa, as the majority of those donors have previously done.\n\nThe Immune Deficiency Foundation estimates that the restrictions on Mexican donors could reduce the U.S. plasma supply by 5-10 percent. Though that may not sound drastic, Georgetown University ethics professor and paid plasma expert Peter Jaworski calls it an \"enormous\" issue. Jaworski tells Reason that the pandemic had already reduced U.S.-based plasma collection by 20-25 percent. \"We are in a medicinal crunch,\" he says. \"We don't have enough of these medicines. Already there's a shortage in Spain...and in other parts of the European Union as well. Unless we figure out a way to increase plasma collection, we're not going to overcome those shortages.\"\n\nDemand for plasma is rising, too- growing annually between 6-8 percent .* Plasma-for-pay is key to solving this issue, but few nations are willing to acknowledge that reality.\n\nJust five countries allow donors to receive payment for blood plasma-the United States, Germany, Hungary, Austria, and the Czech Republic. That compensation model has led to these five nations having plasma collection surpluses , while countries that have to import plasma constantly grapple with shortages. Countries that allow paid plasma comprise 89 percent of the world's plasma supply. The U.S. provides over 70 percent, making Biden's move a potential catastrophe for the global importers of American plasma. In Spain, for example, La Razon reported that therapy providers have already had to space out plasma treatments due to shortages.\n\nThere are no alternatives to plasma-based medicines for the patients who use them. According to Jaworski, \"they either get immunoglobulin or they suffer and sometimes die.\" Roughly 300,000 Europeans and 125,000 Americans rely on plasma therapies to treat chronic illnesses- like Von Willebrand disease and hemophilia -and many more are treated with plasma after traumatic accidents or in preparation for surgeries. Researchers have looked to plasma in their efforts to treat COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease , making a reliable global supply all the more important.\n\nStill, critics of paid blood plasma say the practice is exploitative. (A June ProPublica article celebrated Biden's June policy change with the headline, \" The U.S. Is Closing a Loophole That Lured Mexicans Over the Border to Donate Blood Plasma for Cash .\") They claim that plasma centers put Mexican donors at medical risk with the promise of making a quick buck. Beyond the blatant disregard for donor agency, that argument neglects how financially important paid plasma donation can be for people south of the border.\n\nThe U.S. caps donations at 104 per year, and with donors paid up to $40 for every donation, a Mexican donor could feasibly make over $4,000 annually from selling plasma. \"The average salary in at least some of these border cities in Mexico is estimated to be about $9 a day,\" explains Jaworski. \"Meanwhile, Mexicans could cross the border and get basically $80 a week donating plasma twice a week.\" Knowing that, Mexican donors have decided that selling plasma is a valuable opportunity to make some cash.\n\n\"Take anything that you think is exploitative. You need to look at what the second-best option for that group of people is,\" says Jaworski. \"In banning the ability of Mexicans to cross the border to sell their plasma, we don't thereby put money in their pockets. So whatever it is that made them exploitable in the first place still exists.\"\n\n\"A lot of us were already unemployed and trying to make ends meet,\" Geraldo Rivera, a regular plasma donor from Mexico, told Texas Public Radio shortly after the policy change. \"Now they say we can't donate and we don't know how we're going to survive.\"\n\n\"Whether I have a steady job or not, I'm going to go back to donating,\" Saul Vazquez, another frequent donor, told the El Paso Times .\n\nCharges of high medical risk may well be overblown, too. The ProPublica article cautions that \"frequent donors were underweight and showed low levels of antibodies,\" but Jaworski says this is \"basically speculation.\" Paid plasma centers test potential donors' protein and hemoglobin levels to ensure collection will go smoothly.\n\nFar from being an exploitative practice, paid blood plasma donation is a lifeline for many Mexicans, and absolutely essential for patients with autoimmune disorders and other immunodeficiencies who rely on these therapies. And yet, the Biden administration has decided to jeopardize the world's plasma supply, patient well-being, and the financial livelihoods of Mexican donors all at once.\n\n*Correction: A previous version of this article referred to plasma demand tripling during the pandemic. That tripling is mostly due to rising demand for unpaid transfusable plasma, not the paid plasma used in therapies covered by this piece.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

That's a trend stretching back a decade or so.\n\nThe annual inbound migration from Mexico is about one-fifth or one-sixth of what it was about a decade ago, when it was about 500,000 each year, said Jeff Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew center. Demographers said outbound migration to Mexico has remained stable at about 150,000 annually.\n\nPassel credits three main drivers of change:\n\n• The Great Recession caused job losses across the board, including in construction and other industries that employed many undocumented immigrants. The economy has remained soft since.\n\n• Increased U.S. border enforcement and associated factors including the dangers of crossing the border and the cost of hiring a smuggler, which can run as high as $3,000 per person.\n\n• Shifts in Mexico that include demographic changes such as lower birthrates and social improvements such as greater educational attainment.\n\nDemographers also credit economic development in Mexico for boosting employment rates.\n\nAye caramba! How can it be? Aren't we still being told by Dems and Reps alike (though more often by Reps for sure) that we've lost control of our southern border and that it's easier to walk across a couple of hundred miles of desert to freedom (i.e., working on a construction site or in a field somewhere) than it is even to score some bath salts at the local mall's Crabtree & Evelyn? Read more.\n\nAnd yet, yet, yet, aren't the brave, the few, the mestizo that still make the trek creating a crime wave the likes we haven't seen since the Mustache Petes from southern Italy (hi, Grandpa Guida!) started stinking up the country with their olive oil and garlic-based cuisine and their romantical crooning and refused to assimilate? Put more plainly: Isn't crime caused by illegal immigration or even legal immigration a plague among the U.S. border with Mexico? Not on the American side, senor. Take it away, USA Today, who looked at the issue with the help of actual statistics and produced this:\n\nThe analysis found that rates of violent crime along the U.S.-Mexico border have been falling for years - even before the U.S. security buildup that has included thousands of law enforcement officers and expansion of a massive fence along the border.\n\nU.S. border cities were statistically safer on average than other cities in their states. Those border cities, big and small, have maintained lower crime rates than the national average, which itself has been falling.\n\nThe appearance of an out-of-control border region, though, has had wide-ranging effects - stalling efforts to pass a national immigration reform law, fueling stringent anti-immigration laws in Arizona and elsewhere, and increasing the amount of federal tax dollars going to build more fencing and add security personnel along the southwestern border.\n\nThe perception of rising violence is so engrained that 83% of Americans said they believe the rate of violence along the southwestern border is higher than national rates, according to a recent USA TODAY/Gallup Poll of 999 adults.\n\nMore here .\n\nRead that weep. For joy. And then outrage that folks desperate to come to our country for a better way of life for them and their children - f olks who as a group pay payroll and even income taxes at astonishingly high rates for \"undocumented\" workers, who are less likely to engage in crime or use welfare than native-born Americans - are still being vilified in the hearts and minds of our countrymen.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Mexico Embraces You\n\nReason Roundup\n\nLiz Wolfe | 1.23.2025 9:30 AM\n\nMexico's preparations for a border shutdown: Following President Donald Trump's campaign trail announcement that he would launch the largest deportation effort in American history, the Mexican government under President Claudia Sheinbaum started readying itself to serve as an oppositional force to Trump. The program that resulted-\"Mexico Embraces You\"-aims to shelter deported Mexicans, some 5 million of whom are estimated to be living in the United States illegally and thus at risk of being sent back.\n\nWith the shutdown of the CBP One app, which helped asylum seekers schedule appointments with American immigration officials, and the mass canceling of appointments, many migrants have become mired in what must feel like purgatory; a sense that their future plans are indefinitely put on hold, contingent on the whims of the Trump administration. But for those already in the country without papers, rumors have also begun to circulate that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) roundups will begin. Accordingly, Mexico has started constructing giant tent shelters in nine border towns across the country's north, which will \"provide deported Mexicans with food, temporary housing, medical care, and assistance in obtaining identity documents\" (per Reuters), as well as the opportunity to board buses to be sent back to their hometowns, free of charge. The program also seeks to provide citizens with cash cards worth about $100 each.\n\nΔ\n\nA little under 4 percent of Mexico's population is living undocumented in the U.S.; if sent back, this could present major problems for the Mexican government. \"Basically, with the cancellation of CBP One and deportations, the government isn't coordinated to receive them,\" Jose Luis Perez, the director of migration issues for Tijuana, told reporters (before being fired from his position seemingly for casting doubt).\n\n\"Sheinbaum has signaled that Mexico could receive deportees other than Mexicans,\" per The New York Times. \"She said, however, that her government planned to 'voluntarily' return any non-Mexican nationals-including those waiting for asylum hearings in the United States-to their countries of origin.\" But it's far from clear what that looks like (\"voluntary\"?) or how the logistics work or who pays for that.\n\nThe raids that haven't happened: So far, the promised ICE raids have not commenced. \"After weeks of preparation by Chicago's immigrant communities-and a weekend of fear spurred by multiple reports that the city would be the site of the first major deportation raids of the new Trump administration-there were no reports of immigration enforcement on Tuesday,\" reports WBEZ Chicago. \"The Trump administration initially said it planned to deploy immigration enforcement agents in Chicago on Trump's first full day in office, saying they'd target immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records.\"\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was ending a policy that restricted Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents' ability to arrest undocumented people at or near so-called sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals,\" reports NBC News. Some former sanctuary cities, like Philadelphia , now have their public officials saying that they'll cooperate with federal authorities and the Trump administration.\n\n\"Sanctuary city can mean a lot of things, and so that whole discussion can get confusing and maybe generate more heat than light,\" said District Attorney Larry Krasner, calling Philly a \"city of brotherhood, of love, of sisterly affection, where we respect and support our immigrant neighbors who are hardworking and are law-abiding and are contributing to our society\" but also adding that he would \"follow the law.\"\n\n\"To the extent that ICE has the legal right to do things, obviously we will not interfere,\" Krasner added, departing from the standard sanctuary city line.\n\nOne thing that might be affecting Krasner's thinking: a just-issued Justice Department memo in which Trump promises to rain down consequences for state and local officials who resist federal immigration-related law enforcement efforts.\n\n\"Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don't want,\" Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, told Fox News yesterday. \"More agents in the communities, more people arrested, collateral arrests. If that's the game they want to play? Game on.\"\n\n\"Most Americans support both a meaningful number of deportations and meaningful limits to them,\" writes David Leonhardt in The New York Times. \"Trump and his aides will risk a public backlash if they wrongly believe that Americans will support almost any deportations. Many Americans will find it hard to accept the expulsion of undocumented immigrants who have lived here for many years and built stable lives.\" The Obama deportation strategy, notes Leonhardt, involved prioritizing those with criminal records ( contra Biden !) as well as those who had come here more recently, as opposed to those who are more established; if Trump were shrewd about ensuring public support, he might take a similar approach.\n\nScenes from New York: \"A Manhattan aesthetician was arrested and charged with injecting patients at his medical spa with counterfeit Botox, prosecutors said, sending some to the hospital,\" reports The New York Times. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said the aesthetician, who offered injections to reduce wrinkles in women and increase penis size in men \"knowingly purchased counterfeit Botox from China, injected it into his clients and represented that the counterfeit Botox that he was peddling was genuine.\" At least one patient developed botulism following injections. (This-as well as an enduring belief that Mrs. Robinson from The Graduate is the most beautiful woman to ever exist and that aging gracefully is the proper path-is why I don't get Botox!)\n\nSince Gavin Newsom has been talking to Hawaii Gov.

      "text": "Mexicans for Trump? \"It's a New Mundo.\"\n\nElection 2016\n\nNick Gillespie | 2.12.2016 3:38 PM\n\nCan Donald Trump, who kicked off his campaign for president last June by calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers, win over Latinos-especially Mexicans?\n\nSure, why not, writes Ruben Navarette, Jr. at The Daily Beast :\n\nThe relationship between U.S.-born Latinos and Latino immigrants, and even between foreign-born Latinos who have been naturalized and Latino immigrants, is complicated to say the least. There is an ambivalence there.\n\nAs a Mexican-American, I can tell you that many Mexican-Americans think that Mexican immigrants who come to the United States illegally are taking advantage-of a porous border, of the social-services safety net, of loopholes in immigration law, and of an insatiable appetite among U.S. employers for cheap and dependable labor. And they're not wrong about that.\n\nNavarette says you'll find Latinos, especially Mexicans, for Trump in \"red states like Texas and Arizona, and the battleground state of Colorado. There's a lot they like about Trump, including his independence, plainspokenness, success in business, and disdain for political correctness. They see him as strong and resolute, and not having to cater to moneyed interests since he is self-funding his campaign. And either they don't buy the idea that he is anti-Mexican, or they don't care.\"\n\nMore here.\n\nNavarette points to a poll in January that found\n\nDonald Trump is the favorite among Latino Republicans, according to new polling results revealed to The Post.\n\nThirty eight percent favor Trump, followed by Cuban American Ted Cruz (15 percent), Jeb Bush (14 percent) and Cuban American Marco Rubio (8 percent), according to the national poll conducted by the Beck Research for the American Federation for Children.\n\nOf course, it's true that there aren't all that many \"Latino Republicans\" in the country. Running candidates such as Mitt Romney, who pushed for self-deportation by illegal Mexicans during the 2012 election, will do that to a party. So will constantly talking about building walls on the U.S. border with Mexico, tripling the Border Patrol, stepping up immigration laws, and the like.\n\nBut it's also true that as any broadly or even narrowly defined ethnic group gets exponentially larger (as Latinos are), they will spread out over the political and ideological spectrum. And at some point, the GOP will acknowledge demographic shifts that will force them to at least reach out to Hispanics even if the party doesn't change any of its positions. The GOP risks going down the tubes nationally if it relies solely on the white vote, which is shrinking as a percentage of the overall total. As Karl Rove has noted , this is not impossible. Greg Abbott won 50 percent of the Latino vote while running for governor of Texas and George W. Bush and Rick Perry cracked the 40 percent margin in various of their state-wide elections.\n\nHere's relevant data from Pew Research on the topic:\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Biden Administration Imposes Cruel Border Restriction Barring Mexicans from Crossing to the US to Sell Blood Plasma\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nImmigration\n\nIlya Somin | 6.25.2021 3:57 PM\n\nThe Biden administration has done a great deal of good by repealing many of the harmful and unjust immigration restrictions imposed under its predecessor. Examples include raising the refugee cap , ending Trump's anti-Muslim travel bans , terminating or allowing to expire the previous administration's bans on most immigration and work visas, revoking the border \"emergency\" declaration and the accompanying diversion of federal funds to build the wall, and much else. In some cases, Biden has fallen short by failing to keep some of his promises to revoke Trump measures, most notably Title 42 expulsions . But, in such instances, administration defenders can at least say he didn't make things worse.\n\nRecently, however, the administration adopted a cruel new border restriction that goes beyond Trump, and really does make things worse in a way that is likely to kill innocent people. In this case, the main victims are not migrants, but Americans and others who need blood plasma to live. Dara Lind and Stefanie Dodt report in an article for ProPublica :\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection announced on June 15 that effective immediately, it would no longer permit Mexican citizens to cross into the U.S. on temporary visas to sell their blood plasma. A statement provided to ProPublica and ARD said that donating plasma is now considered \"labor for hire,\" which is illegal under the visitor visa most border residents use to cross into the United States to make donations....\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border is still mostly closed to \"nonessential travel\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Biden administration has said those restrictions will remain in place through at least July 21 . The travel restrictions have greatly reduced the cross-border plasma business. However, Paul del Rincon, a customs chief based in Eagle Pass, Texas, estimated in an interview posted to Facebook with broadcaster La Rancherita del Aire that even during the pandemic, 300 to 400 people crossed daily to donate plasma....\n\nBefore the pandemic, donors could make up to $40 a donation and over $4,000 a year for those who donated as often as possible. U.S. law caps donations at 104 a year, compared to Europe's recommended frequency of 33 times per year. In Mexico, selling plasma is entirely illegal.\n\nHowever, with COVID-19 causing a 20% decrease in plasma donations in 2020, according to the industry group the Plasma Protein Therapeutic Association, prices have soared....\n\n\"We know a lot of people depend on what they receive from selling plasma to support themselves in Mexico,\" del Rincon said. \"And we know the plasma centers also count on them. And this is going to hurt them.\"\n\nThe U.S. is the biggest global exporter of blood plasma - a market that reached $21 billion in 2019 - and plasma centers openly relied on cross-border donations to keep their supplies up....\n\nThe B1/B2 visitor visa used most often by Mexican border residents permits some business activity, but it does not permit Mexican citizens to work in the U.S. Before the new announcement, plasma donation fell into a legal gray area, with some CBP agents refusing to let people cross for donations but others allowing it.\n\nBlood plasma is necessary to save the lives of patients suffering from a number of different medical conditions. And, as Lind and and Dodt note, the pandemic has caused a severe shortage of blood plasma , both here and around the world (much of which depends on US supplies, because they ban payments for blood plasma in their own countries ). Especially in times of severe shortage, paying donors is essential , because unpaid donations are nowhere near sufficient to meet demand. The new border restriction will predictably exacerbate the shortage, as well as deprive many poor Mexicans of a valuable source of income.\n\nLind and Dodt point out a paternalistic rationale for the restriction:\n\n[A]s ProPublica and ARD found , frequent plasma donation was also hurting the Mexican citizens who relied on the system for money. Frequent donors were underweight and showed low levels of antibodies.\n\nTo my mind, Mexicans (and others) should be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to take the health risks involved in becoming frequent plasma donors. For many, the extra money might well be worth it. By mitigating their poverty, it might even enable them to improve their overall health, in the long run.\n\nOne can argue that it is unjust for people to be in a situation where their only realistic options are dire poverty or taking a health risk. But, if so, that injustice cannot be alleviated by further reducing the range of alternatives available to the people in question, such that many are left with only the one they consider even worse than the other.\n\nWe should not assume that US government officials know what is best for poor Mexicans better than the latter themselves do. Such paternalism is especially worthy of condemnation by those who, like many on the left (as well as most libertarians), support the \"my body, my choice\" principle. For a more detailed critique of paternalistic rationales for banning blood plasma sales, see this excellent paper by Georgetown political philosopher Peter Jaworski.\n\nEven if reliance on paternalistic considerations here is justified, the reasonable solution is not a complete ban on plasma sales by Mexicans on B1 and B2 visas, but merely a restriction on their frequency. Only frequent donations pose significant health risks.\n\nI am not going to attempt a detailed analysis of the legal rationale for the new policy. But I will say that the argument that paid plasma donation qualifies as \"labor for hire\" strikes me as highly dubious. It is far more akin to the sale of a commodity. If a Mexican on a B1/B2 visa sells a used car or a basket of fruit while in the United States, that surely doesn't qualify as \"labor for hire.\" The same reasoning applies to selling blood plasma. The fact that the latter comes from the body doesn't strike me as a decisive difference. After all, selling a car or a fruit basket also involves using your body, in most cases (even if only to hand over the item sold to the buyer).\n\nEven if I'm wrong about this legal point (and I admit I might be), administrations of both parties have long exercised wide-ranging discretion over which visa violators and illegal border crossers to prioritize for deportation or exclusion. Biden himself has exercised that authority on a large scale . If there's ever a good reason to exercise executive discretion to prevent people from being barred or deported, it is surely a case where they are crossing for a purpose that is literally a matter of life and death!\n\nThe administration should immediately reverse this cruel and unjust policy.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Mexicans Are Coming! The Mexicans Are Coming!\n\nPolicy\n\nKerry Howley | 9.4.2007 3:10 PM\n\nMissouri Governor Matt Blunt is damn tired of this \"unnatural influx\" of people \"who openly flout the laws.\" Last year he expressed his displeasure by sending the Missouri national guard to patrol the Mexican border. Now he is at work transforming the state's police officers into immigration enforcers, directing them to send the undocumented to detention centers.\n\nMissouri, geographically adept Americans will have noted, is not a border state. Nor is it a gateway state, or a state known for it's profusion of Hispanic culture. In 2005, 2.7 percent of Missourians were of Hispanic or Latino origin, less than a fifth of the national average. The state grew more slowly than the rest of the country between April 2000 and July 2006, and little of that sluggish growth was attributable to immigration. Relatively few Mexicans looking for a new life are looking in Jefferson City.\n\nGov. Blunt is determined to hype mass immigration as a state issue, and he is not alone in his desire to preempt the migrant menace. Forty-one states enacted 171 immigration bills between January and June, and over 1,000 were proposed. As of mid-March, 104 cities and counties had considered or adopted ordinances concerning undocumented workers. But the number of bills seeking to address demographic change is less interesting than where they are coming from. And where they are coming from seems to have little to do with where the vast majority of immigrants are going.\n\nSan Diego State University Sociologist Jill Esbenshade has studied the glut of local anti-illegal immigrant ordinances in detail. In a report to be published by the Immigration Policy Center in September, Esbenshade finds that almost 80 percent of the localities where ordinances have been discussed had below the national average of Latino population share in 2000.\n\nTake Oologah, Oklahoma, birthplace of Will Rogers and a town fearful enough to ban employers from hiring undocumented workers last year. In 2000, when the last census taken, Oologah was a town of 883 residents. One percent of those residents were of Latino or Hispanic origin-9 people. The population has since grown, but no one is claiming Oologah has an immigration problem. Talking to The Oklahoman , Oologah Mayor Jerry Holland complained about \"unlawful workers taking jobs away from us,\" though, the paper noted, those workers don't seem to be showing much interest in transplanting to Oologah.\n\nOologah's ordinance, which invites residents to file complaints against businesses that employ undocumented workers, is one of three types of local ordinances aped from county to county. English-only laws are also popular, as are laws prohibiting landlords from renting to undocumented immigrants. Many of these laws are probably unconstitutional, not all have passed, some have been struck down, and most are unenforceable. Efficacy aside, they have much to say about the distribution of anti-immigration momentum, and how little that momentum correlates with actual immigration.\n\n\"It's not the number of Latino and foreign born that are creating the public perception of crisis,\" says Esbenshade, \"it's the increase.\" Ordinances, she finds, are correlated with rapid recent increase in relatively small Latino and foreign born populations. As immigrants move beyond traditional gateway cities, like Los Angeles and New York, they're pushing into whiter climes. Big city dwellers may have an expectation of demographic dynamism, an expectation not shared in places like Tulsa, Oklahoma and Hazelton, Pennsylvania. Esbenshade's study didn't include state laws, but her findings may help explain why West Virginia, whose population is less than 1 percent Hispanic/Latino, is cracking down at the same time California, at 35 percent, is extending public benefits to migrant workers.\n\nThe Califonia/ West Virginia split may seem a livable compromise, as isolated communities ban immigrants not exactly jonesing to locate in backwaters anyway. The reality is more complicated. Ordinances like those banning landlords from renting to illegal immigrants have the potential to victimize entire Hispanic populations, since it's difficult to know whether documentation is fraudulent, and thus difficult to know whether you are breaking the law any time you rent a basement to someone not obviously American. In the towns where these ordinances are taking effect, these populations tend to be small and thus vulnerable. An English-only policy going into effect in Virginia's Culpeper County, notes the Immigration Policy Center's Walter Ewing, seems to be targeted at a Latino population of 3,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri's newly deputized immigration enforcers have claimed the right to detain even immigrants who would not otherwise be arrested. As Gov. Blunt fills the state's detention centers, he might ponder the last time the state experienced an \"unnatural influx\" of migrants.

      "text": "The Shaky History of Mass Deportations\n\n'Operation Wetback' and 'Mexican Repatriation' worked-until they didn't.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nWhen Trump supporters envision an America made great again, they are likely picturing the 1950s : a decade in which the U.S. military was preeminent in the world, its economy enjoyed a trade surplus, and its population was homogeneous. Yet this mythical vision of the past obscures as much as it reveals. For it was during this decade that the U.S. government made commitments that would lead to futile military interventions, sapping the nation's martial confidence and economic strength. And it was during these years that a postwar civil rights movement took shape that would desegregate the South and decouple the reflexive equation of American whiteness with American citizenship.\n\nIt was squarely within the mythical 1950s that the U.S. government launched the most public effort to deport large numbers of undocumented Mexican migrants: Operation Wetback. And it's this example that many on the Trump team are citing as they seek to implement a mass deportation program. But why this campaign from 1954, when there are more recent attempts to draw experience from?\n\nThe reasons all fit into a mythical reading of the 1950s. Operation Wetback was big, bold, and public. It was effective. And it was quick. Yet, leavening myth with reality, we can now conclude its approach was short-sighted, its conduct was brutish, and its long term results were fleeting. Operation Wetback was futile. It is a cautionary tale in trusting the political platitudes and simplistic prescriptions that promise a rapid solution to the immigration crisis.\n\nThe number of undocumented border crossings, as indicated by the U.S. Border Patrol's (BP) apprehension of Mexican migrants , was rising in the years before Operation Wetback: 458,215 in 1950, 500,628 in 1951, 534,538 in 1952, and 875, 318 in 1953.  BP agents had been using various methods to stem the tide, notably fences and cross-border raids. So when President Dwight Eisenhower appointed an old classmate from West Point, Gen. Joseph Swing, as the new commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in May 1954, many hoped border enforcement would be instilled with a degree of military efficiency. Swing was soon promising a swift conclusion to the \"wetback problem.\" An economic recession, which nearly doubled the U.S. unemployment rate between 1953 and 1954, put the issue of undocumented Mexican labor migration into sharp focus for Americans.\n\nA stage was being set. The INS worked hard during the first months of 1954 to ensure American agricultural growers had a plentiful supply of documented Mexican workers. Advance public announcements of Border Patrol roundups convinced many undocumented migrants and their families to voluntarily leave the United States. The U.S. Department of State informed Mexico's government to prepare for a sudden and large influx of its nationals. Then in mid-June 1954, \"Operation Wetback\" began.\n\nBorder Patrol agents built roadblocks along routes that led to and from the border, including around Nogales, Arizona and El Paso, Texas; teams of 12 BP agents roved in jeeps, planes, and trucks throughout California, Arizona, Texas, and other parts of the country, searching for Mexicans. Public spaces such as parks, fields, and country roads were converted into temporary detention facilities as apprehended Mexican nationals, mostly men, were processed for deportation (the deportation of women and children was kept minimal because it was considered a bad look for the Border Patrol). Migrant camps, ranches, farms, restaurants, and hotels were raided for migrant workers. Journalists followed BP agents everywhere they went, photographing and documenting the apprehensions.\n\nThe INS claimed that well over 1 million immigrants exited the United States during the latter half of 1954. Nearly 27,000 were formally deported, yet the great majority of departures were voluntary .  There were accounts of harsh and abusive treatment of Mexican immigrants by BP agents. Some Mexican migrants were reportedly \"dumped\" just across the border-sometimes in the middle of the desert-with no plans for their provision. Migrants were often packed into cargo vessels and shipped from Texas to Mexico ports. In one case, migrants on a ship sailing from Port Isabel, Texas, to Veracruz, Mexico, were subjected to conditions that resembled an \" eighteenth century slave ship .\"  But the goal of Operation Wetback had been met: a militarily precise removal of foreign laborers who were stealing work from American citizens and undermining the stability of the United States. By March 1955, Swing crowed that the undocumented Mexican migration problem was resolved.\n\nOf course, there is a precedent for everything in history. The precedent for Operation Wetback was the Repatriation crisis of the early 1930s, when an estimated 300,000 Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans went back to Mexico. A sudden lack of work precipitated by the Great Depression, along with public prejudice, combined to drive them out of the country. Even though most repatriados left the United States voluntarily, their departure was coerced. News of harassment, rumors of local authorities visiting Mexicans' homes to request immigration documentation, and the general mood of persecution convinced many Mexicans to return south. Voluntary departure did not classify undocumented migrants as deportees, allowing them to apply for legal readmission to the United States once they were on the other side of the border. Local governments and railroad companies facilitated Mexicans' return southward by discounting transportation costs. Even local charities played a part in pressuring Mexicans to leave the United States by withholding services .\n\nCities throughout the United States organized campaigns to drive out Mexican workers from their communities, but Los Angeles County was considered the \"hotbed\" of repatriation-over 12,000 Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans would depart that county alone by the mid-1930s. Immigration agents and local police carried out a string of well-publicized raids, detaining and questioning thousands of persons suspected of being in the country illegally. Count officials opined that the departure of immigrants would fix rising unemployment and crime problems. The local police chief, Roy Steckel, developed a novel, 20th-century type of public inquisition called \"scareheading,\" which involved having several federal officials preside over a few arrests, ensuring that those arrests received ample publicity. Such practices created a social environment so hostile to immigrants that many left the United States willingly; indeed, historians Francisco Balderrama and Raymond Rodríguez argue that Mexicans \"elected to face deprivation in their homeland rather than endure the disparagement heaped upon them in El Norte. ...  In Mexico they might suffer hunger pains, but at least they would be treated like human beings.\"\n\nVoluntary departures suited U.S. immigration authorities just fine. Deportation proceedings-which required court hearing and background checks-were cumbersome and time-consuming processes that federal and state governments preferred not to undertake. Due process gummed up the works of mass deportation. Instead, social coercion was the ticket. By making living conditions for immigrants in the United States so intolerable, and dialing up a climate of fear to such a fever pitch, the undocumented would have no choice but to leave. Problem solved.\n\nBoth the Repatriation crisis and Operation Wetback were spurred by economic recessions, but they were underpinned by a palpable American prejudice toward immigrants. The language of exclusion was more blatant in the early 1930s. Anti-immigrant congressmen like Rep. John Box said Mexicans did \"not make good citizens\" and that they were \" dirty and diseased .\" Twenty years later, the language was nearly as direct, such as when Commissioner Swing stated that undocumented Mexican migrants constituted \"an actual invasion of the United States,\" and that the deportation program's objective was a \" direct attack ... upon the hordes of aliens facing us across the border.\" The name itself, Operation \"Wetback,\" indicates the public nature of prejudice in mid-20th century America.\n\nAnother chief characteristic shared between government deportation projects of the early 1930s and mid-1950s was the coordination of federal, state, and local authorities. It is hard to imagine such robust cooperation these days, but ironically, the channels for cooperation between local, state, and federal governments to deport immigrants have only increased in recent decades. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) made it harder for undocumented immigrants to adjust their status to that of a legal immigrant while simultaneously making it much easier for these undocumented immigrants-including minors and children-to be apprehended and deported. Under section 287(g) of the new law, local and state police could be trained to enforce federal immigration law, more offenses were deemed deportable, it was easier to deport criminals (\"expedited removal\"), and deportation decisions were made by immigration courts with stricter judicial review procedures. The IIRIRA stipulated that 28 distinct offenses including \"crimes of violence\" that carried a prison sentence of a year or more could result in deportation. Perhaps most dramatically, the law also instituted retroactive punishment, in which pre-1996 crimes that were formerly not defined as aggravated felonies-such as traffic violations-were now classified as such, providing the government grounds for deportation. Convicted residents could be deported even if they had completed their prison sentences.\n\nNot coincidentally, deportations of undocumented immigrants shot up. For most of the twentieth century up to 1990, deportations averaged about 20,000 per year. Between 1990 and 1995 they increased to 40,000 per year. During the late 1990s, after passage of the IIRIRA, deportations rose to nearly 200,000 per year. Additionally, new regulations from 2002 to 2006 allowed immigration officials to expeditiously return undocumented migrants found within 100 miles of the border up to 14 days after their actual crossing. These new measures included authorization to build a border barrier and to create the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE), which is spearheading the current deportation campaign.\n\nThe federal government's ability to deport immigrants has grown in Operation Wetback's long wake, even if public toleration for anything resembling what happened in the summer of 1954 is ambivalent. Some Americans undoubtedly want to support Trump's desire to deport millions of immigrants. Private security firms and even private citizens may soon directly participate in such efforts. And the state of Texas has offered the Trump administration the use of 1,400 acres to host deportation facilities and to build a border wall. Other Americans decry such policies , protesting what they see as an unethical and unconstitutional approach to immigration control and a federal government's blatant attempt at legal overreach. Many Democratic-leaning city and state governments offer themselves as sanctuaries to immigrants and spurn federal officials' demands that local authorities cooperate in mass deportation. Such responses to U.S. immigration policy taps into the historical example of the Sanctuary movement, which began in the early 1980s to safeguard Central American refugees who were denied asylum by the U.S. government.\n\nAmericans' disagreements over immigration cut along political, legal, economic, and even philosophical lines. A fundamental question raised by the immigration debate is who belongs in a nation-state. What makes an individual a legally-protected entity, their personhood (regardless of the nation-state) or their citizenship (because of the nation-state)? Another relevant legal question to immigration is this: are \"illegal\" aliens accorded due process because of their personhood or are they denied it because they are not citizens of the United States? The 14th Amendment-the same Constitutional statute of 1868 that created the notion of birthright citizenship (and that has been targeted recently by the Trump administration for cancellation)-also granted due process protections to all \"persons\" regardless of their citizenship status. Seen in this light, are operations like mass deportation a violation of undocumented immigrants' civil protections? The American public, its leaders and courts have debated the topic for well over a century.\n\nThe historical legacy of Operation Wetback is a flash in the pan: a momentary, shocking flame burst that quickly dissipates. It got attention and immediate results. Yet it failed to provide a lasting solution to the immigration issue. American policymakers did not consider what would happen to all the migrants deported. It was assumed that once migrants had been expelled, they would cease being a headache for U.S. leaders. That assumption was wrong. A new border crisis was proclaimed by the mid-1960s as rates of undocumented migration grew. By the early 1970s, American media broadcast panic at rising migration. One Arizona newspaper headline from March 1973 read, \"Illegal Aliens Flooding Yuma, California Area.\" Undocumented migration would continue to rise through the last years of the twentieth century, especially after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994. For critics of immigration, free trade had an unfortunate tendency of creating the conditions for the free movement of people .\n\nUltimately, Operation Wetback failed because it treated immigrants as numbers instead of people. The Trump administration is taking a similarly mistaken and ahistorical approach to the immigration problem. Present-day advocates of mass deportation would do well to consider the various factors in migrant-sending countries that lead people to the United States: crime, drug wars, weak government institutions, depressed economies. Of course, the United States is not isolated from these international factors. Indeed, in many ways the United States contributes to the problem with its proliferation of guns and consumption of illicit substances . Immigration, then, is a transnational concern that cannot be solved through domestic mass deportation programs. Instead, to find a lasting solution to the problem, policymakers must analyze and empathize with the reasons individuals make the fateful decision to leave their home country for a distant destination. And then they must legislate and negotiate accordingly.\n\nBenjamin C. Montoya is an associate professor of history at Schreiner University in Texas.

      "text": "Mexico Breaks the Glass Ceiling\n\nWill incoming Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum follow in her mentor and predecessor's footsteps?\n\nHappy Tuesday! It's officially summer here at The Dispatch : Our interns have begun to arrive, and the first softball game of the season was last night. It wasn't quite the outcome we wanted, but fun was had by all-and Steve did hit a home run.\n\nWomen in Mexico weren't granted the right to vote until 1953. But on Sunday-more than 70 years later-the country broke the highest glass ceiling there is, electing its first female president.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum-a leader in the Morena Party and the hand-picked successor of Mexico's current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO)-won in a landslide victory. The vote is still being tallied, but official preliminary projections showed Sheinbaum defeating Xóchitl Gálvez, her main opponent, by more than 30 points . Gálvez conceded on Monday.\n\n\"For the first time in 200 years of the republic,\" Sheinbaum said in her victory speech early Monday morning, \"I will become the first woman president of Mexico.\"\n\nWith AMLO's Morena Party poised to potentially secure a supermajority in the Mexican Congress and inheriting a dire security situation, the question hanging over Sheinbaum's presidency is how closely she plans to hew to her predecessor and mentor's agenda-particularly on a controversial package of proposed constitutional reforms that critics argue will erode democratic norms and weaken checks and balances on the executive's power.\n\nTens of millions of people turned out to vote Sunday to select some 20,000 government officials at the local, state, and federal levels in what was the largest election in Mexican history. \"It's an incredible experience to witness how much citizen participation there is in order to have these elections,\" Lila Abed, acting director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, told TMD on election day. Abed served as an international electoral observer in Mexico City on Sunday, helping monitor election administration at polling stations.\n\nVoters gave another stamp of approval for AMLO and Morena with Sheinbaum as the new standard bearer. The 61-year-old is the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants who fled Europe and a climate scientist by training. Along with being the first female president, she's also the first Jewish person to hold the office.\n\nRival opposition parties, the National Action Party (PAN), the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), formed a loose coalition-dubbed Strength and Heart for Mexico-to challenge Sheinbaum and Morena. Gálvez, a former senator and businesswoman, led the opposition, running on a platform of restoring democratic checks and balances undermined by AMLO, combating violence, and reversing the growth of the military's involvement in civilian life.\n\nThe race became a referendum on AMLO's term-limited six years in power. \"The decision is simple,\" Sheinbaum said at a campaign event in April. \"Do you want to continue the transformation started by President López Obrador, or do we want to return to a past of corruption and privileges?\"\n\nVoters seemed to agree with her framing of the stakes, carrying Sheinbaum and Morena to a decisive victory. Gálvez secured less than 30 percent of the vote, and Morena appears to have restored its supermajority -which it lost in the 2021 midterms-in the lower chamber of Congress. According to one projection , Sheinbaum's party also came just a few seats short of such a supermajority in the Senate, although the final results have yet to be announced. That said, political analysts believe Morena could work with some of the minority parties in the Senate to secure the two-thirds majority vote required on votes to amend the country's constitution.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Sheinbaum's political career has been closely tied to AMLO. She first entered public service in 2000, serving as the secretary of the environment for Mexico City when AMLO was mayor there. She left that post to work on AMLO's 2006 presidential campaign and briefly served in the faux \" legitimate government \" that AMLO set up after he refused to accept defeat. Sheinbaum joined AMLO's Morena Party after its inception in 2014 and eventually became mayor of Mexico City in 2018, before launching a bid for the Morena nomination for president last summer.\n\n\"I promise to protect López Obrador's legacy,\" she said at her final campaign rally last week.\n\nWhat kind of legacy will Sheinbaum be stewarding? AMLO came into power promising a \" Fourth Transformation \" of Mexico-a government agenda he defined as on par with transformational events in Mexico's history, such as Mexican independence from Spain in the early 19th century. Blending old-school leftist ideology with populism and a cult of personality, AMLO pushed the government in a more statist direction and away from what he described as a \" neoliberal model \" that he argued perpetuated corruption and social and economic inequality. He significantly expanded the government's role in the energy sector, boosting state-owned enterprises over their private competitors, and initiated huge public works projects. He also reimagined Mexico's social welfare system, raising the minimum wage and universalizing federal pensions . The social programs have been so popular that Gálvez ran on expanding some of them.\n\nLess popular is the security situation in Mexico. \"Under his administration, there's been more than 180,000 homicides, the highest record of homicides,\" Abed said. More than 30,000 people have been murdered each year since AMLO took office. Wary of previous bloody drug wars, AMLO instituted a security strategy of \" hugs, not bullets ,\" focused on the root causes of crime rather than taking on criminal organizations and the cartels directly. He abolished the federal police-creating the National Guard in its place-and arrests plummeted .\n\nThe violence marred the election. At least 37 candidates -mostly at the state and local level-were assassinated this cycle, and at least 100 government officials and political activists have also been killed. \"The 'hugs, not bullets' policy, what it means in practice is basically that the government just steps back and doesn't contest territory anymore,\" said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"When you've got a vacuum, you've got an uncontested space, it's going to be filled in-in this case, in many parts of the country, it's been filled with local criminal organizations.\"\n\nWhile many Mexican women celebrated the historic occasion yesterday, Sheinbaum will lead a country where women face elevated levels of violence and insecurity: As of July 2023, 10 women and girls are killed every day , and the number of disappeared women has skyrocketed in recent years. Sheinbaum said she plans to implement policies to combat gender-based violence like creating an anti-femicide prosecutor's office. But she's also pledged to continue her mentor's broader security strategy -and voters didn't punish Morena at the ballot box for failing to stem the violence despite ranking it as a top concern in polls leading up to the election.\n\nAMLO's most enduring legacy could be his attempts to reshape Mexico's political system. \"AMLO has expanded the powers of the executive well beyond what the constitution mandates or allows,\" Berg told TMD . A key pillar of that expansion has been the unconstitutional growth of the military's role in previously civilian functions, from managing customs and building government bank branches, to running a commercial airline and constructing a massive tourist train line in the Yucatan peninsula that the army will control via a state-owned company.\n\nThroughout his term, AMLO repeatedly attacked attempts to check his executive power from elsewhere in the government or civil society, including the judiciary, the press, and the National Electoral Institute (INE)-the independent public agency that organizes federal elections. \"The Supreme Court has been the real check and balance to the executive branch, more so than Congress,\" Abed, of the Wilson Center, told TMD . \"It has really faced AMLO frontally and said, 'You can't do all of these things because they are unconstitutional.'\"\n\nBut in February , the outgoing president released a series of proposed constitutional reforms designed to cement the executive and ruling party's power. Chief among them: making Supreme Court justices (and all other judges and magistrates) directly elected as opposed to nominated by the president and confirmed by Congress. AMLO also pushed to make the leaders of the INE directly elected, reduce the number of lawmakers in both houses of Congress, put the military in full control of the National Guard, and abolish several independent government agencies and reconstitute them under the control of the executive.\n\n\"It could very much debilitate Mexico's democratic institutions and separation of powers and checks and balances, which is fundamental for any democratic system,\" Abed argued.\n\nThe timing of AMLO's proposals wasn't random. \"The slew of reforms that AMLO put forward in February, he knew that they were dead in the water,\" Berg said. \"He knew that they weren't going to go anywhere because Morena didn't have the majority. But what they essentially serve as is a blueprint for [Sheinbaum's] administration, should she get the numbers that she needs [in Congress].\"\n\nBut a quirk in the timing of the presidential inauguration could enable AMLO to pass some of the reforms himself in the waning days of his presidency with the bolstered Morena power in the new Congress. \"AMLO will have 30 days to engage with the new Congress from September 1 when it starts to October 1 when the new president takes office,\" said Abed, who spoke to TMD before the projected results were in. \"In that 30-day period, if he does have the two-thirds majority, he's going to speed through all of [the proposals], trying to get as many of them approved.\"\n\nThe outgoing president suggested yesterday that he'd defer to Sheinbaum on the bills. \"We have to reach an agreement with Claudia on these bills,\" he said . \"I don't want to impose anything.\" The 70-year-old politician also reaffirmed his intention to fully retire from public life at the end of his term.\n\nBeyond domestic policy, it's unclear how Sheinbaum will approach foreign affairs. AMLO cared little for international issues, insisting \"the best foreign policy is a good domestic policy.\" The incoming president said little about her foreign policy goals during the campaign, but relations with Mexico's neighbor to the north will no doubt be a central priority.\n\nChris Landau, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 2019 to 2021, told TMD on Sunday that he didn't expect anything fundamental to shift about U.S.-Mexico relations if Sheinbaum won. The X factor, he argued, would be who wins the U.S. presidential election in November. \"If President Trump is reelected, I think he's going to be much more anxious for Mexico to take a much more proactive role on the border and on security issues than it has, and is not going to be shy about using all the levers the United States has to do that.\" While president, Trump threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in 2019 to secure cooperation on slowing the flow of migrants to the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA), the trade pact that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, is due for review in 2026 , and Mexico's growing economic relationship with China could potentially threaten the agreement. \"There's a very good chance, especially if Trump is president, that the USMCA will not be renewed,\" Landau argued. \"The Mexicans are putting their entire economy at risk if they are welcoming Chinese investment.\"\n\nBut Mexico's immediate future will depend on how much room and or desire Sheinbaum has to differentiate herself from her mentor. \"Striking that balance of making a mark of her own, but making sure that she's loyal and keeps to her word in terms of continuing AMLO's government's policies,\" Abed said. \"That's going to be the really hard and challenging work that she will have ahead.\"\n\nVariety : Elon Musk's X Now Officially Allows Porn After Update to Policies\n\nThe Hill : Trump Attorney: Melania [Trump's] Absence at Husband's Trial Not for 'Lack of Love and Support'\n\nMediaite : RFK Jr.'s Running Mate Says She and Tucker Carlson Are 'So On the Same Page In Every Single Way'\n\nMaggie Rogers' new album, Don't Forget Me , may be-in your Morning Dispatchers ' humble opinions-one of the greatest of the year so far.

Some activist groups on Friday were calling for a boycott of American brands.\n\nFormer President Felipe Calderon said Thursday that \"we have to design a policy of retaliation\" for Trump's proposed plans, which include making Mexico pay for the border wall he wants to build.\n\n\"We have to put U.S. security issues under review ... including the presence of (U.S.) agents\" on Mexican soil, Calderon told local news media.\n\nThe comments came after current President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned Tuesday meeting with Trump after the American president tweeted that it would be better to cancel if Mexico wasn't willing to pay for his proposed wall.\n\nRuben Aguilar, a political consultant who was spokesman for former President Vicente Fox, noted Friday that Mexico has been stopping Central American migrants before they reach the U.S. border \"as part of the logic between two friendly countries.\"\n\nHe suggested that Mexico could say, \"Okay, I'm not going to stop Central Americans anymore,\" and added, \"Now if our two countries aren't friends anymore, that is a card we could play to increase the pressure.\"\n\n\"Drugs are another\" possible card, Aguilar said. \"If you want to stop them with your wall, well we won't stop them anymore, let them go through.\"\n\nTrump appeared to try to defuse the spat between the two countries Friday, saying, \"Great respect for Mexico, I love the Mexican people.\"\n\n\"We have really, I think, a very good relationship, the president and I, and we had a talk that lasted for about an hour this morning, and we are going to be working on a fair relationship,\" Trump said.\n\nThe office of the Mexican president confirmed the call, calling it \"constructive and productive,\" but did not specifically mention the wall or other policies proposed by Trump it doesn't agree with.\n\nPena Nieto's government instead stressed \"the need for both countries to continue working together to stop the trafficking of drugs and the flow of illegal weapons.\"\n\n\"Both presidents recognized their clear and very public differences on this very sensitive issue, and agreed to solve those differences as part of an integrated discussion of all aspects of the bilateral relationship,\" Pena Nieto's office said. \"The two presidents also agreed, for the moment, to no longer speak publicly about this controversial topic.\"\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim called for \"national unity\" in the face of Trump's hostility, and said the country should have a measured response \"without getting angry but without surrendering.\"\n\nSlim called for a \"modern, not protectionist\" national program of substituting imported products, the vast majority of which come from the United States.\n\nBut he stopped short of calling for a boycott of American goods.\n\n\"I think it is an error to think about boycotting companies,\" Slim said. \"What we should do instead is buy what is produced in Mexico.\"\n\nA coalition of Mexican farm and consumer groups, however, did call for such a boycott when it raised the battle flag on Jan. 18, two days before Trump took office.\n\nThe campaign's slogan - \"Consumers cry war!\" - echoes the first line of Mexico's national anthem as it calls on Mexicans to buy national products.\n\n\"The statements and threats from the U.S. president-elect are irrational and unacceptable, but they should awaken a rational response, and lead us to radically change in our model of national development, and recover sovereignty over our food system,\" the coalition said in a statement.\n\nIn a country where U.S. chain restaurants, coffee shops and stores are now ubiquitous, social media users created long strings of hashtags such as #AdiosStarbucks #AdiosCostco, #AdiosWalmart, #AdiosMcDonalds, #AdiosProductosGringos , #ConsumoProductosMexicanos.\n\nPeter Schechter, senior vice president for strategic initiatives at the Atlantic Council, said the dispute may awaken underlying currents of resentment in Mexico. The U.S. took away almost half of Mexico's territory in the 1848 Mexican-American War, though that historic resentment had faded in the last three decades.\n\n\"All this does is to solidify the view that an attempt to negotiate with the United States under this administration is impossible, and that we should break from the United States,\" Schechter said. \"This argument has moved from incredulous, to possible in people's minds. The next step is it moves from possible, to the right thing, and that step is not that far.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nDemand in America for Mexican farmhands, landscapers and other temporary workers is surging as the Trump administration moves to curb immigration and renegotiate its trade relationship with Mexico.\n\nThat demand is prompting both countries to search for ways to ease labor shortages in key parts of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn the first nine months of fiscal 2017, which began Oct. 1, the U.S. Labor Department certified more than 160,000 temporary workers -- the bulk of them from Mexico -- to harvest berries, tobacco and other crops in the U.S. under the H-2A agricultural visa program. That was up 20% from the period a year earlier.\n\nThe annual issuance of H-2A visas nearly doubled from 85,248 in fiscal 2012 to 165,741 in 2016. The U.S. doesn't cap the number of these visas.\n\nOutside of agriculture, use of another type of seasonal-work visa also has surged in response to increased U.S. demand for unskilled laborers such as hotel housekeepers. The Department of Homeland Security in July raised the annual cap on H-2B visas by more than 20% to 81,000. The majority of workers receiving this type of visa also are from Mexico.\n\nAmong the employers that applied in the past year for guest workers under the H-2B program are two operations owned by the Trump Organization, the real-estate company controlled by President Donald Trump's family: the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and a Virginia vineyard. The Trump Organization declined to comment.\n\nIn raising the cap, DHS said it had \"considered the needs of American businesses and other factors, including the impact on U.S. workers.\"\n\nAmerican farmers for several years have voiced concerns about labor shortages, often paired with complaints about the H-2A visa program, which many see as overly bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming. The program requires employers to pay for food, housing and transportation for seasonal guest workers. Still, most farmers say the program is crucial to the U.S. agricultural industry.\n\n\"It's extremely burdensome,\" but cutting the program would \"bring the industry to its knees\" because there aren't enough U.S.-born farmworkers, said Steve Scaroni, owner of large-scale farms in several states and founder of Fresh Harvest, one of the largest recruiters of H-2A workers in the U.S. \"Within a week there wouldn't be salad in the store\" if the program was canceled, he said.\n\nIn 2015, farmers in California's Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, which grow roughly 30% of the strawberries in the U.S., reported $13 million in losses because they lacked enough labor to harvest their crops in a timely manner.\n\nLast year, vegetable farmers in the two counties reported they had 22% fewer workers than needed on average, while berry farmers put the worker shortage at 26%, according to a survey conducted by a local growers association.\n\n\"It's been a dire and ongoing problem for a few years,\" said Claire Wineman, the association's president.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump unveiled legislation alongside two Republican senators that would make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based and change how the country issues permanent resident cards to foreigners with the aim of raising wages. The proposal doesn't address temporary worker visas.\n\nIn early July, Mr. Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico agreed to explore new ways of allowing Mexican guest workers into the U.S., but stopped short of committing to an expansion of existing visa programs.\n\nMexico's government argues that the guest-worker programs help tamp down on illegal border crossings, a Trump administration priority.\n\n\"If there are possibilities to have legal, temporary immigration, that deals with the problem of the work force supply, and then you won't have an illegal immigration problem,\" said Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's economy minister.\n\nThe U.S., Mexico and Canada are set to start renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement on Aug. 16. Mr. Guajardo said the renegotiation would likely address Nafta's professional visa program, which allows some skilled workers to live and work in Nafta countries.\n\nAdvocates for migrants have pushed to expand that program to include a broader range of professions. But U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a recent interview that the Nafta talks likely won't address the concerns by U.S. growers about labor shortages.\n\nTemporary worker visas are controversial in Washington. In May, a bipartisan group of four U.S. senators wrote to the DHS urging it not to raise the cap on H-2B visas. They argued the program \"puts all workers at risk\" by eliminating U.S. jobs and depressing wages for American laborers, and by allowing some employers to abuse foreign guest workers, deprive them of wages and engage in human trafficking.\n\nImmigration lawyers and migrant-rights groups say fraud in the recruitment of temporary workers is rising.\n\n\"We're really seeing an explosion in the H-2A program,\" said Rachel Micah-Jones, founder of the Center for Migrant Rights, a Mexico City organization that provides legal services to guest workers. \"And we're hearing from workers that they're feeling more vulnerable.\"\n\nThe organization received 242 complaints related to fraud and other abuse by recruiters of Mexican guest workers in 2016. Complaints have risen by 30% so far this year.\n\nSome employers garnish wages to cover the cost of transporting and housing workers, or discriminate against workers based on age or gender. Some recruiters charge fees to workers for scheduling visa interviews and arranging job contracts with U.S. companies, which is illegal under both U.S. and Mexican law.\n\nJosé Gabriel Mayorga, a 23-year-old who earns less than the equivalent of $6 a day working in fields of corn and beans in a mountainous region of Mexico's central Hidalgo state, paid close to $2,000 in June to a recruiter who promised him and his cousin 11-month contracts to pick lettuce and cucumbers in Ohio for $1,300 a week.\n\nAfter taking the money, allegedly for administrative fees to process their visas, the recruiter disappeared, Mr. Mayorga said.\n\n\"Every day we hear about more and more fraud,\" said Adareli Ponce Hernández, an activist in Hidalgo who helps workers seeking temporary visas. Ms. Ponce worked for five years at a chocolate factory in Louisiana on an H-2B visa. When she tried to apply for a new job with higher wages, she was deceived three times by shady recruiters, she said.\n\n\"It's a fundamental part of this that there be transparency in recruitment,\" she said.\n\nWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nAugust 08, 2017 05:44 ET (09:44 GMT)\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nMexico's president asked consumers on Thursday to use less electricity in the evenings as a measure to help overcome shortages of natural gas from Texas , which is seeking to ban exports of the fuel during freezing weather.\n\nMexico generates the majority of its power from natural gas, mostly imported from the United States. Latin America's second-largest economy has reeled as imports via pipeline from Texas dropped by about 75% over the last week, causing billions of dollars of losses on power outages and factory closures.\n\nThe Mexican peso weakened as much as 1.32% on Thursday, leading losses across Latin American currencies in what analysts said reflected concerns about the economy. One forecaster warned the shortages could dent Mexico's fragile recovery from pandemic restrictions.\n\nTEXAS BLACKOUTS WAKE-UP CALL FOR AMERICA'S ENERGY CAPITAL\n\n\"I call on all Mexicans to help us by consuming less,\" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said, suggesting people switch off extra lightbulbs during the peak evening hours.\n\n\"To be totally sure that our electricity system is maintained and that we don't suffer from blackouts.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said no natural gas should be supplied out of the state before Feb. 21 as it struggles to provide power during a rare cold snap, although it was unclear if he would be able to enforce the ban.\n\nLopez Obrador said Mexico's foreign ministry was making diplomatic efforts to stop the ban, but said Mexico was not retaliating against Texas, which in 2020 exported goods worth some $89 billion to its neighbor.\n\n\"I want to make this clear, there is no reprisal, this is a difficult circumstance for them, and they think that by closing they protect Texas,\" he said.\n\nTEXAS STORM SHUTTERING GREEN ENERGY AN 'AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY': EX-ENERGY SECRETARY\n\nEconomy Minister Tatiana Clouthier said on Thursday she had spoken to Roberta Jacobson, an aide to President Joe Biden , to seek \"immediate solutions,\" the day after contacting the top U.S. representative in Mexico with concerns over the impact to the economy.\n\nJose Luis de la Cruz, director of the Institute for Industrial Development and Economic Growth (IDIC), forecast that the work stoppages from the supply shortfall would erase one percentage point from Mexico's gross domestic product in the first quarter this year.\n\n\"The whole north is stopped,\" he said.\n\nAutomakers Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen and Audi all reported disruptions to their Mexico operations.\n\nTexas's freeze entered a sixth day on Thursday, as the largest energy-producing state in the United States grappled with massive refining outages and oil and gas shut ins. The cold has killed at least 21 people and knocked out power to more than 4 million people in the state.\n\nBROUILLETTE: US MUST NOT BE 'OVER RELIANT' ON ONE FORM OF ENERGY\n\nMexico has said it has alternative energy sources including two liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes to be used for power generation, expected to arrive on Thursday, according to government officials.\n\nOfficials from state electricity utility CFE said alternative supplies could generate 30,000 MW of 38,000 MW demand. State oil company Pemex has agreed to supply more fuel oil and diesel to power plants, and Mexico is also leaning on its coal supplies and hydroelectric capacity, they said.\n\n\"We cannot rely on one single fuel for power generation,\" Lopez Obrador said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the gap between alternative supplies and demand would be covered by gas imports from the United States and other sources, or would lead to further shortages.\n\nThe two LNG tankers expected to arrive on Thursday are bound for Mexico's Altamira and Manzanillo ports, the officials said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Malaysia-flagged LNG tanker Seri Balhaf departed from Freeport, Texas on Wednesday.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nJuan Hernandez, who was an advisor to former Mexican President Vicente Fox, weighed in on Donald Trump's meeting with Mexican President Pena Nieto and the immigration debate in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\n\n\"Well, it sounds I know kind of funny but in Mexico people are saying, 'Pena Nieto has a lot in common with Trump - we Mexicans don't like either one.' Pena Nieto is down in the 20s in his approval in Mexico,\" Hernandez told the FOX Business Network's Stuart Varney.\n\nHernandez explained why he is not supporting Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in this presidential election.\n\n\"As Latinos, we're so tired of the insults on the one hand, from the right, from the [?] - and I'm a Republican - but from this guy Trump. But also by the way, by the unkept promises of the left.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nYou can score another defeat for The Coca Cola Co and Pepsico in the soda wars.\n\nResults are in from a controversial soda tax in Mexico, and it appears to be achieving the outcome that health advocates had hoped for. Mexico passed the tax in 2013, which adds a 1-peso charge, or about $0.06 to bottlers for every liter of sugar-sweetened soft drinks distributed, adding about 10% to the price.\n\nAccording to researchers from the University of North Carolina, soda sales in Mexico fell 6% last year, and the decline accelerated over the course of the year, reaching 12% in December. The study also noted that the drop-off was most pronounced among low-income Mexicans, falling by as much as 17% and suggesting that the tax itself was the cause for declining sales and not publicity or changing attitudes.\n\nMexican Coke isn't flying off the shelves as fast as it used to.\n\nThough the effects of a small tax south of the border may be dismissed by some industry advocates, Mexico is no ordinary country when it comes to the soda wars. Our neighbors to the south have embraced American eating habits more than any other nation. In 2013, it became the most obese country in the world, passing the United States, and also led the world in soda consumption as of 2011. At that time, its per-capita consumption was 163 liters a year, or 40% greater than the U.S.With a population of 122 million, Mexico is also one of the highest global consumers of the fizzy stuff. That high consumption rate and the obesity and health epidemics like diabetes and heart disease that sprang from it are exactly what prompted the soda tax in the first place. Now, health advocates in the U.S. see a strong argument for imposing such a tax stateside.\n\nThe new cigarette It's become trite by now to draw analogies between soda and cigarettes, but the latest evidence from Mexico ties the two even more closely together. Cigarette taxes went through similar political battles as tobacco companies fought fiercely against them, but the evidence is clear. Cigarette taxes, which range as high as $4.35 a pack in New York at the state level and $6.16 in Chicago at the local level, have had a pronounced effect on sales. A 10% increase in cigarette prices on average leads to a consumption decline of 3-5% and has the added bonus of deterring kids from ever trying smoking in the first place.\n\nCurrently, the only soda tax in effect in the U.S. is in Berkeley, Calif. The penny-an-ounce tax was passed overwhelmingly last year, and brought in a $116,000 in revenue for the small city in its first month in March.However, a recent study by Cornell and the University of Iowa found the tax was often ignored, and in many cases less than half of the cost was being passed on to consumers. The researchers found that in the case of Coke and Pepsi, only 22% of the tax was being passed on. One problem could be concerns about cross-border competition as vendors may be worried that their customers can simply visit one of Berkeley's neighbors to avoid the tax. Overall, however, researchers say Mexico's tax offers a much more conclusive result than Berkeley's.\n\nWhat's a beverage giant to do? With other municipalities threatening to follow in Berkeley's footsteps, soda consumption is only likely to continue declining as health concerns mount.\n\nIn the face of falling favor for their trademark product, Coke and Pepsi have done the logical thing and diversified away from soda. Coke has taken steps to branch out including making investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage while Pepsi counts major food brands such as Tropicana, Frito-Lay, and Quaker under its corporate umbrella. Just this week, both Pepsi and Coke were said to be battling to take stakes in greek yogurt-maker Chobani, though Coke has since backed out, saying it prefers to stay within beverages.\n\nBoth soda giants have seen the light. Though carbonated drinks will continue to generate gobs of cash flow for each of these corporate titans, future growth will have to come from outside of soda.\n\nThe article Mexico Has Some Bad News for Coke and Pepsi originally appeared on Fool.com.\n\nJeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nPresident Donald Trump waves as he steps off Air Force One after arriving, Friday, June 7, 2019, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.  (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced late Friday that he had suspended plans to impose tariffs on Mexico, tweeting that the country \"has agreed to take strong measures\" to stem the flow of Central American migrants into the United States. But the deal the two neighbors agreed to falls short of some of the dramatic overhauls the U.S. had pushed for.\n\nA \"U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration\" released by the State Department said the U.S. \"will immediately expand the implementation\" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will \"offer jobs, healthcare and education\" to those people, the agreement stated.\n\nMexico has also agreed, it said, to take \"unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,\" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking \"decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,\" the State Department said.\n\nThe move puts to an end - for now - a threat that had sparked dire warnings from members of Trump's own party, who warned the tariffs would damage the economy, drive up prices for consumers and imperil an updated North American trade pact. Trump's Friday night tweet marked a sharp reversal from earlier in the day, when his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters: \"Our position has not changed. The tariffs are going forward as of Monday.\"\n\nMexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, \"Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided.\" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday.\n\nThe changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The U.S. announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded - a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients.\n\nHomeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began Jan. 29. More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the U.S. border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim.\n\nAny sizable increase may also be difficult to achieve. At the San Ysidro crossing alone, Mexico had been prepared to accept up to 120 asylum seekers per week, but for the first six weeks only 40 people per week were returned.\n\nTrump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the U.S. would \"impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP.\" U.S. officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nAfter returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, \"I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico.\" He wrote that the \"Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.\"\n\nHe said Mexico has agreed to work to \"stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border\" and said those steps would \"greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.\"\n\nThe 5% tax on all Mexican goods , which would increase every month up to 25% under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts. Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider - or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue - citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.\n\nFrom the moment Trump announced the tariff threat, observers wondered whether he would pull the trigger, noting his habit of creating problems and then claiming credit when he rushes in to solve them.\n\nIn late March, Trump threatened to shut the entire U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico didn't immediately halt illegal immigration. Just a few days later, he backed off that threat, saying he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken. It was unclear, however, what - if anything - Mexico had changed.\n\nU.S. and Mexican officials met for more than 10 hours Friday during a third day of talks at the U.S. State Department trying to hash out a deal that would satisfy Trump's demand that Mexico dramatically increase its efforts to crack down on migrants.\n\nThe talks had been focused, in part, on attempting to reach a compromise on changes that would make it harder for migrants who pass through Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S., those monitoring the situation said. Mexico has long opposed such a change but appeared open to considering a potential compromise that could include exceptions or waivers for different types of cases. The joint declaration, however makes no mention of the issue.\n\nLeaving the State Department Friday night, Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said he thought the deal struck \"a fair balance\" because the U.S. \"had more drastic proposals and measures at the start.\"\n\nBut Leticia Calderón Cheluis, a migration expert at the Mora Institute in Mexico City, said the agreement is essentially a series of compromises solely by Mexico, which she said committed to \"a double clamp at both borders.\"\n\nTrump in recent months has embraced tariffs as a political tool he can use to force countries to comply with his demands - in this case on his signature issue of immigration. Beyond Trump and several White House advisers, though, few in his administration had believed the tariffs were a good idea, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. Those people had worried about the negative economic consequences for Americans and argued that tariffs - which would likely spark retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports - would also hurt the administration politically.\n\nRepublicans in Congress had also warned the White House that they were ready to stand up to the president to try to block his tariffs, which they worried would spike costs to U.S. consumers, harm the economy and imperil a major pending U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal .\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., greeted Friday night's news with sarcasm. \"This is an historic night!\" he tweeted. \"Now that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Colleen Long, Paul Wiseman, Lisa Mascaro, Darlene Superville and Padmananda Rama in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Shannon, Ireland contributed to this report.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nSAN YSIDRO, Calif. -- For decades, this border community has prospered because of Mexican shoppers crossing into the U.S. to buy everything from shoes to phones.\n\nBut a few years ago the value of the peso against the dollar fell by half as oil prices plummeted. American big-box stores that opened in Mexico siphoned customers away from U.S. shops.\n\nNow, business owners in the San Diego district of about 30,000 population say the decline has worsened in the last five months because of a new factor: economic and political tension between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nPresident Donald Trump came into office based in part on pledges to beef up security on the Mexican border by building a wall and renegotiating what he called unfair trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement. Business groups have cautioned the Trump administration to avoid putting Nafta's benefits at risk.\n\nSince Robert Lighthizer was approved by the Senate to be the U.S. Trade Representative in May, the Trump administration has softened its rhetoric on Nafta toward modernizing the agreement rather than a wholesale \"rethinking the issue of trade\" that Trump promised on the campaign trail.\n\nThe peso got a 4% bump after President Trump's inauguration, then tumbled as tensions escalated between the U.S. and Mexico. Late Friday the dollar was roughly flat at 18.68 pesos.\n\nThe currency fluctuations have made it less attractive for Mexicans to cross the border to shop.\n\nAll along the U.S.-Mexican border, American retailers are reporting sharp falloffs in sales this year that many attribute to tough policies on trade and immigration. Mr. Trump has insisted that Mexico would pay for a border wall, launched a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and tightened deportation rules.\n\nStepped-up deportations and border enforcement, merchants say, have discouraged many Mexicans from venturing north to shop at stores that often feature better prices and selection on everything from women's apparel to smartphones and other electronics.\n\n\"It's like a chilling effect,\" said Denise Ducheny, senior policy adviser at the University of California, San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies.\n\nStill, some Mexican shoppers said Mr. Trump's tough talk doesn't faze them.\n\n\"He's just another president,\" Arlette Mendez, a 43-year-old visitor from Mexico City, said as she entered a discount outlet mall in San Ysidro in April in search of brand-name clothing.\n\nIn Texas, the state's five biggest border metropolitan areas -- Brownsville, McAllen, Del Rio, Laredo and El Paso -- combined received 2.7% less sales tax allocations in the first quarter than the same quarter a year earlier, according to estimates by the Texas Comptroller's office.\n\nThose numbers fell to $96.8 million from $99.5 million, even as cities statewide in Texas saw a 2.44% jump in the sales tax allocations over the same period.\n\nThe same data on sales tax allocations showed gains in most other Texas cities that aren't on the border, including Dallas, up 3.8%, Fort Worth, up 7.2%, Austin, up 4.5%, and San Antonio, up 2.6%.\n\n\"It's depressing,\" said Eric Pineda, co-owner of a Cricket Wireless outlet in San Ysidro. He estimates his store has seen a 50% drop in sales so far this year compared with last year.\n\nMr. Pineda said his store, which sells cellphone plans, has suffered in part from a reluctance of Mexican customers to venture across the border. \"[April] was the worst month of the five years we have been in business, and I think it's because of the president,\" Mr. Pineda said.\n\nIn Texas, the steepest decline in shopping was reported in the Rio Grande Valley city of McAllen, where sales tax allocations fell 6.4%. Earlier this year, a social media campaign called #Adios McAllen was launched, calling on Mexican shoppers across the border in Reynosa to boycott the border city.\n\nIn El Paso, Texas, which with its cross-border counterpart Juarez makes a bi-national metropolis of about 2.5 million people, pedestrian crossings from the south declined 15.7% in February to 496,048 from 588,719 in November, while passenger-vehicle crossings decreased 4.2% to 963,659 from 1,005,512 over the same period, according to preliminary data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nEconomists say much of the shortfall represents Mexicans either making fewer shopping trips into the U.S., or none at all.\n\n\"A lot of visitors say they no longer feel welcome in the U.S. or safe,\" said Tom Fullerton, a professor of economics at the University of Texas at El Paso. \"They worry they will be subject to searches by uniformed officials and are concerned they could have their visas or passports confiscated.\"\n\nWhite House officials didn't return a call for comment.\n\nTanny Berg, a commercial property landlord in El Paso, said the vacancy rate for 100,000 square feet of retail space he and a partner control near that city's international border has doubled from 15% a year earlier to 30%.\n\n\"We have seen tenants moving out in the last two months,\" Mr. Berg said in May. \"What's really hurting us now is the Mexicans are not coming to shop here.\"\n\nMr. Fullerton said retail sales from Mexicans account for about 10% of El Paso County's $12 billion in annual retail sales, or between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion when those sales peaked in 2014. The sales dipped to about $1 billion last year due in part to the peso problems and will likely fall below $1 billion this year, he said.\n\nThe slowdown is likely to have less impact on San Diego County, whose gross domestic product of $220 billion dwarfs that of El Paso's $29 billion, according to federal data.\n\nBut it is having an outsize impact on San Ysidro, a community in the city of San Diego where about 650 of the 800 businesses are stores that cater mainly to Mexicans, said Jason Wells, executive director of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce. He said 60 stores have closed in the 18 months though May -- half of them since the election.\n\n\"That started with the peso devaluation, but the rhetoric has exacerbated that,\" Mr. Wells said.\n\nSome retailers have other theories for the sales decline. Myong Ko, who owns MK Jeans in downtown El Paso, attributes his 50% drop in sales over the past five years more to macroeconomic problems, including falling oil prices and weakness of the peso. \"It doesn't matter whether it is Mr. Trump or Mr. Obama,\" Mr. Ko said.\n\nSome stores have managed to offset the lost sales.\n\nAt San Ysidro's Asics Super Outlet, manager Daniel Torres said advertising at San Diego conventions has attracted enough business for revenue to increase 85% so far this year despite a 25% fall in foot traffic.\n\n\"We had to think outside the box,\" said Mr. Torres, who added the conventioneers, while fewer in number, tended to buy more expensive shoes.\n\nA call to a corporate spokesman for Japan-based Asics wasn't immediately returned.\n\nPolitical leaders in San Diego and Tijuana -- a binational metropolis of about five million people -- have worked in recent years to forge closer ties. Binational efforts have been launched to open a new land port of entry and extend a rail line into the U.S. In 2015 the Cross Border Xpress pedestrian bridge opened, allowing airline passengers to walk from the U.S. to board flights at Tijuana's airport.\n\n\"We will survive, but there will be damage to the economy,\" said James Clark, a cross-border business consultant in Chula Vista, Calif.\n\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nJune 04, 2017 16:35 ET (20:35 GMT)\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
