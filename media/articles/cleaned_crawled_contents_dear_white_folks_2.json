      "text": "Dear White Folks\n\nProfessor, University of Pennsylvania\n\nAt this point you have all seen the news coverage of Michael Brown's death and the protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Some of you understand why the senseless death of Michael causes fear, anger, and disbelief among African Americans in the country. Many of you have similar emotions. Still others, and it's those of you that I'm writing to, don't understand. You trust the police as they have never meant you any harm and you see them as men and women that protect you and serve your community. Often they do just that. However, experiences with law enforcement officers can be different depending on one's race. At this point, you may stop reading this essay or may call me a few names. I hope you continue to read.\n\nWhat I know is that unless you are black in America, you can't possibly understand what it's like to be black in America. You can ask questions and you can be empathetic but you can't truly understand being black in America unless you are black.\n\nWhat I understand is what it is like to be white in America. Countless people have written about the advantages that white people have, but still many whites don't understand these privileges. Whites often deny that they are safer, are held less suspect by those in authority, are assumed to be intelligent and to speak well, are more likely to be hired for jobs, and have more access to resources in society.\n\nI also know what white rage looks like. I lived with a father who hated African Americans fiercely and blamed them for everything that was wrong in his life. It's important to note that he never knew or met anyone black. I often covered my ears as my father spewed out hatred, hoping to make me a racist like him. How many times do you do this to your children in both overt and subtle ways? Do you make racist and prejudice comments about blacks?\n\nWhen I pushed back at my father -- asking why he hated blacks so much -- his answer was always 'they are lazy, stupid, and criminals.' This is the way that my father saw all black people -- through this lens. Interestingly, my father was uneducated and stole from his employer regularly. I wonder how many of you see blacks through the same lens that my father used. What would you do if you were seen through this lens? How would you feel? What would your chances be -- during a job interview, when pulled over by the police, when hailing a taxi, or sitting in a classroom -- if you were only seen through a negative, discriminatory, and racist lens? Would you be systematically discriminated against in all areas?\n\nAnd, what if you were a parent and you knew that your children were only seen through this same derogatory lens? Would you fear for their future and their lives? Take a few minutes and think about how you view black men, black women, and black children. Are your thoughts positive or negative? Research tells us that many whites, when shown pictures of blacks, have negative emotions and thoughts due to inherent prejudice and fear perpetuated by books, movies, the media, their families, and many other aspects of society. Do you? If you are honest, the answer is probably yes and this makes it difficult for you to understand how many people are angry about the killing of Michael Brown. You see him as a criminal and deserving of death as a result of the depiction of black men in society, his skin color, your own fears, and some media outlets' portrayal of his character. You don't see him as an unarmed teenager who was gunned down by a police officer. You might not wonder why he was shot so many times. You might not ask, 'If he was indeed a threat, why wasn't he shot in the shoulder or leg?' I bet you would be asking these questions if Michael Brown was your white son. I know you would be calling for justice.\n\nIn order for the lives of black people to be valued in America, it takes effort on all of our parts. We have to believe that black lives matter and that black people have dignity. Do you believe that black lives matter? When you see an African American male, do you consider his dignity or does he represent a negative stereotype in your mind?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Stand up for someone other than yourself and stand for something larger than yourself. Raised by a hateful, resentful, and racist father, I could have turned out exactly as he did but I chose love and understanding over hate.\n\nIn the end, my father chose love and understanding too. In his later years, due to a massive stroke, he lived in a nursing home in Tennessee near my younger sister. He shared a room with an African American man and his life was forever changed. It was through friendship, exposure, laughter, and love that my father rid himself of his racism, anger, and resentment and became someone I was proud to call my father. Near the end of his life, I asked him, once again, why he hated blacks throughout the majority of his lifetime. His response was truthful and telling. He said, \"Because I didn't like myself and I needed someone else to blame for my failures in life. I was wrong.\" Who do you blame for your insecurities and problems?\n\nAs I have told many people, my father, although a vehement racist for most of his life, is the impetus for much of what I do professionally and how I live my life personally. Living a life that is based on a belief in the full potential of all human beings and sees the dignity within everyone is a life of joy and hope for both you and others. I choose that life. Which one do you choose? I hope it's the life that lifts up all members of society, and especially our black brothers and sisters. Given our nation's history of dire racism and oppression, we (whites) have a deep obligation to see the humanity of blacks and ensure opportunity, equity, safety, and happiness.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Dear White Folks: This is exactly who we are\n\nProfessor and author. Lover of all things coconut.\n\n\"This is not who we are!\"\n\nAmong the heartfelt messages written in the Arabic language and scattered notes wishing peace for a departed student and his bereaved family, we have the cry of white folks:\n\n\"This is not who we are!\"\n\nOf all the possible angles with which to cover the tragic death of UW-Stout's Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, these are the words that the media seems to want to hold on to.\n\n\"This is not who we are!\"\n\nAs though Mr. Alnahdi's death is secondary to the more important issue here. A message that seems to beg, \"Listen, world, we're not racist here in the Upper Midwest. Make sure you believe that about us, first and foremost.\"\n\nAs is predictable, the coverage of Mr. Alnahdi's death is now enshrouded in more white talk: The surrounding (predominantly white) university community, having had the opportunity to \"lighten\" their \"grief,\" will soon \"move forward.\" And they will now move forward in much the way they did after the racially motivated 1982 death of Mr. Sani Tela, an African UW-Stout student who - like Mr. Alnahdi - was beaten, and then run over by a car.\n\n\"This is not who we are!\"\n\nMr. Alnahdi's death comes on the heels of Dr. Jim Loewen's visit to UW-Eau Claire, during which he shared his expert knowledge on Sundown Towns and how to identify them. For the uninitiated, Sundown Towns are all-white towns that institutionalize and enforce racial segregation, profiling and violence. According to Dr. Loewen's research, people of color were forced from white towns after dark both formally (with the support of local racist laws, policies and practices) and informally (in the face of threats, intimidation and violence). Dr. Loewen taught a captive audience about Sundown Towns a mere 25 miles from the sidewalk where Mr. Alnahdi would soon breathe his last breath at the hands of someone thus far only identified as a six-foot-tall white man.\n\n\"This is not who we are!\"\n\nIt is time, people of Wisconsin, to be a little more honest: This is exactly who we are. And it is up to us to do something about it.\n\nTo believe that this is not who we are is a privilege of never having had to wonder otherwise. Specifically, it is a white privilege.\n\nFor Mr. Alnahdi's grieving family, this is precisely who we are.\n\nFor those in the international community considering sending their children to study in the UW System (and elsewhere in the U.S.), this is precisely who we are, and they are warning their children accordingly.\n\nFor anyone paying even a modicum of attention, this is precisely who we are.\n\n\"This is not who we are!\"\n\nTell that to the Alnahdi family.\n\nAnd listen up, Eau Claire: Judging by the Nov. 1 antics, the free-wielding use of campus space for racist and violent rhetoric, and finally, the unabashed treatment of students of color - treatment that went ignored and institutionally protected by those with real power to intervene - you're not much better.\n\nBerchini is an assistant professor in the English Department at UW-Eau Claire.

      "text": "This Racist S*** Won't Change Until White Folks Put In The Work\n\nWriter. Healer. Grief Coach. Recovering Lawyer. Founder of loss&found (www.lossandfoundxo.com)\n\nAs I sit down to write this I am sad, angry and utterly bewildered. In the wake of the Charlottesville Riot , I'm not shocked (I've been living in this racialized black body far too long for that). But, I am appalled. What is shocking is how many white folks, including friends and supposed healers, are still unknowingly caught up in trying to distance themselves from the problem instead of being part of the solution.\n\nIn the past 48 hours I've had a lot of real and raw convos. I am tired . I can't say everything I need to say, nor will I say it as profoundly as I'd like. Still, if we're to have a hope in hell of turning this ship around, something needs to be said. If my children are ever to have a chance of being judged solely on their merit rather than the colour of their skin, it has to be said. So here it goes.\n\nDear white folks...\n\nYes, all of you. Unfortunately, I've already lost many of ya because I've lumped an entire race of peeps into one category, and y'all really hate that shit. Guess what! So does every other race, and yet it happens to us every damn day.\n\nI get it: I don't like grouping people into categories, either, but in this case I believe it has to be done. Because the thing is, y'all keep getting up to the same antiquated antics. The \"No, not me,\" \"But shit is getting better,\" \"We're not all racist,\" \"I'm angry, too,\" \"How am I privileged?\" bullshit that you spew out to your racialized friends, co-workers or café baristas. And we, as in the human race, simply don't have time for that shit.\n\nI can imagine the urge to resist or rationalize.\n\nListen up...\n\nWhen a racialized person exerts the immense emotional, mental, spiritual and physical energy to share some of her experience and perspective. To bare some of his immense grief. To subject herself to an inevitable barrage of white fragility in the form of defence mechanisms, hole-poking and dismissal. Please. Just. Listen.\n\nI can imagine the urge to resist or rationalize. To create a divide between yourself and \"them,\" and help cope with the shame, guilt and deep embarrassment caused by those fools waving flaming tiki torches (I guess they also hate mosquitos?).\n\nI don't know what that's like, but I can imagine. Just like you don't know what it's like to be constantly reminded - through images, speech, law and policy - that your body is disposable because of its hue and your voice dismissible because of its tone. To live in a perpetual and unequivocal state of loss and grief. And that, my light-skinned loves, is because of your white privilege.\n\nIf ya don't know, now ya know.\n\nThere are many examples of how white privilege plays out in daily life. It is insidious, ingrained and incredibly challenging to overcome, particularly because white folks have such a hard time actually acknowledging it exists. But here's the thing: \"If you don't think white privilege exists - congratulations, you're enjoying the benefits of it.\" Ain't that a bitch?\n\nListen, my sweet blanc babies, all of this must make your skin crawl and I have mad compassion for that. I do. Still, I want you to take all the heartbreak, anger, confusion etc. that you're feeling and multiply it by 1,000,000. Then multiply that by 33 years. Now take all of that sustained sorrow and try to imagine having to constantly explain to those with the most power and privilege (a.k.a. you) exactly how it is they benefit from people and systems who seek to uphold their right to that power and privilege.\n\nHead 'bout ready to explode? Cuz mine sure AF is. But this is my experience as a racialized person, and I will continue to be asked, and expected, to do exactly this. Why? You guessed it... white fuckin' privilege.\n\nYes, it must suck to feel that violent, ignorant assholes somehow represent and reflect a system that you benefit from. Like, ew. What also sucks, and in a far worse way, is to be subject to the ceaseless outward and internalized hate, fear and trauma because I fall on the shit end of the privilege stick. We're all in grief, but it ain't the same.\n\nSo... what the eff can we do?\n\nThere are so many ways you can help and your participation is essential. Below are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Own your privilege\n\nStopping asking \"if\" you're part of the problem and start asking \"how.\" Then feel all the feels. Cry. Scream. Do what you gotta do so you can get the fuck to work.\n\n2. Educate yourself\n\nNot by asking racialized people to do it for you. Educate your own damn self. Google \"white privilege\" and \"white fragility,\" bring up the issue to white folks, then ask if your racialized friends have the time or energy to engage in the topic (where your job is to simply listen).\n\nThis fight is ongoing. It is every. Damn. Day. It's everywhere, all the time.\n\n3. Commit to daily anti-racist practice\n\nI've had so many white folks tell me how upset they are but when I ask them what they're doing about it, I get blank stares.\n\nHere's the thing, if you are really and truly outraged, you have no choice but to act . Racialized folks are called into action because it is our lives and livelihoods on the line. If you aren't actually doing something - you don't actually care (and, once again, you only have the option of not caring because of your privilege). If you ain't part of the solution, you're part of the problem.\n\n4. Check in\n\nAsk your racialized brothers and sisters how their hearts are and find out how you can best support them as people , not as a representative of an entire race.\n\n5. Speak up\n\nSilence is no longer an option. And please don't pat yourself on the back just because you posted something on Instagram, or called someone out on their racist rhetoric that one time. This fight is ongoing. It is every. Damn. Day. It's everywhere, all the time. What is required here is a total paradigm shift. A complete and utter overhaul of the white patriarchal system we all operate within, know and understand (despite it being completely fucked).\n\nThe truth is that shit ain't really gonna change unless and until white folks are also willing to truly do the work. I believe in y'all and I am hopeful that together, love (and action) will prevail.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

      "text": "Paula Deen, the N-word, and Sh*t Black Folks Can't Say\n\nAuthor and Professor of English, The College of New Jersey\n\nWhile perusing the reader comments attached to news articles about the Paula Deen controversy, I have noticed a common refrain that goes something like this: \"But black people say the n-word all the time. So why can't white people say it without being publicly crucified? I can't say it, but you can? That's reverse racism.\" While I realize that whole books have been dedicated to this topic, I am going to attempt to address it in 850 words or less. So for a moment, let's set aside the fact that Paula Deen is accused of a lot more than saying the n-word. Never mind that she is alleged to have contributed to a hostile work place for black people. Let's put aside the fact that the n-word is not the only indicator of racism, any more than people who repurpose flame retardant white sheets at night are the only people participating in or benefiting from racism.\n\nDear White Folks who are freaking out over Black Folks' use of the N-word:\n\nI realize that it is disturbing to think that there might be one privilege that black people have that white people do not. Therefore, I am going to set the record straight. I have compiled a list of things that black people cannot say. This list is by no means complete. I am hoping that readers will add more items in the comments section for your further edification.\n\n1.) Black people actually cannot go around freely and randomly using the n-word. If you are relying on hip hop as your primary window into black life, I can imagine why it might appear that way. However, there are strict rules. I cannot roll into a laundromat in Trenton, NJ and say, \"What's Up N___s?\" -- not if I want to leave with all my hair in tact. Middle class black people under a certain age generally don't use this word. In my experience, I have yet to attend a dinner party where anyone said, \"pass the asparagus, N___.\" If I were to call one of my black students the n-word, I would expect to be packing up my desk by the end of the day. The ability to use the n-word is complicated. There has to be community, affinity, equality, and history. If you want to use it freely you have become a rapper and say it along with any other cultural taboos you can come up with that will help you sell records to white kids who want to hear and sing a word that they are not supposed to say. But hip hop is a performance and the n-word is a part of that performance for some rappers. Real black life (the world where you can't get paid to say the n-word) on the other hand is all together something different.\n\n2.) Black folks can't use other racial slurs at all. None of us gets a free racial slur card for being black. And when white people use racist/classist words like \"redneck\" or \"white trash\" to denigrate poor white people for daring to be white and poor, we can not use these word back, nor criticize your use of them. And let's be honest, slurs for white people are not all that powerful or satisfying. \"White trash,\" is equally a slur to blacks because the moniker \"white\" implies that trash is ordinarily black. My grandmother used to use the word \"peckerwood\" like it was going out of style, and apparently it really was. She lived most of her life under legal racial segregation and in her largely monolithic community this word meant something. But now when a white person cuts me off in traffic, such words never even cross my mind. This is not because I am a good person. Living in an integrated world, in which white people are my colleagues, dear friends, and family members, I am not even sure to whom I would say such a word. And, I am pretty sure any white person I said it to, would be either confused, amused, or both because we both know intuitively that it and I have little power to change the racial power dynamics that shape our world.\n\n3.) Though black folks have the power to call you on your use of the n-word, we rarely have the words or proof to meaningfully name the invisible forms of racism, which are equally damaging. You know that moment when we were politely chatting on the plane, and I told you I was a professor, and you looked at me wide eyed and said, \"Good for you!\" a little too loud? Or remember that time, when you complimented some black person's articulateness, cleanliness or general competence as if that person had somehow escaped the rest of the inarticulate, dirty, inept hoard of black folks. And maybe you remember the time that you interviewed that black man with the ivy league degree and in spite of yourself, you were fuming because you didn't get into that school and you were pretty sure that he should not have gotten in either. And, maybe you hired a white guy you are sure was equally qualified, but whom you just felt more comfortable with because he was a \"better fit.\" Well, you don't need to worry because in all likelihood no black person is going to call you and talk to you about anything of these things because we are pretty sure you'll call us crazy, whiny, paranoid, touchy, and more white people than not will probably agree with you. Unless you slip up and say the n-word, nobody is going to accuse you of anything, because we just can't. And besides, if we pointed out every time this stuff happened, we wouldn't have time to do anything else.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Truth to Power club takes on Ashland issues via podcast\n\nManage your account\n\nFeb. 18-A group of 15 Ashland High School students have taken to a new platform to dissect issues facing the Rogue Valley through a club called \"Truth to Power,\" which focuses on podcasting and issue-specific community events.\n\nThe club's podcast \"Tea, Toast and Truth\" centers on topics of interest for club members, such as the most recent episode focused on Ashland's homeless population. A series of interviews incorporate experiences of people fleeing from domestic violence, alienation from family, hardships brought by life without home, and for some the complexity associated with a choice to live free of four walls and a welcome mat.\n\nIn their narration, students call out perceived consequences of materialism and greed, acknowledge sources of power and influence, and embrace nuance in an often black-and-white narrative about issues of homelessness and law enforcement in Ashland.\n\nEach interview taps into an introductory theme - \"Teen talk that matters.\"\n\n\"During quarantine, we had quite a bit of time on our hands - I had a rough time just sitting still and not doing something with that time,\" said co-founder Anya Moore, sophomore. \"There (were) a lot of things in the community, and there still are, that we see that need to be changed, and a lot of improvements that we think need to be made, and people who need to have a platform to share their thoughts.\"\n\nThe club's podcast in progress takes a look into the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and its \"symbiotic relationship with the town,\" Moore said. Other planned podcast topics cover teen deaths and the effects of Zoom school.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the group presented a workshop titled \"Dear White Folks: Let's Talk About Racism,\" and a follow-up session Feb. 7 focused on how to be anti-racist, facilitated by Danielle LoPresti and Akeel Williams. The workshops were preceded by a screening and discussion of the film \"13th,\" a documentary exploring the history of racial inequity through the lens of the U.S. prison system.\n\nWorkshop attendee Daniel Murphy said his attendance was the next in a series of steps to look inward during a time of \"racial reckoning,\" adding to self education about the history of racism in the U.S. and movements toward racial healing. The facilitators offered honesty, poignancy and provocative questioning to inspire thought among the group, Murphy said.\n\n\"It's both fierce and loving at the same time,\" Murphy said of the club's approach to discussions of race, referencing Dr. Martin Luther King's writings.\n\nMoore said the workshops provided guidance and motivation for the club's future efforts, including a goal to install a mural on the AHS campus honoring Aidan Ellison and other Black alumni, a podcast on Southern Oregon's racist history, and pursuing anti-racism in their daily lives.\n\nThe name of the club puts a core belief at the forefront, said co-founder Isadora Millay - a message to encourage speaking one's innermost truth to government entities, the American people and \"to the idea of power itself.\"\n\nMillay said the club received some social media backlash for hosting a workshop calling out \"white folks\" but asserted the group would not succumb to others' discomfort with the phrase or alter their mission to further social change. By offering the workshops and seeking connection points with the public through their projects, Millay said she aims to transform passivity into active anti-racism.\n\nProject suggestions and feedback can be submitted to truthtopowerclub@gmail.com .\n\nHumanities teacher and club advisor Shane Abrams said the students have no shortage of passion and drive. Still, the standard obstacles of delegating tasks and collaborating are amplified by the pandemic, he said, and club members face the challenge of setting attainable goals without burnout.\n\n\"The gears in any institution like a school turn really, really slowly,\" Abrams said. \"The kids want to move really quickly, both because they're passionate and they're excited, but also because all the work we're doing feels really urgent.\"\n\nTruth to Power is a podcast club first, often combined with a service project suited to the topic, Abrams said. This week, the club organized a supply drive for homeless community members. For Black History Month, the club is coordinating a school-wide advisory lesson on Black activists.\n\nGoing forward, efficient and ethical podcast production, source evaluation and audio engineering may integrate into an educational component of the club, Abrams said. Thus far, he's satisfied with their podcast work.\n\n\"They're pretty clearly framing their sources as interview testimony, not definitive truth, and I admire their capacity to do that,\" Abrams said.\n\nContact Ashland Tidings reporter Allayana Darrow at adarrow@rosebudmedia.com or 541-776-4497 and follow her on Twitter @AllayanaD."
